PURPOSE

This knowledge base provides the Neural Data Science Agent with comprehensive causal inference methodology including potential outcomes framework, identification strategies, and best practices for establishing causation in marketing measurement.

CAUSAL INFERENCE FUNDAMENTALS

Understanding causation versus correlation.

CAUSATION CONCEPT

Defining causal relationships.

Causal definition
- Intervention changes outcome
- Manipulation concept
- Counterfactual reasoning
- Cause precedes effect

Causal versus correlation
- Association not causation
- Third variable problem
- Reverse causation
- Spurious relationships

Causal inference goal
- Isolate treatment effect
- Eliminate confounding
- Establish causation
- Support decision-making

FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM

Core causal inference challenge.

Counterfactual impossibility
- Cannot observe both outcomes
- Missing potential outcome
- Single realization observed
- Inference required

Identification strategies
- Randomization solution
- Design-based approaches
- Model-based approaches
- Assumption requirements

Assumption importance
- All methods require assumptions
- Untestable assumptions often
- Transparency critical
- Sensitivity analysis needed

POTENTIAL OUTCOMES FRAMEWORK

Rubin causal model foundations.

FRAMEWORK COMPONENTS

Potential outcomes elements.

Potential outcomes definition
- Outcome under treatment
- Outcome under control
- Defined for each unit
- Only one observed

Treatment effect definition
- Individual treatment effect
- Difference of potential outcomes
- Generally unobservable
- Target of estimation

Average treatment effect
- Population average of effects
- Estimable under assumptions
- Primary estimand often
- Policy relevant

CAUSAL ESTIMANDS

Target quantities for estimation.

Average treatment effect
- Population-wide average
- General effectiveness
- Policy consideration
- Randomization target

Average effect on treated
- Effect among treated only
- Selection considerations
- Practical interpretation
- Common target

Conditional average effect
- Effect within subgroups
- Heterogeneity exploration
- Targeting implications
- Personalization basis

IDENTIFICATION STRATEGIES

Methods for causal identification.

RANDOMIZATION

Experimental identification.

Randomization mechanism

IV estimation
- Two-stage least squares
- Limited information ML
