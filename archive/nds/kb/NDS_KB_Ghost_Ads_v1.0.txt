PURPOSE

This knowledge base provides the Neural Data Science Agent with comprehensive methodology for ghost ad experiments including intent-to-treat design, implementation approaches, and best practices for measuring true advertising incrementality without control group exposure.

GHOST AD CONCEPT

Understanding ghost ad methodology.

GHOST AD DEFINITION

What ghost ads represent.

Counterfactual exposure
- Ad that would have served
- Auction participation without delivery
- Intent-to-treat recording
- Clean control creation

Control group treatment
- No actual ad exposure
- Logging of would-be exposure
- Matched to treatment group
- Outcome comparison basis

Methodological advantage
- Addresses selection bias
- True randomization proxy
- Platform-native solution
- Scalable implementation

GHOST AD RATIONALE

Why ghost ads improve measurement.

Selection bias elimination
- Randomization at auction
- Equal targeting conditions
- Matched user characteristics
- Clean causal comparison

PSA alternative
- No need for placebo creative
- Cost efficiency
- Simpler implementation
- Clean holdout

Practical benefits
- Platform integration
- Minimal additional cost
- Real auction conditions
- Scalable execution

GHOST AD METHODOLOGY

Technical implementation approaches.

AUCTION-BASED IMPLEMENTATION

Ghost ads in programmatic environments.

Bid suppression approach
- Submit bid for eligibility
- Suppress delivery to control
- Log impression opportunity
- Track outcomes

Random suppression
- Randomization at bid time
- Percentage-based holdout
- Consistent user assignment
- Balance verification

Technical requirements
- DSP support
- Logging infrastructure
- Outcome tracking
- Data integration

PLATFORM-NATIVE GHOST ADS

Walled garden implementations.

Meta ghost ads
