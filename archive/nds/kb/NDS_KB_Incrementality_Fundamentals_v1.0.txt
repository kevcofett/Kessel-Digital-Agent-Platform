PURPOSE

This knowledge base provides the Neural Data Science Agent with comprehensive incrementality measurement fundamentals including causal inference principles, experimental design foundations, and best practices for measuring true marketing lift.

INCREMENTALITY CONCEPT

Understanding true marketing contribution.

CAUSAL INFERENCE FUNDAMENTALS

Distinguishing causation from correlation.

Counterfactual question
- What would happen without marketing
- Unobservable alternative outcome
- Fundamental problem of causal inference
- Estimation approaches

Incremental definition
- Additional conversions from marketing
- Above baseline conversion rate
- Causal contribution
- True marketing value

Correlation versus causation
- Marketing-conversion correlation
- Selection effects
- Confounding factors
- Causal isolation challenge

INCREMENTALITY VERSUS ATTRIBUTION

Distinguishing measurement approaches.

Attribution measures
- Credit allocation among touchpoints
- Relative contribution assessment
- Does not assess necessity
- Correlational foundation

Incrementality measures
- Causal contribution assessment
- Would conversion happen anyway
- Experimental foundation
- True lift quantification

Complementary roles
- Attribution for optimization
- Incrementality for valuation
- Calibration relationship
- Integrated measurement

SELECTION BIAS

Understanding key confound.

Targeting bias
- Marketing reaches interested users
- Pre-existing purchase intent
- Correlation without causation
- Over-attribution risk

Self-selection
- Engaged users see more ads
- High intent users click
- Correlation with conversion
- Inflated effectiveness

Timing selection
- Marketing during peak periods
- Seasonal correlation
- Event-driven marketing
- Temporal confounding

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN FOUNDATIONS

Principles for valid incrementality measurement.

RANDOMIZATION PRINCIPLES

Foundation of causal inference.

Random assignment
- Equal probability treatment assignment
- Eliminates selection bias
- Balances observed confounders
- Balances unobserved confounders

Randomization benefits
- Causal identification
- Unbiased estimation
- Statistical inference validity
- Simple interpretation

Randomization requirements
- True random mechanism
- Implementation fidelity
- Assignment concealment
- Post-randomization balance

CONTROL GROUP DESIGN

Creating valid comparison groups.

Holdout design
- Subset excluded from treatment
- Matched to treatment group
- Observed for outcomes
- Comparison basis

Control types
- No-exposure control
- Placebo control
- Standard treatment control
- Waitlist control

Control quality
- Balance verification
- Contamination prevention
- Sufficient sample size
- Representative selection

EXPERIMENT VALIDITY

Ensuring trustworthy results.

Internal validity
- Causal inference confidence
- Confound elimination
- Design execution fidelity
- Analysis appropriateness

External validity
- Generalizability of results
- Population representativeness
- Context transferability
- Time stability

Statistical validity
- Proper hypothesis testing
- Power adequacy
- Multiple comparison handling
- Assumption verification

LIFT CALCULATION

Quantifying incremental impact.

LIFT METRICS

Measuring experimental outcomes.

Absolute lift
- Treatment minus control rate
- Incremental conversion rate
- Easy interpretation
- Scale dependent

Relative lift
- Treatment divided by control
- Percentage improvement
- Scale independent
- Baseline sensitive

Lift ratio
- Relative lift expression
- Multiplier interpretation
- Common reporting format
- Comparison across experiments

LIFT ESTIMATION

Statistical calculation of lift.

Point estimate
- Observed rate difference
- Best single estimate
- Uncertainty not captured
- Decision input

Confidence interval
- Range of plausible values
- Uncertainty quantification
- Statistical significance
- Decision confidence

Bayesian credible interval
- Posterior probability interval
- Prior incorporation
- Intuitive interpretation
- Decision probability

STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE

Evaluating result reliability.

Hypothesis testing
- Null hypothesis specification
- P-value calculation
- Significance threshold
- Conclusion drawing

Power consideration
- Type II error probability
- Sample size relationship
- Effect size sensitivity
- Experiment planning

Multiple testing
- Family-wise error rate
- False discovery rate
- Correction methods
- Segmented analysis handling

INCREMENTALITY RATIO

Calibrating attributed conversions.

RATIO CALCULATION

Computing incrementality factor.

Incrementality ratio definition
- Incremental conversions over attributed
- True lift proportion
- Calibration factor
- Range zero to infinity

Calculation process
- Experimental lift measurement
- Attributed conversion count
- Ratio computation
- Confidence estimation

Interpretation
- Ratio of one means accurate attribution
- Below one means over-attribution
- Above one means under-attribution
- Calibration application

APPLICATION TO ATTRIBUTION

Using ratio for adjustment.

Attribution calibration
- Multiply attributed by ratio
- Incremental-only credit
- Conservative estimation
- Accurate valuation

Channel-specific ratios
- Different channels different ratios
- Display often lowest

- Video moderate typically

Ongoing calibration
- Regular ratio updates
- Trend monitoring
- Confidence weighting
- Model refinement
