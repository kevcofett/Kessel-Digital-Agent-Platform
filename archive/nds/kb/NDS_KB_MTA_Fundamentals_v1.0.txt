PURPOSE

This knowledge base provides the Neural Data Science Agent with comprehensive Multi-Touch Attribution fundamentals including theoretical foundations, model types, implementation considerations, and best practices for granular conversion attribution.

MTA THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS

Understanding the principles underlying multi-touch attribution.

ATTRIBUTION CONCEPT

Assigning conversion credit to marketing touchpoints.

Touchpoint definition
- User interaction with marketing
- Impression exposure events
- Click engagement events
- Video view events
- Site visit events

Credit allocation
- Distributing conversion value
- Fractional attribution
- Multi-event recognition
- Cross-channel consideration

Journey perspective
- Full path consideration
- Touchpoint sequence importance
- Time decay recognition
- Position value variation

ATTRIBUTION CHALLENGES

Fundamental difficulties in attribution.

Counterfactual problem
- Unknown alternative outcomes
- Unobservable control state
- Causal inference requirements
- Assumption dependencies

Cross-device tracking
- User identity fragmentation
- Device graph limitations
- Probabilistic matching
- Privacy constraints

Signal loss
- Cookie deprecation impact
- Tracking prevention
- Consent requirements
- Data gaps

Incrementality question
- Would conversion happen anyway
- Baseline conversion rate
- True lift measurement
- Correlation versus causation

RULE-BASED ATTRIBUTION

Heuristic approaches to credit allocation.

SINGLE-TOUCH MODELS

Assigning all credit to one touchpoint.

Last touch attribution
- Final touchpoint gets credit
- Easy implementation
- Biases to lower funnel
- Ignores awareness building

First touch attribution
- Initial touchpoint gets credit
- Values awareness creation
- Ignores conversion assist
- Simple implementation

Last non-direct click
- Excludes direct visits
- Common platform default
- Captures marketing source
- Still single-point bias

MULTI-TOUCH RULE MODELS

Distributing credit across touchpoints.

Linear attribution
- Equal credit distribution
- Simple interpretation
- No position preference
- All touchpoints valued

Time decay attribution
- Recent touchpoints weighted higher
- Decay rate parameter
- Recognizes recency importance
- Configurable decay

Position-based attribution
- First and last weighted higher
- Middle touchpoints equal share
- Common forty-twenty-forty split
- Hybrid approach

Custom rules
- Business logic encoding
- Channel-specific weights
- Touchpoint type differentiation
- Strategic alignment

RULE MODEL LIMITATIONS

Inherent constraints of heuristic approaches.

Arbitrary assignment
- No data-driven optimization
- Assumption-dependent
- Potential misattribution
- Inconsistent with true impact

No learning
- Static credit rules
- Cannot adapt to data
- Ignores journey patterns
- Missed optimization opportunity

Bias introduction
- Model choice bias
- Channel preference embedding
- Touchpoint type prejudice
- Strategic distortion

DATA-DRIVEN ATTRIBUTION

Algorithmic approaches to credit allocation.

MARKOV CHAIN MODELS

Probabilistic sequence modeling.

Markov assumption

Advantages and limitations

- Interpretable transitions
- Limited interaction capture
- Sequential assumption

SHAPLEY VALUE MODELS

Game theoretic credit allocation.

Cooperative game framework
- Channels as players
- Conversion as game value
