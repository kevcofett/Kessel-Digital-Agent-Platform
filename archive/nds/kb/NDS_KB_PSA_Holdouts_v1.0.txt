PURPOSE

This knowledge base provides the Neural Data Science Agent with comprehensive methodology for public service announcement holdout experiments including design principles, creative development, and best practices for measuring advertising incrementality using placebo controls.

PSA HOLDOUT CONCEPT

Understanding PSA-based incrementality measurement.

PSA HOLDOUT DEFINITION

What PSA holdouts accomplish.

Placebo advertising
- Non-commercial ad to control
- Matched exposure conditions
- Controls for attention
- Isolates brand effect

Control treatment
- Ad exposure equivalent
- No brand messaging
- Neutral content delivery
- Comparison baseline

Methodological benefit
- Controls attention effect
- Matches ad environment
- Isolates brand contribution
- Conservative measurement

PSA VERSUS NO-AD CONTROL

Comparing control approaches.

No-ad holdout
- No advertising to control
- Cleaner incrementality
- Does not control attention
- May overstate effect

PSA holdout
- Matched ad exposure
- Attention controlled
- Isolates brand value
- Conservative estimate

Choosing approach
- Research question match
- Available resources
- Stakeholder preferences
- Measurement precision

PSA CREATIVE DEVELOPMENT

Creating effective placebo ads.

CREATIVE PRINCIPLES

Guidelines for PSA design.

Neutrality requirements
- Non-commercial content
- No brand association
- Generic messaging
- Category independent

Engagement matching
- Similar visual quality
- Comparable production
- Matched attention capture
- Format consistency

Format alignment
- Same ad specifications
- Duration matching
- Placement compatibility
- Platform compliance

PSA CONTENT OPTIONS

Types of PSA content.

Charitable messaging
- Nonprofit promotion
- Cause awareness
- Generic public good
- Positive sentiment

Generic awareness
- Health and safety messages
- Environmental awareness
- Community messaging
- Unbranded information

Abstract creative
- Non-message content
- Visual patterns
- Neutral imagery
- Attention equivalent

CREATIVE PRODUCTION

Developing PSA assets.

Production requirements
- Professional quality
- Multiple formats
- Platform specifications
- Rotation capability

Cost considerations
- Production investment
- Versus commercial creative
