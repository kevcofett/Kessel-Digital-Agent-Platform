DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY

Mathematical privacy guarantees.

DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY CONCEPT

Formal privacy definition.

DP definition
- Bounded influence
- Individual contribution limited
- Statistical indistinguishability
- Privacy parameter epsilon

Privacy guarantee
- Query result similarity
- With or without individual
- Plausible deniability
- Formal bound

Epsilon interpretation
- Privacy budget
- Lower more private
- Higher more accurate
- Trade-off management

DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY MECHANISMS

Implementation approaches.

Laplace mechanism
- Add Laplace noise

- Attack prevention
- Diversity threshold

T-closeness
- Distribution similarity
- Population comparison
- Attribute distribution
- Distance threshold

COHORT-BASED APPROACHES

Group-level measurement.

Cohort concept
