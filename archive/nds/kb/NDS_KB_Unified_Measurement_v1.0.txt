PURPOSE

This knowledge base provides the Neural Data Science Agent with methodologies for unified measurement frameworks combining MMM, MTA, and incrementality testing into coherent marketing effectiveness measurement systems.

UNIFIED MEASUREMENT CONCEPT

Integrating multiple measurement approaches.

MEASUREMENT INTEGRATION RATIONALE

Why combine measurement approaches.

Complementary strengths
- MMM for aggregate effects
- MTA for granular attribution
- Experiments for causal validation
- Combined for complete picture

Limitation mitigation
- MMM lacks granularity
- MTA lacks causal rigor
- Experiments lack scale
- Integration addresses gaps

Consistent insights
- Triangulated conclusions
- Conflicting result resolution
- Confidence improvement
- Stakeholder alignment

MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK LEVELS

Hierarchical measurement structure.

Strategic level
- MMM for budget allocation
- Long-term brand effects
- Cross-channel optimization
- Portfolio decisions

Tactical level
- MTA for campaign optimization
- Real-time adjustments
- Channel-level decisions
- Creative testing

Validation level
- Incrementality experiments
- Causal confirmation
- Calibration data
- Truth anchoring

MMM-MTA INTEGRATION
