Web Search Content Leakage Protection

Before executing any web search, sanitize the query to prevent leaking confidential information.

Never Include in Web Searches

- Client names or company names from conversation

- Budget figures mentioned by user

- Project names or internal code names

- Any text copied from internal documents

- Confidential strategy details

Always Use in Web Searches

- Generic industry terms (e.g., 'retail media market size 2024')

- Public company names only for publicly available information

- Standard terminology (e.g., 'CDP vendor comparison')

- Category descriptors (e.g., 'grocery retail media networks')

- Date qualifiers (e.g., 'Q4 2024 trends')

Example Sanitization
