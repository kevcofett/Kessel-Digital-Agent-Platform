Identity Resolution Reference Guide

Version 7.0

Last Updated: December 2024

Document Purpose

This reference document provides comprehensive information on identity resolution platforms for marketing and advertising applications. It covers technical requirements, match rate expectations, coverage, integrations, and pricing models to support vendor evaluation and implementation planning.

Market Overview

Identity resolution has become essential infrastructure for modern marketing as third-party cookies decline and privacy regulations expand. The market consists of deterministic providers using verified PII linkages, probabilistic solutions using statistical matching, and hybrid approaches combining both methodologies. Key trends include the shift toward authenticated traffic, growth of clean room-based identity collaboration, and expansion of identity across CTV and emerging channels.

The identity resolution market is estimated at USD 2.5 billion in 2024, growing at 15-20% annually. Major providers include credit bureau-backed solutions (LiveRamp, TransUnion, Experian), agency-owned platforms (Epsilon/Publicis, Merkle/Dentsu), and open-source frameworks (UID2, ID5). Selection depends on use case requirements, existing technology stack, and activation channel priorities.

Match Rate Fundamentals

Match rates measure the percentage of input records successfully linked to an identity graph. Rates vary significantly based on input identifier type, data quality, matching methodology, and precision level. Email-based matching typically achieves 70-85% for quality data. Phone matching ranges 60-80%. Postal with name reaches 80-95% at household level. MAID matching has declined to 40-60% following Apple ATT implementation. Context matters: vendors may report rates at different precision levels (individual vs household) and using different measurement windows.

Deterministic matching uses explicit identifier linkages (email, phone, login) providing high accuracy but limited scale. Probabilistic matching uses statistical signals (IP, device fingerprint, behavior) providing scale but less precision. Hybrid approaches combine both methodologies to balance accuracy and reach. Industry benchmarks suggest 74-85% overall match rates for quality first-party data across leading providers.

LiveRamp

Overview

LiveRamp is the leading identity resolution platform with the largest identity graph covering over 250 million US consumers and 1 billion globally. The platform translates common identifiers into RampID, a stable pseudonymous key that enables privacy-safe data connectivity across the advertising ecosystem.

RampID serves as the persistent identity key across all activations.

Match Rate Expectations

Email-based matching typically achieves 70-85% match rates for quality first-party data. Phone matching ranges 60-75%. Postal with name achieves 80-90% at household level. MAID matching has declined to 40-60% post-ATT. Cross-device matching averages 2.5 devices per matched individual. Match rates vary based on data quality, recency, and precision level (individual vs household).

Coverage

US coverage exceeds 250 million adults with household-level resolution. Global coverage spans 40+ countries with varying depth. Device graph includes desktop, mobile, tablet, CTV, and emerging connected devices. LiveRamp maintains relationships with 90% of the top 200 US publishers for cookie and device matching.
