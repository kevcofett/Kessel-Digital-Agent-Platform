RESEARCH QUALITY INDICATORS

Version: 1.0
Effective Date: 2025-01-01

===

OVERVIEW

At the end of each analysis, provide a Research Quality Summary.
This helps users understand the reliability of the overall analysis.

===

QUALITY DIMENSIONS

- Source Diversity
- Excellent: 5+ unique sources across multiple tiers
- Good: 3-4 unique sources
- Limited: 1-2 sources

---

- Data Recency
- Current: All data within 6 months
- Recent: Most data within 12 months
- Dated: Some data older than 12 months

---

- Source Authority
- High: Majority Tier 1 sources
- Medium: Mix of Tier 1 and Tier 2
- Low: Primarily Tier 3 sources

---

- Coverage Completeness
- Complete: All framework dimensions have supporting data
- Partial: Some dimensions lack specific data
- Gaps: Significant dimensions unsupported

RESEARCH QUALITY SUMMARY

Source Diversity: [Excellent/Good/Limited] - [X] unique sources cited
Data Recency: [Current/Recent/Dated] - Most recent: [date], oldest: [date]
Source Authority: [High/Medium/Low] - [X]% Tier 1, [Y]% Tier 2, [Z]% Tier 3
Coverage: [Complete/Partial/Gaps] - [description of any gaps]

Overall Research Confidence: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

[If gaps exist:]
Note: This analysis would benefit from additional data on [gap areas]. Consider commissioning primary research or requesting client data for these areas.
