1.1 PURPOSE

This document provides guidance on AI applications in advertising and media planning. As AI increasingly drives campaign optimization, creative generation, and targeting, media planners must understand capabilities, limitations, and oversight requirements.

1.2 KEY AI APPLICATION AREAS

Campaign Optimization:
- Automated bidding and budget allocation
- Audience expansion and targeting
- Placement optimization across inventory
- Real-time performance adjustments

Creative Generation:
- Text generation for ad copy
- Image generation for display and social
- Dynamic creative optimization (DCO)
- Automated creative testing

1.3 IMPLICATIONS FOR MEDIA PLANNING

Advantages:
- Scale optimization beyond human capacity
- Real-time adjustment to performance signals
- Pattern recognition across large datasets

Challenges:
- Reduced transparency into decision-making
- Limited control over targeting and creative
- Difficulty measuring true incremental impact
- Platform incentives may not align with advertiser goals

SECTION 2: BLACK-BOX CAMPAIGN TYPES
================================================================================

META_INTENT: CHANNEL_SELECTION
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH
META_CHUNK_PRIORITY: 1

2.1 META ADVANTAGE PLUS (ASC)

Overview:
- AI-powered campaign type consolidating ad sets and audiences
- Reduces manual targeting controls in favor of algorithmic optimization
- Includes Advantage Plus Shopping Campaigns and App Campaigns

How It Works:
- Advertiser provides creative assets and conversion objective
- Algorithm determines audience targeting dynamically
- Budget allocated automatically across placements

Performance Claims:
- Meta reports 12-20 percent improvement in cost per result
- Gains vary significantly by vertical and advertiser maturity

Planning Considerations:
- Limited audience exclusion capabilities
- Cannot fully separate prospecting from retargeting
- Creative quality becomes primary optimization lever
- Measurement relies on Meta conversion modeling

Best Practices:
- Provide diverse creative assets
- Use cost cap bidding for efficiency guardrails
- Monitor audience overlap with other campaigns
- Validate with incrementality testing

2.2 GOOGLE PERFORMANCE MAX (PMAX)

Overview:
- AI-powered cross-channel campaign across Search, Display, YouTube, Discover, Gmail, Maps
- Uses Asset Groups with creative elements optimized by AI
- Replaced Smart Shopping and Local campaigns

How It Works:
- Advertiser provides assets (images, videos, text) and conversion goals
- AI generates ad combinations from provided assets
- Algorithm optimizes across Google properties automatically

Performance Claims:
- Google reports 18 percent average improvement in conversions at similar CPA
- Results vary significantly by vertical
- Search cannibalization common concern

Planning Considerations:
- Very limited placement and audience transparency
- Difficult to attribute results to specific channels
- May cannibalize branded search traffic

Best Practices:
- Exclude brand keywords through negative keyword lists
- Monitor branded search impression share separately
- Use audience signals as hints rather than targeting
- Maintain parallel standard campaigns for comparison
- Implement incrementality testing before scaling

2.3 AMAZON DSP AUTOMATED CAMPAIGNS

Overview:
- Programmatic buying with algorithmic optimization
- Leverages Amazon first-party purchase data
- Serves across Amazon owned-and-operated plus open web

Planning Considerations:
- Strong lower-funnel performance for retail
- Limited transparency into audience composition
- Consider retail media network alternatives
- Validate incrementality against organic Amazon sales

SECTION 3: AI CAMPAIGN VALIDATION FRAMEWORK
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: ai_validation_framework
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 6,8,9
META_TOPICS: validation, incrementality, testing, measurement
META_INTENT: MEASUREMENT_GUIDANCE
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH
META_CHUNK_PRIORITY: 1

3.1 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS

AI campaigns require additional validation due to reduced transparency:

INCREMENTALITY TESTING:
- Mandatory before scaling AI campaigns significantly
- Geographic holdouts preferred for statistical power
- Compare AI campaign lift to control group
- Typical finding: attributed results exceed incremental by 20-40 percent

CROSS-CHANNEL CANNIBALIZATION:
- Monitor brand search volume and efficiency
- Track organic conversion trends
- Watch for audience overlap indicators
- Measure new-to-brand customer rates

PERFORMANCE SUSTAINABILITY:
- Track efficiency trends over 90+ day windows
- Monitor for learning phase reversion
- Watch creative fatigue indicators
- Assess plateau patterns after initial gains

3.2 VALIDATION CHECKPOINTS

Before Scaling:
- Confirm incremental lift is positive and material
- Verify no significant cannibalization
- Establish efficiency baseline and guardrails

During Campaign:
- Weekly efficiency trend monitoring
- Monthly incrementality refresh if possible
- Quarterly comprehensive review

After Campaign:
- Document validated incremental contribution
- Update planning benchmarks
- Apply learnings to future AI campaign setup

================================================================================
SECTION 4: HUMAN OVERSIGHT REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: human_oversight
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 4,8,9
META_TOPICS: oversight, brand_safety, creative_review, guardrails
META_INTENT: CHANNEL_SELECTION, MEASUREMENT_GUIDANCE
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH

4.1 NON-NEGOTIABLE OVERSIGHT AREAS

Brand Safety:
- Human review of AI-generated creative before launch
- Placement exclusion lists maintained and updated
- Regular audit of actual placements (where visible)

Budget Controls:
- Cost caps or ROAS targets as efficiency guardrails
- Daily budget limits to prevent runaway spend
- Alert thresholds for anomalous performance

Creative Quality:
- Human approval of all AI-generated text and images
- Brand guideline compliance verification
- Legal and regulatory review as needed

4.2 OVERSIGHT FREQUENCY

Daily: Budget pacing, major efficiency shifts
Weekly: Creative performance, placement audit
Monthly: Incrementality indicators, cannibalization check
Quarterly: Comprehensive validation and strategy review

================================================================================
SECTION 5: DECISION GUIDANCE
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: ai_decision_guidance
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 4,5,6
META_TOPICS: decision_framework, when_to_use, recommendations
META_INTENT: CHANNEL_SELECTION
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH
META_CHUNK_PRIORITY: 1

5.1 WHEN TO RECOMMEND AI CAMPAIGNS

Strong Candidates:
- New advertisers without historical optimization baseline
- High volume conversion goals (1000+ per month)
- Diverse creative assets available
- Flexibility on audience composition
- Budget sufficient for learning phase (10K+ per month per platform)

Weak Candidates:
- Highly specific audience requirements
- Limited creative assets
- Need for granular channel attribution
- Strict audience exclusion requirements
- Low conversion volume (under 100 per month)

5.2 SCALING DECISION FRAMEWORK

Scale UP when:
- Incrementality testing confirms positive lift
- Efficiency meets or exceeds targets
- No significant cannibalization detected
- Creative assets remain fresh

Scale DOWN or Pause when:
- Incrementality testing shows minimal lift
- Efficiency declining despite optimization
- Significant cannibalization of other channels
- Creative fatigue evident

5.3 HYBRID APPROACH RECOMMENDATION

For most advertisers, recommend hybrid approach:
- Maintain standard campaigns for transparency and control
- Test AI campaigns with 20-30 percent of budget
- Scale AI allocation based on validated performance
- Never fully abandon controllable campaigns

================================================================================
SECTION 6: FALLBACK AND CROSS-REFERENCES
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: ai_fallbacks_references
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: ALL
META_TOPICS: fallback, cross_references
META_INTENT: WORKFLOW_HELP
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH

6.1 FALLBACK BEHAVIOR

IF incrementality data unavailable:
- Use industry benchmarks for typical AI vs standard lift
- Apply conservative discount (20-30 percent) to attributed results
- Flag need for validation before major scaling

IF creative assets limited:
- Recommend standard campaigns until assets developed
- AI campaigns require diverse assets for optimization
- Suggest creative development as prerequisite

IF channel transparency required:
- AI campaigns may not be appropriate
- Recommend standard campaigns with manual optimization
- Document trade-off between efficiency and visibility
