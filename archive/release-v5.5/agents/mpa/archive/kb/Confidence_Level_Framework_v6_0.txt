SECTION 1: PURPOSE AND CORE PRINCIPLE
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: confidence_purpose
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 6,9
META_TOPICS: purpose, core_principle
META_INTENT: GENERAL
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH

1.1 PURPOSE

This framework defines methodology for assigning and communicating confidence levels for all projections. Every forecast MUST include a confidence level indicator to ensure users understand projection reliability.

1.2 CORE PRINCIPLE

The agent MUST always communicate uncertainty honestly. Overstating confidence erodes trust. Understating confidence creates unnecessary concern. The goal is calibrated accuracy where stated confidence ranges match actual outcome distributions.

================================================================================
SECTION 2: CONFIDENCE LEVEL DEFINITIONS
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: confidence_definitions
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 6,9
META_TOPICS: high_confidence, medium_confidence, low_confidence, ranges
META_INTENT: MEASUREMENT_GUIDANCE
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH
META_CHUNK_PRIORITY: 1

2.1 HIGH CONFIDENCE

Range: Plus or minus 5-10 percent

Characteristics:
- Based on platform-reported data or verified historical performance
- Calculations use known, stable inputs (contracted CPMs, guaranteed rates)
- Market conditions are stable and predictable
- Short forecast horizon (days to weeks)

When to Assign:
- Impressions from confirmed CPM and budget
- Reach from platform-provided audience size
- CPM projections based on contracted rates

2.2 MEDIUM CONFIDENCE

Range: Plus or minus 15-20 percent

Characteristics:
- Based on industry benchmarks or similar campaign data
- Calculations include assumptions about engagement rates
- Market conditions are relatively stable
- Medium forecast horizon (weeks to months)

When to Assign:
- Click projections using benchmark CTRs
- Conversion projections with historical CVR data
- Efficiency metrics with reasonable benchmark basis

2.3 LOW CONFIDENCE

Range: Plus or minus 25-35 percent or higher

Characteristics:
- Based on general industry data or limited benchmarks
- Significant assumptions required
- Market conditions uncertain or volatile
- Long forecast horizon or new market entry

When to Assign:
- Revenue projections without historical data
- New channel performance estimates
- Long-range (3+ month) forecasts
- Novel audience or creative approach

================================================================================
SECTION 3: DATA INPUT SCORING
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: data_input_scoring
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 6
META_TOPICS: data_quality, input_scoring, reliability
META_INTENT: MEASUREMENT_GUIDANCE
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH
META_CHUNK_PRIORITY: 1

3.1 DATA SOURCE HIERARCHY

Tier 1 - Highest Reliability:
- Client's verified historical data (same brand, same market)
- Platform-reported actuals from recent campaigns
- Contracted rates and guarantees

Tier 2 - High Reliability:
- Client's related historical data (similar products/markets)
- Category benchmarks from verified sources
- Platform planning estimates

Tier 3 - Medium Reliability:
- Industry benchmarks from reputable sources
- Analogous brand performance data
- Multi-source averaged benchmarks

Tier 4 - Lower Reliability:
- General category averages
- Extrapolated or modeled estimates
- Single-source benchmarks

3.2 CONFIDENCE SCORING FORMULA

Base confidence starts at MEDIUM.
Adjust based on data inputs:
- All Tier 1 inputs: Upgrade to HIGH
- Mix of Tier 1/2: Stay at MEDIUM
- Heavy Tier 3/4 reliance: Downgrade to LOW
- Missing critical inputs: Downgrade to LOW

================================================================================
SECTION 4: COMMUNICATION STANDARDS
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: communication_standards
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 9,10
META_TOPICS: display_format, ranges, communication
META_INTENT: GENERAL
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH

4.1 DISPLAY FORMAT

Always present projections with:
- Point estimate (most likely outcome)
- Confidence level label (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Range (lower bound - upper bound)

Example Format:
Projected Conversions: 50,000 (MEDIUM CONFIDENCE)
Range: 40,000 - 60,000

4.2 RANGE CALCULATION

HIGH: Point estimate × 0.90 to 1.10
MEDIUM: Point estimate × 0.80 to 1.20
LOW: Point estimate × 0.65 to 1.35

4.3 SCENARIO PRESENTATION

For critical decisions, present three scenarios:
- Conservative (lower bound)
- Base (point estimate)
- Optimistic (upper bound)

================================================================================
SECTION 5: CONFIDENCE IMPROVEMENT PATH
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: confidence_improvement
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 6,9
META_TOPICS: improvement, data_collection, refinement
META_INTENT: MEASUREMENT_GUIDANCE
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH

5.1 UPGRADING FROM LOW TO MEDIUM

Required:
- Obtain category-specific benchmarks
- Validate assumptions against at least 2 sources
- Reduce forecast horizon if possible
- Clarify audience definition

5.2 UPGRADING FROM MEDIUM TO HIGH

Required:
- Obtain client's verified historical data
- Use platform-reported actuals
- Secure contracted rates where applicable
- Shorten forecast horizon to under 4 weeks

5.3 AGENT BEHAVIOR

When confidence is LOW, the agent SHOULD:
- Explicitly state the uncertainty
- Identify what data would improve confidence
- Recommend test-and-learn approach
- Set appropriate expectations
