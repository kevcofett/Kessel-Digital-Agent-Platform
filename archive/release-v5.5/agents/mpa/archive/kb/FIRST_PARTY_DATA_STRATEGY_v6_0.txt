SECTION 1: PURPOSE AND FUNDAMENTALS
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: first_party_purpose
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 2,3
META_TOPICS: purpose, first_party_data, privacy_landscape
META_INTENT: AUDIENCE_TARGETING
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH

1.1 PURPOSE

This document provides guidance on first-party data strategy for media planning. First-party data has become the foundation of effective marketing due to privacy regulations, consumer expectations, and platform signal loss.

1.2 WHAT IS FIRST-PARTY DATA

Information collected directly from customers and prospects through owned touchpoints with consent:
- Website and app interactions
- Purchase and transaction history
- Customer account information
- Email and communication engagement
- Loyalty program participation
- Customer service interactions

1.3 WHY IT MATTERS

Privacy Landscape Context:
- Third-party cookies blocked in Safari/Firefox (~21% of traffic)
- Regulatory requirements (GDPR, CCPA) restrict third-party data
- Consumer privacy expectations continue rising
- Platform signal loss from app tracking transparency

Marketing Effectiveness:
- Deterministic matching to known customers
- Higher accuracy than modeled or probabilistic data
- Better personalization drives improved outcomes
- Foundation for customer lifetime value optimization

1.4 DATA TYPE COMPARISON

First-Party: Collected directly, highest accuracy, requires consent
Zero-Party: Explicitly provided preferences, highest trust indicator
Second-Party: Partner's first-party data shared directly
Third-Party: Aggregated from providers, declining availability

================================================================================
SECTION 2: DATA ACTIVATION STRATEGIES
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: data_activation
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 2,3,4
META_TOPICS: activation, lookalikes, suppression, retargeting
META_INTENT: AUDIENCE_TARGETING
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH
META_CHUNK_PRIORITY: 1

2.1 CUSTOMER MATCH AND LOOKALIKES

High-Value Lookalikes:
- Seed with top 10-20% customers by LTV
- Typically 40-60% better CAC than prospecting
- Update seed audiences quarterly minimum

Broad Lookalikes:
- Seed with all customers or converters
- Good balance of efficiency and scale
- Refresh monthly to capture recent patterns

2.2 AUDIENCE SUPPRESSION

Customer Suppression:
- Exclude existing customers from acquisition campaigns
- Update suppression lists weekly minimum
- Monitor new-to-brand rate as quality check

Recent Purchaser Suppression:
- Exclude recent purchasers from retargeting
- Window depends on purchase cycle (30-90 days typical)
- Prevents wasted spend on already-converted

2.3 RETARGETING SEGMENTS

Site Visitor Retargeting:
- 7-day visitors: highest intent, smaller pool
- 30-day visitors: balance of intent and scale
- 90-day visitors: broader reach, lower intent

Cart Abandoners:
- Highest intent retargeting segment
- Aggressive frequency acceptable (5-10/week)
- Time-decay messaging effective

2.4 LIFECYCLE MARKETING

Onboarding Sequences:
- New customer activation focus
- First 30 days critical for retention
- Cross-sell and education content

Win-Back Campaigns:
- Lapsed customer reactivation
- 90-180 day inactivity trigger typical
- Test offers and messaging
