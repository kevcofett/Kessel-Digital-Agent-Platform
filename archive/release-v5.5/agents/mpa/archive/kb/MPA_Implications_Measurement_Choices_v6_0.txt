1.1 PURPOSE

This document provides comprehensive implication mapping for measurement decisions. The agent MUST consult this document when users propose KPI changes, attribution methodology changes, or measurement framework decisions.

1.2 SCOPE

This document covers implication chains for:
- Primary KPI selection changes
- Attribution window modifications
- Attribution model changes
- Tracking and data collection decisions

================================================================================
SECTION 2: KPI SELECTION IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: kpi_selection_implications
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 3,8
META_TOPICS: kpi_selection, primary_kpi, secondary_kpi
META_INTENT: MEASUREMENT_GUIDANCE
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH
META_CHUNK_PRIORITY: 1

2.1 CHOOSING ROAS AS PRIMARY KPI

Immediate effects:
- Campaigns optimize toward revenue generation
- Lower-funnel channels appear more efficient
- Algorithm prioritizes conversion-likely audiences

Medium-term effects:
- Audience pool may narrow to high-propensity
- Brand building efforts appear wasteful
- Upper-funnel gets deprioritized

Long-term effects:
- Demand generation deficit may emerge
- Customer acquisition costs rise over time
- Brand consideration metrics decline

2.2 CHOOSING CPA AS PRIMARY KPI

Immediate effects:
- Campaigns optimize toward conversion efficiency
- Quality of conversions may not be weighted
- Volume may decline as efficiency increases

Medium-term effects:
- May attract lower-value customers if LTV not weighted
- Conversion volume may plateau
- Efficiency gains may reach limits

Long-term effects:
- Customer quality trends need monitoring
- May need to shift to value-based KPIs
- Growth may stall without volume objectives

2.3 CHOOSING VOLUME (CONVERSIONS) AS PRIMARY KPI

Immediate effects:
- Maximum conversion volume pursued
- Efficiency may decline initially
- Broader audience targeting activated

Medium-term effects:
- Customer acquisition costs may rise
- Quality distribution needs monitoring
- Scale unlocked but efficiency traded

Long-term effects:
- Market share growth possible
- Efficiency can be optimized secondarily
- Customer quality segmentation important

================================================================================
SECTION 3: ATTRIBUTION WINDOW IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: attribution_window_implications
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 8
META_TOPICS: attribution_window, click_window, view_through
META_INTENT: MEASUREMENT_GUIDANCE
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH
META_CHUNK_PRIORITY: 1

3.1 SHORTENING ATTRIBUTION WINDOW

Immediate effects:
- Reported conversions decrease
- ROAS appears to decline
- Lower-funnel channels less affected

Medium-term effects:
- More conservative measurement baseline
- Upper-funnel contribution appears lower
- Cleaner incrementality signal

Long-term effects:
- Reallocation may favor lower-funnel
- Brand investment harder to justify
- Measurement aligns with incrementality

3.2 LENGTHENING ATTRIBUTION WINDOW

Immediate effects:
- Reported conversions increase
- ROAS appears to improve
- All channels show higher attributed volume

Medium-term effects:
- Organic conversions included in attribution
- True incremental impact obscured
- Cross-channel overlap increases

Long-term effects:
- May overinvest based on inflated metrics
- Incrementality testing becomes more critical
- Platform incentives reinforced

3.3 ADDING VIEW-THROUGH ATTRIBUTION

Immediate effects:
- Significant increase in attributed conversions
- Display and video channels appear more efficient
- ROAS metrics improve substantially

Medium-term effects:
- Attribution includes many organic conversions
- Incrementality rate typically 20-40 percent
- Channel comparison distorted

Better approach:
- Use view-through only with incrementality validation
- Apply discount factor to view-through conversions
- Consider removing if incrementality not validated

================================================================================
SECTION 4: ATTRIBUTION MODEL IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: attribution_model_implications
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 8
META_TOPICS: last_click, multi_touch, data_driven, mmm
META_INTENT: MEASUREMENT_GUIDANCE
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH

4.1 SWITCHING FROM LAST-CLICK TO MULTI-TOUCH

Immediate effects:
- Credit redistributes across touchpoints
- Lower-funnel channels lose apparent efficiency
- Upper-funnel channels gain credit

Medium-term effects:
- Budget allocation decisions change
- Channel comparison more balanced
- Attribution model assumptions affect results

Long-term effects:
- Investment in upper-funnel may increase
- Need to validate with incrementality
- Model assumptions require monitoring

4.2 SWITCHING TO DATA-DRIVEN ATTRIBUTION

Immediate effects:
- Algorithm determines credit distribution
- Results may differ significantly from rules-based
- Transparency into credit assignment decreases

Medium-term effects:
- Model learns from conversion patterns
- May favor channels that touch most journeys
- Difficult to explain to stakeholders

Long-term effects:
- Requires ongoing validation
- Platform-specific models favor platform
- Cross-platform comparison challenging
