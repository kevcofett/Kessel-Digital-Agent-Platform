1.1 PURPOSE

This document provides implication mapping for timing and pacing decisions. The agent MUST consult this document when users define campaign timing, pacing strategies, or flight schedules.

1.2 SCOPE

This document covers implication chains for:
- Campaign flight timing decisions
- Pacing strategy selection
- Seasonal and event-based timing
- Always-on versus flighting strategies

================================================================================
SECTION 2: FLIGHT TIMING IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: flight_timing_implications
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 5,7
META_TOPICS: flight_length, learning_phase, campaign_duration
META_INTENT: BUDGET_PLANNING
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH
META_CHUNK_PRIORITY: 1

2.1 SHORT FLIGHTS (1-4 WEEKS)

- Week 1: Learning phase consumes significant portion
- Week 2-3: Optimization limited by insufficient data
- Week 4: Performance stabilizes just as flight ends
- Post-flight: Measurement window too short for accurate attribution
- Long-term: Brand impact minimal, momentum lost between flights

2.2 MEDIUM FLIGHTS (5-8 WEEKS)

- Week 1-2: Learning phase completes for most channels
- Week 3-4: Optimization adjustments possible with data
- Week 5-6: Performance reaches steady state
- Week 7-8: Creative fatigue may emerge
- Post-flight: Sufficient data for performance analysis

2.3 LONG FLIGHTS (9+ WEEKS)

- Week 1-2: Learning phase completes
- Week 3-6: Multiple optimization cycles possible
- Week 7-9: Creative refresh likely required
- Week 10+: Audience fatigue and frequency caps critical
- Long-term: Brand awareness builds cumulatively

2.4 DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS

- Does the flight length allow sufficient learning phase
- What creative refresh strategy exists for longer flights
- How will success be measured at flight conclusion

================================================================================
SECTION 3: PACING STRATEGY IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: pacing_strategy_implications
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 5,7
META_TOPICS: pacing, front_loaded, back_loaded, even_pacing, pulse
META_INTENT: BUDGET_PLANNING
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH
META_CHUNK_PRIORITY: 1

3.1 FRONT-LOADED PACING

- Week 1-2: Maximum reach during high-priority period
- Week 3-4: Creative fatigue accelerates
- Week 5-6: Audience exhaustion risk increases
- Week 7-8: Limited budget remaining for optimization
- Long-term: Momentum advantage but flexibility sacrificed

3.2 BACK-LOADED PACING

- Week 1-2: Lower reach and frequency during opening
- Week 3-4: Competitors may gain advantage early
- Week 5-6: Learning phase data informs later optimization
- Week 7-8: Maximum investment with optimization insights
- Long-term: Risk of under-delivery if channels cannot absorb surge

3.3 EVEN PACING

- Week 1-2: Consistent reach from campaign start
- Week 3-4: Predictable frequency builds
- Week 5-6: Steady optimization possible throughout
- Week 7-8: Balanced performance throughout flight
- Long-term: No peak impact but sustained presence

3.4 PULSE PACING

- High-burst periods: Reaches awareness threshold quickly
- Low/off periods: Allows creative refresh, reduces fatigue
- Pattern: Typical 2 weeks on, 1 week off cycle
- Best for: Seasonal products, limited budgets, brand awareness

================================================================================
SECTION 4: SEASONAL TIMING IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: seasonal_implications
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 5,7
META_TOPICS: seasonality, q4, holiday, competitive_periods
META_INTENT: BUDGET_PLANNING
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH

4.1 PEAK SEASON IMPLICATIONS (Q4, HOLIDAYS)

- CPMs typically increase 20-40% in Q4
- Competitive clutter reduces message retention
- Customer intent higher but acquisition more expensive
- Requires earlier creative development for approval queues

4.2 OFF-PEAK IMPLICATIONS

- Lower CPMs improve efficiency
- Less competitive clutter
- Customer intent may be lower
- Good for brand building and testing

4.3 COUNTER-CYCLICAL STRATEGY

When advertising heavily during competitor light periods:
- Share of voice advantage at lower cost
- Build brand awareness when clutter is reduced
- Requires patience for delayed conversion impact
- Best for brands with longer consideration cycles
