VERSION 5.8
DATE January 2026
STATUS Production Ready
DOCUMENT TYPE Knowledge Base - Step 3 Audience Validation
COMPLIANCE 6-Rule Compliant

OVERVIEW

This document defines the mandatory requirements for complete audience definition in Step 3. The agent MUST verify all four dimensions are addressed and signal count thresholds are met before proceeding to Step 4 Geography.

CORE PRINCIPLE

Incomplete audience definition leads to wasted media spend. Every audience specification must cover four dimensions with sufficient signals for the campaign type. Census-validated sizing and platform taxonomy codes are required for activation-ready outputs.

FOUR DIMENSION REQUIREMENT

The agent MUST verify coverage across all four dimensions before completing Step 3.

DIMENSION 1 DEMOGRAPHIC

Required signals:
- Age range with specific bounds
- Gender if relevant
- Household income tier
- Education level if relevant
- Homeownership status if relevant
- Presence of children if relevant
- Life stage indicators

DIMENSION 2 BEHAVIORAL

Required signals:
- In-market purchase intent categories
- Content consumption patterns
- Past purchase history indicators
- Site visitation behavior
- App usage patterns
- Search behavior indicators
- Engagement patterns

DIMENSION 3 CONTEXTUAL

Required signals:
- Daypart targeting preferences
- Device targeting requirements
- Content category alignment
- Weather-based triggers if applicable
- Seasonal patterns
- Event-based triggers

DIMENSION 4 GEOGRAPHIC

Required signals:
- Country or countries
- Region or state level
- DMA or market level
- Urban versus suburban versus rural
- Language preferences by geography

SIGNAL COUNT THRESHOLDS

Brand Awareness Campaigns: 5-10 signals total
Performance Campaigns: 20-40 signals total
Consideration Campaigns: 10-20 signals total

The agent must count signals across all four dimensions and verify the total meets threshold for campaign type.

CENSUS DATA REQUIREMENTS

The agent MUST search for current census and population data when defining audience sizing. This is not optional.

DATA SOURCES BY COUNTRY

United States
- Primary: US Census Bureau American Community Survey
- Search: site:census.gov [demographic] [DMA] population
- Tables: B01003 Total Population, B03002 Hispanic Origin, B19001 Income, S0101 Age

Canada
- Primary: Statistics Canada
- Search: site:statcan.gc.ca [CMA] population [demographic]

United Kingdom
- Primary: Office for National Statistics
- Search: site:ons.gov.uk [region] population [demographic]

European Union
- Primary: Eurostat plus national offices
- Search: site:ec.europa.eu/eurostat [country] [demographic]

Australia
- Primary: Australian Bureau of Statistics
- Search: site:abs.gov.au [state] population [demographic]

CITATION REQUIREMENTS

Every audience size estimate must cite:
- Source name and organization
- Geographic level of data
- Data year or range
- Specific table reference if applicable

AUDIENCE INTERSECTION METHODOLOGY

Step 1 - Get total population from census
Step 2 - Apply demographic filters as percentage reductions
Step 3 - Apply behavioral filters as percentage reductions
Step 4 - Result is estimated addressable audience

Example calculation:
- LA DMA total: 13,200,000 (Census ACS 2019-2023)
- Age 25-54: 40% = 5,280,000
- HHI over 50K: 45% = 2,376,000
- Hispanic origin: 45% = 1,069,200
- In-market financial: 6% = 64,152
- Target audience: 64,152 (0.5% of DMA)

TAXONOMY CODE REQUIREMENTS

The agent MUST produce platform-specific codes for activation. Web search for current codes rather than relying on potentially outdated information.

IAB CONTENT TAXONOMY OUTPUT FORMAT

Tier 1: IAB-[number] [Category Name]
Tier 2: IAB-[number]-[number] [Subcategory Name]
Example: IAB13 Personal Finance, IAB13-7 Investing

Search pattern: IAB content taxonomy [category] code number

GOOGLE AUDIENCE OUTPUT FORMAT

Affinity: /Affinity/[Category]/[Subcategory]
In-Market: /In-Market/[Category]/[Subcategory]
Custom Intent: Keywords + URLs

Search pattern: Google Ads [affinity/in-market] audience [category] list

META TARGETING OUTPUT FORMAT

Interests: [Interest1], [Interest2]
Behaviors: [Behavior1], [Behavior2]
Demographics: [Demo1], [Demo2]

Search pattern: Facebook detailed targeting [interest] options

LINKEDIN TARGETING OUTPUT FORMAT

Job Titles: [Title1], [Title2]
Job Functions: [Function1], [Function2]
Industries: [Industry1], [Industry2]
Company Size: [Size range]
Seniority: [Level1], [Level2]

Search pattern: LinkedIn Campaign Manager targeting [attribute] options

WEB SEARCH REQUIREMENTS

The agent MUST search for current taxonomy codes before presenting audience specification. Do not assume codes are correct without verification.

Search triggers:
- Any audience definition requiring platform targeting
- Any request for activation-ready specifications
- Any uncertainty about current taxonomy codes

AUDIENCE SPECIFICATION OUTPUT FORMAT

When Step 3 is complete, present the following summary:

Target Description: 2-3 sentences describing the ideal customer

Demographic Profile:
- Signal 1: Value
- Signal 2: Value

Behavioral Profile:
- Signal 1: Value
- Signal 2: Value

Contextual Profile:
- Signal 1: Value
- Signal 2: Value

Geographic Footprint:
| Market | Population | Target Size | Target Pct |
| DMA 1 | X | Y | Z% |
| DMA 2 | X | Y | Z% |
| TOTAL | X | Y | Z% |

Platform Targeting Codes:
- IAB: [codes]
- Google Affinity: [codes]
- Google In-Market: [codes]
- Meta Interests: [interests]
- Meta Behaviors: [behaviors]

Data Sources:
- Census source and year for population
- Demographic data source
- Behavioral methodology

Signal Count: X signals (threshold met for [campaign type])

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

- Presenting audience sizes without census validation
- Omitting taxonomy codes that enable direct activation
- Using outdated population data when current census available
- Defining only demographic signals without behavioral
- Missing geographic dimension entirely
- Not showing calculation methodology
- Failing to verify signal count meets threshold

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before completing Step 3, verify:
- All four dimensions have at least one signal
- Signal count meets threshold for campaign type
- Population data cites census source
- Calculation methodology is shown
- Taxonomy codes are included
- Geographic scope is defined
