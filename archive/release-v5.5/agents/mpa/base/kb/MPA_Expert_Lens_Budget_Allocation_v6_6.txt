MPA EXPERT LENS: BUDGET ALLOCATION v6.6

PURPOSE

This document provides expert-level guidance for budget allocation decisions with v6.6 mandatory response patterns and ADIS segment integration. Use this document for Step 5 Budget Planning and whenever discussing budget efficiency.

V6.6 BUDGET RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS

Every budget discussion MUST include:

1. CONTEXT CALLBACK: Reference known budget and targets
2. CALCULATION: Show the math (budget divided by target)
3. KB BENCHMARK: Cite vertical-specific efficiency benchmarks
4. TARGET LABEL: State if REALISTIC, CONSERVATIVE, AGGRESSIVE, or VERY AGGRESSIVE
5. ADIS OFFER: If customer data mentioned, offer segment-level allocation

BUDGET EFFICIENCY RESPONSE PATTERN

When user provides budget and target:

STEP 1: Calculate implied efficiency
[Budget] divided by [target] equals [implied CAC/CPA]

STEP 2: Compare to KB benchmark
Based on KB data for [vertical], typical [metric] runs [range].

STEP 3: Label the target
Your [implied value] is [LABEL] relative to benchmarks.

STEP 4: Explain implications
[What this means for execution requirements]

EXAMPLE BUDGET RESPONSES

EXAMPLE 1: REALISTIC TARGET

USER: We have 300K to acquire 4000 customers for our DTC skincare brand.

RESPONSE:
With your 300K budget and 4000 customer target for DTC skincare, that implies 75 per customer. Based on KB data for DTC beauty, typical CAC runs 45 to 80. Your 75 target is REALISTIC - toward the upper end but achievable with solid execution.

At this efficiency, I recommend focusing on 3-4 channels maximum to ensure each receives minimum investment for optimization. Do you have customer data? ADIS can identify your highest-value segments for targeting.

EXAMPLE 2: AGGRESSIVE TARGET

USER: Budget is 200K and we need 8000 new subscribers for our meal kit service.

RESPONSE:
With your 200K budget and 8000 subscriber target for meal kit subscription, that implies 25 per customer. Based on KB data for subscription food services, typical CAC runs 60 to 120. Your 25 target is VERY AGGRESSIVE - less than half the typical floor.

To hit 25 CAC, you would need: referral program contributing 30%+ of volume, exceptional organic social performance, or partnership deals with cost-sharing. Which of these do you have in place?

EXAMPLE 3: CONSERVATIVE TARGET

USER: We have 1M budget for 2000 enterprise software demos.

RESPONSE:
With your 1M budget and 2000 demo target for enterprise software, that implies 500 per demo. Based on KB data for B2B enterprise software, typical cost per qualified demo runs 800 to 2000. Your 500 target is CONSERVATIVE - well below typical range.

This gives you significant buffer for testing and learning. You could likely generate 1250-2500 demos at typical rates with this budget. Want to increase your volume target or use the buffer for channel experimentation?

ADIS SEGMENT BUDGET ALLOCATION

When user has ADIS segments, offer AMMO optimization:

AMMO PROMPT:
With your ADIS segments and [budget] budget, I can optimize allocation using AMMO - Audience-Aware Media Mix Optimization. This allocates budget based on segment value, size, and channel affinity. Want me to run the optimization?

SEGMENT ALLOCATION FRAMEWORK

Champions (high value, engaged):
- Allocation: 15-25% of budget
- Focus: Retention, upsell, loyalty programs
- Channels: Email, direct mail, exclusive offers
- Rationale: Protect and grow highest-value customers

Loyal Customers (consistent, reliable):
- Allocation: 20-30% of budget
- Focus: Retention, frequency increase
- Channels: Email, social, content marketing
- Rationale: Maintain engagement, prevent migration to At Risk

At Risk (previously valuable, declining):
- Allocation: 15-25% of budget
- Focus: Reactivation, win-back
- Channels: Retargeting, email win-back, special offers
- Rationale: Recover value before they become Lost

New Customer Acquisition:
- Allocation: 30-40% of budget
- Focus: Growth, lookalike targeting
- Channels: Paid social, search, display prospecting
- Rationale: Expand base using Champions as seed audience

AMMO RESULTS PRESENTATION

With your [budget] allocated across ADIS segments:

Champions (X customers, Y% of value):
- Budget: [amount] ([%])
- Expected outcome: Retention rate improvement, AOV increase
- Based on KB data for [vertical], segment-focused retention campaigns show 15-25% lift

Loyal Customers (X customers, Y% of value):
- Budget: [amount] ([%])
- Expected outcome: Frequency increase, cross-sell
- Based on KB data for [vertical], loyalty campaigns show 10-20% frequency lift

At Risk (X customers, Y% of value):
- Budget: [amount] ([%])
- Expected outcome: [Z]% reactivation rate
- Based on KB data for [vertical], win-back campaigns reactivate 8-15% of At Risk segment

New Acquisition:
- Budget: [amount] ([%])
- Expected outcome: [Z] new customers at [CAC]
- Based on KB data for [vertical], lookalike targeting from Champions reduces CAC 15-25%

FIVE CRITICAL BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS

CONSIDERATION 1: GOAL ALIGNMENT
Budget MUST be mathematically consistent with objectives. Calculate implied efficiency and compare to KB benchmarks. If misaligned, either goal must adjust or budget must increase.

CONSIDERATION 2: CHANNEL SUFFICIENCY
Each channel needs minimum investment for optimization. Better to fund 3 channels well than 6 channels poorly. Based on KB data, minimum viable monthly spend per channel is typically 3-5K for digital, 10-15K for programmatic, 25-50K for linear TV.

CONSIDERATION 3: FUNNEL BALANCE
Allocate minimum 30-40% to upper and mid funnel for sustainable growth. Lower funnel harvests demand created by upper funnel. All lower-funnel allocation depletes demand pool over time.

CONSIDERATION 4: TIMING AND PACING
Front-loaded budgets generate data faster but risk waste before optimization. Back-loaded budgets optimize better but may miss market timing. Consider 30-40-30 pacing for typical quarterly campaigns.

CONSIDERATION 5: FLEXIBILITY RESERVES
Reserve 10-15% for optimization shifts and unexpected opportunities. Rigid budgets cannot respond to performance signals.

COMMON PITFALLS

PITFALL 1: SPREADING TOO THIN
Signal: Budget divided across 6+ channels with small allocations
Fix: Prioritize 2-4 channels, fund each above minimum threshold

PITFALL 2: ALL LOWER FUNNEL
Signal: 80%+ budget in search, retargeting, retail media
Fix: Allocate minimum 30-40% to upper and mid funnel

PITFALL 3: IGNORING MINIMUMS
Signal: Channel allocations below platform learning thresholds
Fix: Cut channels rather than underfund all

PITFALL 4: NO FLEXIBILITY RESERVE
Signal: 100% of budget committed to specific channels
Fix: Reserve 10-15% for optimization

KB BENCHMARK REFERENCE

Based on KB data, typical CAC by vertical:

Ecommerce DTC: 35 to 80
Subscription Services: 60 to 120
B2B Software (SMB): 200 to 500
B2B Software (Enterprise): 2000 to 8000
Fintech Consumer: 75 to 150
Fintech B2B: 500 to 2000
Retail: 15 to 40
CPG: 8 to 25
Healthcare: 100 to 300
