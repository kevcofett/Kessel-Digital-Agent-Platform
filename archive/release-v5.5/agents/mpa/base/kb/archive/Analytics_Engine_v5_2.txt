MPA ANALYTICS ENGINE REFERENCE

VERSION 5.2

OVERVIEW

The Analytics Engine provides data-driven intelligence for media planning decisions. It combines benchmark data, audience insights, and optimization frameworks to inform budget allocation, channel selection, and performance expectations.

PRIMARY COMPONENTS

BENCHMARK DATA SYSTEM

The benchmark system provides industry-standard performance expectations by channel, vertical, and objective. Benchmarks inform realistic goal-setting and variance analysis.

Sources include:

- mpa_benchmark table containing 708 records across verticals and channels
- mpa_channel_seed containing channel characteristics and typical performance
- mpa_kpi_seed containing objective-specific metrics and targets
- mpa_vertical_seed containing industry-specific considerations

Benchmark retrieval follows this priority:

1. Exact match on vertical plus channel plus objective
2. Vertical plus channel match with objective defaults
3. Channel-level defaults with vertical adjustment factors
4. Global defaults as fallback

AUDIENCE DATA INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM

ADIS enables customer data analysis and audience-informed planning. When users upload customer data the system provides:

File Processing:
- Accepts Excel CSV Word PDF PowerPoint files up to 250MB
- Detects column semantics including customer identifiers dates monetary values
- Infers RFM suitability based on available columns
- Stores normalized records for analysis

Analytical Models:

RFM SEGMENTATION produces 11 named segments based on purchasing behavior:
- Champions representing best customers with highest scores
- Loyal Customers with consistent engagement
- Potential Loyalists showing growth opportunity
- New Customers requiring development
- At Risk customers showing decline
- Cannot Lose Them requiring intervention
- Hibernating customers with dormant status
- Lost customers with minimal current value

DECILE ANALYSIS stratifies customers into 10 value tiers revealing concentration patterns.

COHORT ANALYSIS tracks retention by acquisition period identifying lifecycle patterns.

DETERMINISTIC CLV calculates projected customer value using AOV frequency lifespan and margin.

PROBABILISTIC CLV uses BG-NBD model for statistically rigorous lifetime value prediction.

K-MEANS CLUSTERING discovers behavioral segments from numeric features.

Audience Creation:

After analysis users create targetable audiences by:
- Selecting segments from model outputs
- Applying rule-based filters with 12 operators
- Receiving automatic channel recommendations based on segment affinity
- Receiving use case suggestions matching audience characteristics

AMMO FRAMEWORK

Audience-Aware Media Mix Optimization connects audiences to budget allocation. AMMO provides:

Channel Affinity Scoring:
- Each segment has effectiveness indices by channel
- Champions show elevated email and direct mail response
- At Risk segments respond to personalized retargeting
- Lost segments should be suppressed from most channels

Budget Optimization:
- Accepts total budget and audience definitions
- Applies affinity-adjusted response rates
- Optimizes allocation across channels subject to constraints
- Produces expected conversions revenue and ROI by channel

Scenario Analysis:
- Runs conservative moderate aggressive budget scenarios
- Calculates marginal returns between scenarios
- Recommends optimal scenario based on efficiency

INTEGRATION WITH MEDIA PLANNING WORKFLOW

STEP 2 OBJECTIVES

Analytics Engine provides objective-aligned benchmarks. When user selects awareness consideration or conversion objectives the system retrieves appropriate performance expectations by channel.

STEP 4 AUDIENCE

If ADIS data exists recommend audience-informed targeting. The agent should check for uploaded customer data and offer segmentation analysis. Without ADIS data use demographic and behavioral targeting guidance from knowledge base.

STEP 5 BUDGET

AMMO optimization produces budget allocation recommendations when audiences are defined. The agent should:
- Check for ADIS audiences in session
- Offer to run AMMO optimization
- Present allocation recommendations with expected performance
- Compare to current allocation if provided

STEP 7 CHANNELS

Channel affinity from ADIS informs selection. The agent should:
- Reference segment-specific channel effectiveness
- Prioritize channels with high affinity for target audiences
- Note channels to avoid for specific segments
- Adjust reach and frequency based on audience responsiveness

STEP 10 MEASUREMENT

AMMO projections establish measurement benchmarks. The agent should:
- Reference expected performance from optimization
- Set success thresholds based on projections
- Plan for performance attribution back to ADIS
- Enable learning loop through performance import

DATA FLOW

Standard Flow Without Customer Data:

User provides brief details
Agent retrieves benchmarks from mpa_benchmark
Agent applies vertical and objective adjustments
Agent provides planning recommendations

Enhanced Flow With Customer Data:

User uploads customer file
ADIS parses and detects schema
User selects analysis model
ADIS produces segmented outputs
User creates audiences from outputs
AMMO optimizes budget allocation
Agent incorporates into media plan
User imports actual performance
ADIS updates affinity scores

BENCHMARK RETRIEVAL LOGIC

When retrieving benchmarks the engine applies this logic:

For CPM benchmarks:
- Start with channel base CPM
- Apply vertical multiplier if above or below average cost vertical
- Apply seasonality factor if timing specified
- Apply competitive intensity factor if category provided

For Response Rate benchmarks:
- Start with channel base response rate
- Apply objective multiplier for awareness versus conversion
- Apply audience quality factor if ADIS data exists
- Apply creative quality estimate if format specified

For ROI benchmarks:
- Calculate from CPM and response rate
- Apply margin assumptions from vertical data
- Apply customer value from ADIS if available

VERTICAL ADJUSTMENTS

Each vertical has characteristic adjustments:

CPG Fast Moving Consumer Goods:
- Higher media costs due to competitive intensity
- Lower response rates requiring frequency
- Moderate margins with volume focus

Technology:
- Variable costs by segment B2B versus B2C
- Higher response rates for targeted campaigns
- Strong digital channel performance

Financial Services:
- Regulated messaging requirements
- Lower response rates with higher qualification
- High customer lifetime value

Healthcare:
- Compliance constraints on messaging
- Trust-building requires frequency
- Long consideration cycles

Retail:
- Seasonal cost variations
- Promotional response sensitivity
- Transaction-focused measurement

CHANNEL CHARACTERISTICS

Each channel has baseline characteristics:

EMAIL
- CPM range 0.25 to 1.00
- Response rate 2.0 percent base
- Decay rate 0.1 indicating sustained effectiveness
- Best for retention and personalization

PAID SEARCH
- CPM range 15 to 45
- Response rate 3.5 percent base
- Decay rate 0.05 indicating sustained effectiveness
- Best for intent capture and conversion

- Response rate 0.8 percent base
- Decay rate 0.6 indicating faster wear-out
- Best for premium brand building

LINEAR TV
- CPM range 10 to 25
- Response rate 0.5 percent base

OPTIMIZATION CONSTRAINTS

AMMO respects these default constraints:

Minimum allocations:
- Email 5 percent if in consideration set
- Paid Search 10 percent for conversion objectives
- No channel required below 5 percent

Maximum allocations:
- No single channel above 50 percent without explicit override
- Premium channels CTV Direct Mail capped at 25 percent default
- Mass channels capped at 40 percent without reach justification

Budget thresholds:
- Below 50K focus on 2 to 3 channels maximum
- 50K to 250K support 3 to 5 channel mix
- 250K to 1M support full channel consideration
- Above 1M enable premium and experimental channels

ERROR HANDLING

When benchmark data is unavailable:
- Log the gap for future data collection
- Apply conservative defaults
- Inform user of uncertainty in estimates
- Suggest data sources for refinement

When ADIS analysis fails:
- Explain specific requirements not met
- Suggest alternative analyses if applicable
- Proceed with benchmark-based planning
- Note opportunity for future ADIS integration

When optimization fails:
- Check constraint feasibility
- Relax constraints if necessary
- Fall back to proportional allocation
- Document limitations in recommendations
