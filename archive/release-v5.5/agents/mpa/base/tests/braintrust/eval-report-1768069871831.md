## Issues Identified

### HIGH: Agent not acknowledging user answers before proceeding

**Current Behavior:** Agent jumps to new questions without acknowledging what the user just told them, making conversation feel disconnected

**Suggested Fix:**
```
Always start your response by briefly acknowledging what the user just shared (e.g., 'Got it, you generate revenue from both fees and interchange.' or 'Perfect, so you want $2,100 per customer in 90 days.')
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 2 - Revenue Model Question, Step 2 - Remittance Volume Target

---

### HIGH: Agent performing calculations instead of asking for missing data

**Current Behavior:** When user provides volume targets, agent asks for CAC instead of calculating implied CAC from available budget and volume data

**Suggested Fix:**
```
When you have budget and volume targets, immediately calculate the implied CAC (budget ÷ target customers) and present it for validation rather than asking the user to provide CAC separately
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 2 - Remittance Volume Target

---

### HIGH: Agent not matching expected greeting and area naming behavior

**Current Behavior:** Agent provides complex strategic options instead of warm greeting and naming the 10 key areas to be covered

**Suggested Fix:**
```
For initial briefs, start with a warm greeting, briefly name the 10 key areas you'll cover (audience, channels, budget allocation, etc.), then ask ONE specific question about their primary KPI or volume target
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 1 - Initial Brief (Uniteller)

---

### HIGH: Agent providing multiple choice options instead of single focused questions

**Current Behavior:** Agent presents 2-3 options or complex either/or scenarios instead of asking one direct question

**Suggested Fix:**
```
Ask only ONE direct question at a time. Avoid presenting multiple options or either/or scenarios. Make it a simple, direct question that moves the conversation forward
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 1 - Initial Brief (Uniteller), Step 2 - Revenue Model Question

---

### MEDIUM: Agent not citing benchmark sources when making data claims

**Current Behavior:** Agent makes assessments about feasibility or industry standards without citing specific benchmark sources

**Suggested Fix:**
```
When making any claim about industry benchmarks, CAC feasibility, or performance standards, always cite a specific source (e.g., 'According to Forrester 2023 data...' or 'Industry benchmarks from eMarketer show...')
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 2 - Remittance Volume Target

---

### MEDIUM: Agent using complex terminology with basic sophistication users

**Current Behavior:** Agent uses terms like 'unit economics', 'customer lifetime value', and 'budget allocation approach' with basic-level users

**Suggested Fix:**
```
Match language complexity to user sophistication level. For 'basic' users, use simple terms like 'cost per customer' instead of 'CAC', 'revenue per customer' instead of 'unit economics'
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 1 - Initial Brief (Uniteller), Step 2 - Remittance Volume Target
