## Issues Identified

### HIGH: Agent not acknowledging user answers before proceeding

**Current Behavior:** Agent jumps to new questions without acknowledging the user's previous response, making conversations feel disconnected

**Suggested Fix:**
```
Always start your response by briefly acknowledging what the user just told you (e.g., 'Got it, you earn from both fees and interchange.' or 'Perfect, $2,100 per customer in 90 days.'). Then proceed with your next question or analysis.
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 2 - Revenue Model Question, Step 2 - Remittance Volume Target

---

### HIGH: Agent asking multiple questions instead of one focused question

**Current Behavior:** Agent presents multiple options or sub-questions within a single response, violating the 'one question at a time' rule

**Suggested Fix:**
```
Ask exactly ONE question per response. If you need to provide context or options, present them as background information leading to a single, clear question. Avoid bullet points with multiple choices - instead ask for the most critical piece of information first.
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 1 - Initial Brief (Uniteller), Step 2 - Revenue Model Question

---

### HIGH: Agent not performing calculations when sufficient data is provided

**Current Behavior:** When users provide volume and revenue targets, agent asks for more information instead of calculating implied CAC and revenue figures

**Suggested Fix:**
```
When you have volume/revenue data, immediately calculate the implied economics. For remittance businesses, assume 2-3% take rate to calculate revenue from volume. Show your math: 'At $2,100 remittance volume with ~2.5% take rate, that's $52.50 revenue per customer in 90 days.'
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 2 - Remittance Volume Target

---

### MEDIUM: Agent not citing benchmark sources for industry data

**Current Behavior:** Agent makes assumptions about take rates and industry metrics without citing sources

**Suggested Fix:**
```
When referencing industry benchmarks (like remittance take rates, CAC benchmarks, etc.), cite your source. Example: 'According to World Bank data, remittance providers typically charge 2-4% fees' or 'Fintech CAC benchmarks from CB Insights show...'
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 2 - Remittance Volume Target

---

### HIGH: Agent responses exceeding 75-word limit

**Current Behavior:** Responses are too lengthy and verbose, making them harder to digest

**Suggested Fix:**
```
Strictly limit responses to 75 words maximum. Count words before responding. Use concise language and focus on the single most important question or insight. Remove unnecessary explanatory text.
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 1 - Initial Brief (Uniteller), Step 2 - Revenue Model Question, Step 2 - Remittance Volume Target

---

### MEDIUM: Agent not maintaining forward momentum

**Current Behavior:** Agent asks for additional clarification instead of making reasonable assumptions and moving forward with modeling

**Suggested Fix:**
```
When you have core data points, make reasonable industry assumptions and move forward. State your assumptions clearly: 'I'll assume a 2.5% take rate for modeling - we can adjust later.' Prioritize progress over perfect information.
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 2 - Remittance Volume Target
