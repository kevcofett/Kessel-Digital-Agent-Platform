## Issues Identified

### HIGH: Agent not acknowledging user answers before proceeding

**Current Behavior:** Agent jumps to new questions without acknowledging the user's previous response, making conversation feel disconnected

**Suggested Fix:**
```
Add rule: 'Always acknowledge the user's answer with a brief confirmation (e.g., "Got it" or "Perfect") before asking your next question. This shows you're listening and builds rapport.'
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 2 - Revenue Model Question

---

### HIGH: Agent asking multiple questions instead of one

**Current Behavior:** Agent presents multiple options or sub-questions within a single response, violating the one-question rule

**Suggested Fix:**
```
Strengthen the single question rule: 'Ask exactly ONE question per response. If you need to choose between multiple possible questions, pick the most fundamental one that unlocks the most information for media planning.'
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 1 - Initial Brief (Uniteller), Step 2 - Revenue Model Question

---

### HIGH: Agent not performing required calculations when data is available

**Current Behavior:** Agent asks for additional data instead of calculating implied metrics from information already provided

**Suggested Fix:**
```
Add calculation trigger: 'When you have volume/revenue targets, immediately calculate the implied revenue per customer and assess if typical CAC benchmarks (5-20% of customer value) make the campaign feasible. Show your math.'
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 2 - Remittance Volume Target

---

### MEDIUM: Agent not citing benchmark sources for feasibility assessments

**Current Behavior:** Agent makes claims about industry standards or feasibility without providing source attribution

**Suggested Fix:**
```
Add sourcing requirement: 'When referencing industry benchmarks, CAC ratios, or performance standards, cite the source (e.g., "According to Blended Metrics, typical fintech CAC is..."). If you don't have a specific source, state "Based on general industry patterns..."'
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 2 - Remittance Volume Target

---

### MEDIUM: Agent exceeding 75-word limit

**Current Behavior:** Responses are too lengthy and detailed, violating the conciseness requirement

**Suggested Fix:**
```
Add word count enforcement: 'Keep ALL responses under 75 words. Count your words before responding. If over limit, cut explanatory text and focus only on the essential acknowledgment + single question.'
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 1 - Initial Brief (Uniteller), Step 2 - Revenue Model Question

---

### MEDIUM: Agent not matching user sophistication level

**Current Behavior:** Agent uses complex terminology and concepts when user sophistication is marked as 'basic'

**Suggested Fix:**
```
Add sophistication matching: 'For basic users: avoid terms like "customer acquisition cost", "unit economics", "lifetime value". Use simple language like "cost to get each customer" and "how much each customer is worth". For moderate users: some business terms OK but explain briefly.'
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 1 - Initial Brief (Uniteller), Step 2 - Remittance Volume Target
