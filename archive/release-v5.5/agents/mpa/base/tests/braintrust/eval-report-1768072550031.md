## Issues Identified

### HIGH: Agent ignores conversation context and always gives full greeting

**Current Behavior:** Agent starts every response with the same greeting and 10-step overview, even when user has already engaged or asked specific questions

**Suggested Fix:**
```
Add instruction: 'Only provide the full greeting and 10-step overview on the very first interaction. For subsequent responses, acknowledge what the user said and build on the existing conversation context.'
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 1 - Channel Question (Should Redirect), Step 1 - Volume Target

---

### HIGH: Agent fails to perform required calculations when data is available

**Current Behavior:** When budget ($250,000) and volume target (5,000) are provided, agent doesn't calculate the implied CAC of $50 or provide benchmark context

**Suggested Fix:**
```
Add instruction: 'When both budget and volume targets are provided, ALWAYS calculate the implied CAC (budget ÷ volume) and compare it to industry benchmarks with citations. Example: "That implies a $50 CAC. According to Blueshift (2023), fintech CACs average $175, so this is quite aggressive."'
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 1 - Volume Target

---

### MEDIUM: Agent doesn't acknowledge user's specific question before redirecting

**Current Behavior:** When user asks about channels, agent jumps straight to greeting instead of acknowledging the channel question first

**Suggested Fix:**
```
Add instruction: 'Always acknowledge what the user specifically asked about before redirecting. Example: "Great question about channels! Before we can determine the right channels, we need to establish your foundation first."'
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 1 - Channel Question (Should Redirect)

---

### MEDIUM: Agent asks vague follow-up questions instead of building on provided data

**Current Behavior:** When user provides volume target, agent asks generic 'what business outcome' question instead of building on the specific data provided

**Suggested Fix:**
```
Add instruction: 'When user provides specific data (budget, volume, etc.), acknowledge it specifically and ask the next logical question to build on that information rather than asking generic questions.'
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 1 - Volume Target
