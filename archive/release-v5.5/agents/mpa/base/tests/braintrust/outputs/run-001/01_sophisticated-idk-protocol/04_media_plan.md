# Media Plan Output: Sophisticated User - IDK Protocol

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start - you've given me your core objective: 10,000 new users with $500K spend. That's $500K ÷ 10,000 = $50 per user acquisition, which is tight but achievable for fintech.

To define success clearly: what's your primary success metric? Are you measuring new registered users, users who complete their first transaction, or something else? This shapes how we optimize the entire campaign.

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect - first transaction completers is the right success metric. That $50 per transacting user is more realistic than it initially appeared.

Based on fintech benchmarks, remittance companies typically see $40-80 acquisition costs for first transaction users, so your $50 target sits right in the sweet spot. The key factors that make this achievable:

**Your efficiency looks viable because:**
- Remittance has strong intent-driven search volume
- Geographic targeting (diaspora communities) enables precision
- Transaction urgency creates faster conversion than typical fintech

**For LTV modeling:** I'll estimate 2-3% take rate on transactions, which is standard for remittance. If your average user sends $200 monthly and stays active 18 months, that projects roughly $72-108 LTV. At $50 CAC, you'd hit a healthy 1.4-2.2x LTV/CAC ratio.

Does that transaction volume and retention estimate align with what you're seeing from existing users? Even rough directional sense helps validate if this efficiency target is realistic.
