USER:
Hi! I'm looking to get more people to buy shoes from our online store. Can you help me figure out the best way to do that?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What business outcome are you trying to achieve? For example, are you looking to bring in new customers, get existing customers to buy more often, or something else?

TURN 2 (Step 1)

USER:
We definitely want to bring in new customers - that's our main goal right now. We've been in business for a while but our online sales haven't been growing as fast as we'd like. I think we need more people to discover our brand and try our shoes for the first time.

AGENT:
Perfect! Bringing in new customers is a clear objective. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success.

How will you know if the campaign is working? For example, do you track it by counting new customers, total sales dollars, or something else? And what's your target number - like how many new customers do you want to bring in?

TURN 3 (Step 3)

USER:
We usually track it by looking at our total sales and how many orders we get each month. I guess counting new customers would make sense too, though I'm not sure exactly how to separate those from our repeat customers in our system. As for a target number, I haven't really thought about a specific goal - maybe we could figure that out together based on what's realistic with our budget?

AGENT:
Great! Let's work backwards from your budget to set a realistic target. 

How much can you invest in this campaign? Once I know your budget, I can show you what that typically translates to in terms of new customers for online shoe businesses.

Also, what does a typical new customer spend on their first order with you?
