# Media Plan Output: Basic User - Steps 1-2 Completion

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What business outcome are you trying to achieve? For example, are you looking to bring in new customers, get existing customers to buy more often, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Bringing in new customers is a clear objective. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success.

How will you know if the campaign is working? For example, do you track it by counting new customers, total sales dollars, or something else? And what's your target number - like how many new customers do you want to bring in?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Great! Let's work backwards from your budget to set a realistic target. 

How much can you invest in this campaign? Once I know your budget, I can show you what that typically translates to in terms of new customers for online shoe businesses.

Also, what does a typical new customer spend on their first order with you?
