TURN 1 (Step 1)

USER:
Hi, I'm the VP of Growth at PayStream Financial. We're a fintech payments platform. I need to build a media plan for next year. We have a $2M budget and need to acquire 50,000 new merchants. Our merchant LTV is about $850. Can you help me structure this?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect starting point - you've given me strong foundation data. Let me quickly model what you've shared:

$2M ÷ 50,000 = $40 per merchant acquisition
At $850 LTV, that's a 21.25x LTV/CAC ratio - extremely healthy efficiency.

Before we dive deeper into the economics, I want to clarify your primary business outcome. When you say "acquire 50,000 new merchants" - are you focused on total merchant sign-ups, or merchants who reach a specific activation threshold like processing their first $1,000 in transactions?

This distinction affects how we structure attribution and optimize campaigns.

TURN 2 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Good question - we're focused on activated merchants who process at least their first $1,000 in transactions. Sign-ups are vanity metrics for us since our real value comes from transaction volume. We typically see about 60% of sign-ups reach that activation threshold, so we'd need roughly 83,000 total sign-ups to hit our 50,000 activated merchant target.

AGENT:
Excellent clarification - focusing on activated merchants is much smarter than vanity sign-ups. Your 60% activation rate gives us a clear conversion funnel to model.

Let me recalculate with the activation reality:
- 83,000 sign-ups needed → $2M ÷ 83,000 = $24 cost per sign-up
- 50,000 activated merchants → $2M ÷ 50,000 = $40 cost per activated merchant

That $40 CAC against $850 LTV maintains your strong 21.25x ratio.

Now for the critical economics question: What's your average take rate on merchant transactions? For payment platforms, I typically see 2-3%, but knowing your specific rate helps me validate whether that $850 LTV calculation accounts for realistic transaction volumes and retention patterns.

This affects whether your efficiency target is conservative, typical, or aggressive for fintech merchant acquisition.

Events: calculation_performed, benchmark_cited, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 3 (Step 2)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our take rate is around 2.8%, which is pretty competitive in our segment. We're targeting small businesses doing $10K-100K monthly, so our average merchant processes about $45K per month. The $850 LTV assumes they stick around for about 3 years on average, though honestly our retention data is still maturing since we've been scaling fast. That 21x ratio feels aggressive but we need to hit our ARR targets this year.

AGENT:
Great context. Let me validate your LTV math:
$45K monthly × 2.8% = $1,260 annual revenue per merchant
Over 3 years = $3,780 total revenue per merchant

Your $850 LTV suggests roughly 22% contribution margin after processing costs, ops, and support - that's realistic for your segment.

The 21x LTV/CAC ratio IS aggressive. High-performing fintech typically sees 8-12x ratios, with exceptional cases hitting 15x. Your target requires extremely tight execution.

Here's what concerns me: if retention assumptions prove optimistic (common with fast-scaling fintechs), your actual LTV could be closer to $600-700. That would put you at 15-17x ratio - still ambitious but more defensible.

Two quick economics questions:
1. Do you have cohort data showing actual 12-month retention rates?
2. What's driving the pressure for such aggressive efficiency - is this purely ARR targets or also profitability constraints?

Understanding this helps me recommend the right risk level for channel mix and audience targeting.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 4 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our 12-month retention is sitting around 75%, though that's based on cohorts from when we were smaller and had more hands-on onboarding. You're right to be concerned - we might be optimistic on the 3-year assumption. 

The aggressive efficiency target is definitely driven by our Series B investors wanting to see a path to profitability. We're burning through cash scaling the team and need to prove unit economics work at scale. Our board is pushing hard on both ARR growth AND showing we can acquire merchants profitably, so there's not much wiggle room on that $40 CAC target.

AGENT:
That's the classic Series B squeeze - growth AND efficiency simultaneously. Your 75% 12-month retention from smaller cohorts is solid, but you're wise to worry about retention at scale with less hands-on touch.

Let me model a more conservative scenario:
If retention drops to 65% at scale and average lifespan becomes 2.5 years:
$1,260 annual revenue × 2.5 years × 22% margin = ~$693 LTV

That would put you at 17.3x LTV/CAC - still aggressive but more realistic for board presentations.

Given the board pressure and tight efficiency requirements, we need a precision-focused strategy. This means:
- Extremely tight audience targeting (likely 20-30 audience signals)
- Heavy emphasis on lookalike audiences from your best merchants
- Rigorous incrementality testing since platform ROAS will inflate

Quick transition question: Do you have a solid first-party data foundation? Specifically, can you export your highest-value activated merchants for lookalike modeling, and do you have enough volume for meaningful lookalikes across major platforms?

This determines whether we can hit your aggressive targets or need contingency planning.

TURN 5 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Yeah, that conservative modeling makes me feel better about our board deck - 17x is still aggressive but defensible. Our first-party data situation is pretty solid actually. We've got about 12,000 activated merchants we can export, with good demographic and behavioral data since our onboarding captures business type, revenue range, and processing patterns. 

Should be enough volume for meaningful lookalikes on the major platforms. Our best merchants tend to be service-based businesses - contractors, consultants, small agencies - who process consistently month over month. We can definitely segment by value tiers for more targeted lookalike audiences.

AGENT:
Perfect - 12,000 activated merchants is excellent seed data, and service-based businesses are ideal because they have predictable cash flow and lower churn than retail.

Your first-party advantage changes everything. Lookalike audiences from high-value merchants typically outperform cold prospecting by 40-60%, which is exactly what you need to hit that aggressive $40 CAC target.

With your strong data foundation established, let's move to audience definition. Given your $2M budget and precision requirements, we need laser-focused targeting.

Your best merchants are service-based businesses (contractors, consultants, agencies) processing $10K-100K monthly. To build the tightest possible audiences:

What are the 3-4 most specific business types within that service category that show the highest LTV and fastest activation? For example, are HVAC contractors better than general contractors, or do marketing agencies activate faster than accounting firms?

This granularity determines whether we build 3-4 highly specific lookalike audiences or one broader service-business lookalike.

Events: benchmark_cited, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 6 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
From our data, marketing agencies and IT consultants are definitely our highest performers - they activate fast and have consistent monthly volume. HVAC contractors are solid too, especially the larger ones doing commercial work. Professional services like accounting firms and legal practices take longer to activate but have great retention once they're up and running.

I'd say our top tiers are marketing agencies, IT/tech consultants, and commercial contractors. The accounting and legal folks are good long-term but might not help us hit those aggressive acquisition targets since they're slower to ramp up their processing volume.

AGENT:
Excellent segmentation - that gives us a clear targeting hierarchy. Marketing agencies and IT consultants are perfect for aggressive CAC targets since they activate quickly and process consistently.

For your $2M budget, I'd recommend building separate lookalike audiences for each tier:
- Tier 1: Marketing agencies + IT consultants (fastest activation)
- Tier 2: Commercial contractors (solid volume)
- Tier 3: Professional services (retention play)

We'd weight budget heavily toward Tier 1 for your aggressive targets, with Tier 2 as volume support and Tier 3 as a longer-term efficiency play.

Now for geography - this affects both audience size and competitive dynamics. Are you targeting nationwide, or do you have geographic constraints? Payment platforms often see regional clustering, especially for contractors who work locally.

Also, are there any states or metros where you already have strong merchant density that could serve as expansion bases?

Events: step_transition

TURN 7 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're primarily focused on major metros right now - NYC, LA, Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta - where we have the strongest merchant density. Those markets have been our bread and butter. But we're definitely looking to expand into secondary markets like Austin, Denver, Nashville, and some of the faster-growing metros in the Southeast.

The geographic clustering is real - our contractors especially tend to refer other local businesses, so once we get traction in a market, it builds momentum. We've seen that network effect work really well in Dallas and Atlanta. I'd say about 70% of our budget should probably stay in those core metros where we know the unit economics work, with 30% testing expansion markets where we can potentially get cheaper CPMs but less proven conversion rates.

AGENT:
Smart geographic strategy - that 70/30 split leverages your proven markets while testing expansion. The network effect you're seeing is gold for payment platforms, especially with contractors who work together on projects.

Your core metros (NYC, LA, Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta) likely have higher CPMs but proven conversion paths. The expansion markets (Austin, Denver, Nashville, Southeast) offer cheaper media costs but unknown activation rates.

Given your aggressive $40 CAC target, this geographic approach is crucial:
- Core metros: Higher confidence in hitting efficiency targets
- Expansion markets: Potential for better-than-modeled performance if conversion rates hold

Before we dive into budget allocation across these markets, let me understand your value proposition positioning. When marketing agencies or IT consultants are evaluating payment platforms, what's your key differentiator?

Is it pricing/rates, ease of integration, specific features, or something else? This determines whether we lead with rational benefits (save money, integrate faster) or emotional benefits (grow your business, professional image).

Your messaging strategy directly impacts which channels will be most effective.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 8 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our main differentiator is definitely ease of integration and speed to activation. Most of our competitors require weeks of technical setup, but we can get merchants processing payments within 24-48 hours. That's huge for agencies and consultants who need to start billing clients immediately.

We're also competitive on rates - not the cheapest but within range - and our dashboard is built specifically for service businesses rather than retail, so the reporting and invoicing features actually make sense for their workflow. The emotional hook is really about getting paid faster and looking professional with clients, but the rational sell is that setup that used to take weeks now takes days.

AGENT:
Perfect positioning - "processing payments in 24-48 hours vs. weeks" is a compelling rational differentiator, especially for service businesses who need immediate cash flow.

That value prop works beautifully for your target audiences:
- Marketing agencies: Need to bill retainers quickly to maintain cash flow
- IT consultants: Often project-based, need fast payment setup between clients
- Commercial contractors: Cash flow critical, can't wait weeks for payment processing

The "get paid faster + look professional" combination gives us both rational proof points and emotional resonance.

Now let's structure your $2M budget. Based on everything we've covered:

**Geographic Split:**
- $1.4M core metros (70%) - proven $40 CAC performance
- $600K expansion markets (30%) - testing cheaper CPMs

**Audience Priority:**
- 50% marketing agencies + IT consultants (fast activation)
- 30% commercial contractors (volume support)  
- 20% professional services (retention play)

Does this allocation align with your growth priorities, or would you weight differently between audience tiers?
