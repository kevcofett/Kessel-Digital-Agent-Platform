# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience with Different KPIs Per Segment

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build this multi-segment media plan with you. This is exactly the kind of strategic complexity where proper planning creates massive efficiency gains.

You've outlined a sophisticated three-segment approach with clear budget allocation and distinct objectives. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your conquest segment since awareness campaigns require the longest planning horizon. For your competitor vehicle owners who you want to shift into consideration for their next purchase in 2-3 years:

What specific business outcome defines success for this awareness investment? For example, are you targeting a measurable shift in brand consideration scores, or is success defined by reaching a specific percentage of competitor owners in your market with sufficient frequency to drive recall?

The distinction matters because it determines whether we optimize for reach efficiency or consideration lift, which impacts everything from channel selection to creative rotation.

Turn 2:
Perfect. So conquest success requires both reach efficiency (60% of competitor owners at 3+ monthly frequency) AND consideration lift (15-20% improvement in aided awareness and purchase intent). That dual requirement will drive us toward channels that deliver both scale and brand-building impact.

Now let me model the volume implications. In a 50-mile radius around 12 dealerships, you're likely looking at 150,000-250,000 competitor vehicle owners depending on market density. At 60% reach, that's roughly 90,000-150,000 people monthly.

With 35% of $4.5M = $1.575M annually for conquest, that projects to approximately $10-17 per person reached annually, which is achievable for sustained awareness campaigns in automotive.

Quick economics check before we move to your lead gen segment: Do you have brand lift study budgets built into that $1.575M, or would measurement come from a separate research allocation? Brand lift validation typically runs $15-25K per study, and you'll want quarterly measurement to optimize the consideration impact.

Turn 4:
Perfect math check: $2.025M targeting 15,000-20,000 qualified leads = $101-135 per lead. That's in the premium range but realistic for automotive, especially if it delivers the 25-30% showroom conversion you're seeing.

Let me validate the full funnel: 17,500 leads (midpoint) × 27.5% showroom rate × 17.5% close rate = roughly 840 vehicle sales from lead gen. At $135 per lead, that's about $2,400 in media cost per vehicle sold - very reasonable for automotive.

The quality focus is exactly right. Better to hit 15K high-converting leads than 25K weak ones that waste showroom time.

Now for your retention segment: 20% of $4.5M = $900K targeting existing customers for service appointments, trade-in inquiries, and lease renewals. 

What's your current customer database size across all 12 dealerships, and how do you typically segment them for lifecycle marketing? The retention economics are completely different - much lower acquisition cost but higher engagement requirements.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Noted - brand lift measurement will need separate allocation. At $15-25K quarterly, that's $60-100K annually for proper consideration tracking. Flag that for your research budget planning.

Your conquest economics look solid. Now let's tackle your lead generation segment - this is where the math gets critical.

With 45% of $4.5M = $2.025M for in-market shoppers targeting leads (VDP views, form fills, calls, test drives), I need to understand your volume expectations and unit economics.

What's your target for total qualified leads annually across all 12 dealerships? And what does a qualified lead typically convert to in terms of showroom visits and eventual sales?

The automotive lead gen space is highly competitive with CPLs ranging from $25-150+ depending on quality and market, so understanding your conversion funnel helps determine if $2.025M can deliver the volume you need.

Turn 6:
Perfect context. Three metros with 4 dealerships each creates both opportunities and complexity. The two major metros give you buying power and scale, while the fragmented DMA requires more tactical precision.

This geographic spread has major implications for your $4.5M budget allocation. You'll likely need market-specific strategies - the fragmented DMA might require 20-30% higher CPMs but could have less competitive conquest targeting.

With your outcomes and economics mapped across all three segments, let's move to audience definition. Starting with conquest since it's the most complex:

For your competitor vehicle owners in each market, how do you currently identify them? Are you working with registration data, dealer trade-in lists, service records from other dealers, or relying on platform targeting signals like automotive intenders and competitor brand affinity?

The data source determines both precision and scale - first-party data is most accurate but limited, while platform signals scale better but with efficiency trade-offs.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Excellent - 45,000-50,000 customers gives you strong scale for retention. $900K across that database = $18-20 per customer annually, which is robust for lifecycle marketing with owned data advantages.

Your lifecycle segmentation makes sense: recent purchasers for service adoption, mid-cycle for loyalty building, trade-in prospects for upgrade campaigns. The CRM automation gap is critical - retention campaigns live or die on trigger-based messaging.

Now I have solid economics for all three segments:
- Conquest: $1.575M reaching 90K-150K competitor owners
- Lead Gen: $2.025M targeting 15K-20K qualified leads  
- Retention: $900K engaging 45K-50K existing customers

Before we dive into audience definition, I need to understand your geographic footprint. You mentioned 50-mile radius, but with 12 dealerships across 3 brands, are these clustered in one metro area, or spread across multiple markets? 

This impacts everything from media buying efficiency to creative localization requirements.

Turn 8:
Exactly - treating immediate shoppers and researchers the same is leaving efficiency on the table. You're likely overpaying for researchers with immediate-shopper bids, while under-investing in the nurture sequences that convert them later.

Consider tiered targeting: immediate shoppers (VIN searches, price quotes, dealer visits) at higher CPLs for direct response, versus researchers (browsing, reviews, comparisons) at lower CPLs feeding into email nurture sequences. The pixel inconsistency across 12 locations is definitely limiting your first-party data advantages.

For your retention audience, this should be the most precise since it's your owned customer data. 

How clean is your customer segmentation across the 45K-50K database? Can you reliably identify customers approaching service intervals, lease maturity dates, or trade-in equity positions? And do you have unified customer records across all 12 locations, or are you working with siloed databases that might miss cross-location relationships?

Clean retention data drives the highest ROI campaigns, but fragmented data creates missed opportunities and message fatigue.

Turn 9:
You're absolutely right - unified CRM needs to move up the priority list. The cross-location relationships and duplicate targeting issues will eat into your $900K retention budget efficiency. A customer buying at Location A and servicing at Location B should trigger coordinated campaigns, not competing ones.

For now, we can work around the fragmentation by implementing campaign exclusion lists and frequency caps across locations, but the unified CRM investment will unlock much higher retention ROI long-term.

With your audience challenges mapped across all three segments, let's move to geography planning. You mentioned three metros - two major, one fragmented across smaller DMAs.

Can you name the specific markets? I need to model population data, media costs, and competitive density by DMA to properly allocate your $4.5M budget. Each market will likely need different budget weights based on opportunity size, media efficiency, and dealership capacity.

The major metros probably offer better conquest reach efficiency, while the fragmented market might have less competitive lead gen costs.

Turn 10:
Perfect - now I can model this properly. Dallas-Fort Worth (#5 DMA) and Houston (#8 DMA) give you massive scale, while East Texas spans Tyler-Longview (#110), Shreveport (#95), and potentially Monroe LA (#166) - much smaller but less competitive.

Here's the geographic opportunity analysis:

| Market | DMAs | Total Pop | Target Density | Conquest Efficiency | Lead Gen Competition | Dealership Capacity |
|--------|------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Dallas-Fort Worth | DFW | 7.8M | High | Good scale | High competition | High inventory |
| Houston | Houston | 7.2M | High | Good scale | High competition | High inventory |
| East Texas | Tyler-Longview, Shreveport, Monroe | 1.2M | Lower | Fragmented reach | Low competition | Limited inventory |
| **TOTAL** | | **16.2M** | | | | |

Your East Texas capacity constraint is critical - no point driving $25 CPLs if you can't fulfill inventory. We'll need to cap lead gen spend there based on realistic sales capacity.

What's your monthly vehicle sales capacity in East Texas versus Dallas/Houston? This determines budget allocation limits by segment.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Smart assessment. Registration data is indeed gold but limited coverage, especially in fragmented DMAs. Platform signals will be essential for your 60% reach target, but layering in first-party data where available creates efficiency gains.

For conquest precision, consider this hybrid approach: Use your DMS trade-in data to create lookalike audiences for platform expansion, while maintaining direct registration data targeting in your strongest coverage areas. This balances precision with scale.

Now for your in-market lead gen audience - this is where targeting precision directly impacts your $101-135 per lead efficiency. 

How are you currently identifying active vehicle shoppers? Are you targeting based on recent automotive site visits, VIN searches, dealer website behavior, or broader automotive research signals? And do you segment by purchase timeline - immediate shoppers versus 3-6 month researchers?

The distinction matters because immediate shoppers convert faster but cost more, while longer-timeline researchers are cheaper but require nurture sequences.

Turn 12:
Perfect - database split of 70/30 confirms your geographic allocation logic. Here's the refined geographic budget model:

**GEOGRAPHIC BUDGET ALLOCATION BY SEGMENT:**

| Segment | Total Budget | Dallas/Houston | East Texas | Logic |
|---------|--------------|----------------|------------|--------|
| **Conquest** | $1.575M | $1.10M (70%) | $475K (30%) | Higher East TX % - lower competition |
| **Lead Gen** | $2.025M | $1.72M (85%) | $305K (15%) | Capacity-constrained East TX |
| **Retention** | $900K | $630K (70%) | $270K (30%) | Follows database distribution |
| **TOTAL** | $4.5M | $3.45M (77%) | $1.05M (23%) |

This gives East Texas proportionally more conquest investment (30% vs 23% overall) while protecting against lead gen over-investment (15% vs capacity of 20-25%).

Now let's move to budget validation. With your outcomes, economics, audience, and geography mapped, I need to stress-test these allocations.

Looking at your lead gen segment: $1.72M in Dallas/Houston targeting roughly 13,000-15,000 qualified leads = $115-130 per lead. In highly competitive DFW and Houston automotive markets, is that efficiency realistic, or do we need to adjust expectations?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 11:
Exactly right - capacity should drive budget allocation, not just cost efficiency. Generating leads you can't fulfill damages brand reputation and wastes budget.

Based on your capacity data:
- Dallas/Houston: 800-900 units monthly = 75-80% of total volume
- East Texas: 200-250 units monthly = 20-25% of total volume

This suggests geographic budget allocation should roughly follow capacity:

**Proposed Geographic Split:**
- Dallas/Houston: ~75% of total budget ($3.375M)
- East Texas: ~25% of total budget ($1.125M)

But with segment-specific adjustments:
- **Conquest**: East Texas gets proportionally MORE (lower competition, longer timeline)
- **Lead Gen**: East Texas gets proportionally LESS (capacity constraint)
- **Retention**: Follows customer database distribution

Before I model the detailed geographic allocation, what's your customer database split between Dallas/Houston versus East Texas? This determines retention budget distribution and helps validate the overall geographic approach.

Turn 13:
Great reality check. At $140-160 DFW and $125-145 Houston CPLs, your $1.72M projects to roughly 11,000-13,700 qualified leads - not the 13,000-15,000 we modeled.

**REVISED LEAD GEN PROJECTION:**
- Dallas/Houston: $1.72M ÷ $135 average CPL = ~12,750 leads
- East Texas: $305K ÷ $75 CPL = ~4,050 leads  
- **Total: ~16,800 leads** (above your 15K-20K target range)

This actually works in your favor - East Texas's lower CPLs help offset the major metro premium, and 16,800 total leads exceeds your minimum target. The key is capping East Texas at realistic fulfillment capacity.

You're absolutely right about maintaining lead quality standards. Better to hit 12,750 convertible leads than chase 15,000 weak ones that waste BDC resources.

Now for value proposition planning. Each segment needs distinct messaging:

**Conquest**: Long-term consideration building for satisfied competitor owners
**Lead Gen**: Immediate conversion for active shoppers  
**Retention**: Lifecycle-specific offers for existing customers

What's your current brand differentiation strategy? Are you competing primarily on price, selection, service experience, or brand portfolio strength across your three automotive brands?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 14:
Excellent - you've got distinct value propositions that align with each segment's mindset. Multi-brand portfolio + geographic convenience for conquest, selection + speed for lead gen, relationship + convenience for retention.

This differentiation will drive channel selection. Conquest needs channels that can communicate complex brand portfolio benefits over time. Lead gen needs channels optimized for immediate inventory/offer presentation. Retention leverages owned channels for personalized relationship messaging.

With your value propositions mapped, let's move to channel planning. This is where your three-segment strategy gets operationalized.

Given your geographic spread, budget allocations, and distinct objectives, which channels are you currently using, and which are you considering? 

I'm particularly interested in how you're thinking about:
- **Upper funnel** for conquest (CTV, linear TV, programmatic display)
- **Performance channels** for lead gen (search, social, automotive sites)  
- **Owned channels** for retention (email, direct mail, CRM triggers)

Your channel mix will determine both efficiency and measurement complexity across segments.

Turn 15:
You've identified the core issue - being spread thin without strategic focus by segment. The measurement complexity you're experiencing is a direct result of conflicting objectives competing for the same channels.

Let me propose a cleaner channel architecture:

**CONQUEST (Brand Building) - $1.575M**
- Linear TV: Dallas/Houston only for sustained reach
- CTV: All markets for targeted frequency control  
- Programmatic Display: Lookalike audiences from trade-in data
- Facebook/Instagram: Reach campaigns, not conversion optimized

**LEAD GEN (Performance) - $2.025M**
- Google Search: Immediate shoppers, high-intent keywords
- Google Shopping: Inventory-based campaigns
- Facebook/Instagram: Lead generation objective, tiered by timeline
- Autotrader/Cars.com: Retargeting and inventory feeds
- YouTube: In-market automotive audiences

**RETENTION (Lifecycle) - $900K**
- Email: Automated lifecycle triggers
- Direct Mail: Trade-in equity campaigns
- Google/Facebook: Customer match audiences
- SMS: Service appointment reminders

This eliminates channel conflict and creates cleaner measurement paths. Each channel serves one primary objective.

Which of these channel shifts feels most challenging to implement given your current team capabilities and vendor relationships?

Turn 16:
Smart sequencing approach. You're right to phase this - trying to implement all three simultaneously would overwhelm your team and create execution gaps.

**RECOMMENDED IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE:**

**Phase 1 (Months 1-2): Conquest & Lead Gen Separation**
- Shift Facebook to reach campaigns for conquest
- Implement CTV across all markets with frequency caps
- Create tiered Google/Facebook lead gen by purchase timeline
- Cleanest measurement wins with minimal system disruption

**Phase 2 (Months 3-4): Lead Gen Optimization**  
- Refine immediate vs. researcher targeting
- Optimize Autotrader/Cars.com inventory feeds
- Add YouTube in-market campaigns

**Phase 3 (Months 5-6): Retention Foundation**
- Implement basic CRM triggers for service intervals
- Upgrade email automation for lifecycle stages
- Begin trade-in equity direct mail campaigns

This sequencing protects your current performance while building toward the sophisticated retention program that will drive highest long-term ROI.

Now for measurement planning - this is critical since you mentioned current measurement complexity is killing you. Each segment needs distinct KPIs and attribution models.

What measurement tools do you currently have in place, and how are you tracking cross-channel attribution today? The three-segment approach will require different measurement strategies for brand lift, lead attribution, and retention engagement.

Turn 17:
You've identified the exact measurement gaps that create the muddy attribution. Each segment needs fundamentally different measurement approaches - forcing lead gen metrics onto brand campaigns is why everything feels broken.

**RECOMMENDED MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK BY SEGMENT:**

**CONQUEST (Brand Building)**
- Primary: Brand lift studies (quarterly, $15-25K each)
- Secondary: Aided awareness, purchase intent surveys
- Tactical: Reach, frequency, brand search volume lift
- Attribution: Not applicable - focus on consideration metrics

**LEAD GEN (Performance)**  
- Primary: Cost per qualified lead, lead-to-sale conversion rate
- Secondary: Customer acquisition cost, sales attribution
- Tactical: Click-through rates, form completion rates
- Attribution: Multi-touch with 30-day window for nurture journeys

**RETENTION (Lifecycle)**
- Primary: Customer lifetime value, retention rate
- Secondary: Service appointment rate, trade-in conversion
- Tactical: Email engagement, SMS response rates
- Attribution: Direct response tracking sufficient

The biggest gap is cross-platform integration between your DMS and marketing platforms. Without that, you can't properly track the lead gen nurture journey or retention campaign effectiveness.

Which integration feels most critical to tackle first - connecting your DMS to Google/Facebook for better lead attribution, or implementing the brand lift measurement for conquest validation?

Turn 18:
Absolutely right - DMS integration delivers immediate optimization wins on your largest budget segment while building the foundation for retention automation. That's the highest ROI measurement investment.

**INTEGRATION PRIORITIES:**
1. DMS → Google/Facebook lead attribution (immediate lead gen optimization)  
2. DMS → Email/SMS triggers (retention automation foundation)
3. Brand lift studies (conquest validation in Phase 2)

Now let's move to testing strategy. With three distinct segments and phased implementation, you'll need different testing approaches for each.

For lead gen, you mentioned wanting to separate immediate shoppers from researchers - that's a perfect A/B test to validate the tiered approach. For conquest, creative fatigue will be critical given the sustained reach requirements.

What's your current testing capacity? Are you running systematic A/B tests now, or mostly making changes based on intuition? With $4.5M in spend, proper testing can drive significant efficiency gains, but it requires disciplined execution across multiple segments simultaneously.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 20:
You've identified the critical path risk - DMS integration failure cascades through both lead gen and retention segments. That's $2.925M of your $4.5M budget dependent on successful integration.

**RISK MITIGATION RECOMMENDATIONS:**

**DMS Integration (Critical Path)**
- Build manual backup attribution process before starting integration
- Set hard timeline with IT - if integration exceeds 90 days, implement interim solution
- Consider third-party attribution platform as fallback option

**Inventory/Brand Supply Chain**
- Weekly inventory health checks by brand across all locations
- Lead gen budget flex pools - shift spend from constrained brands to available inventory
- East Texas gets proportionally more conquest (not inventory-dependent) if supply issues hit

**Team Bandwidth (Execution Risk)**
- Delay Phase 3 testing until Phases 1-2 are stable
- Consider external support for DMS integration project management
- Start with conquest/lead gen separation only - retention can wait until Q2

You've built a sophisticated strategy that addresses real business needs across three distinct segments. The geographic allocation protects against capacity constraints, the channel architecture eliminates measurement conflicts, and the phased approach manages implementation risk.

Success depends on nailing that DMS integration. Everything else is manageable, but that's your make-or-break component.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 19:
Smart constraint recognition - testing discipline during major implementation changes can overwhelm teams. Let's prioritize high-impact, low-complexity tests that align with your phased rollout.

**RECOMMENDED TESTING SEQUENCE:**

**Phase 1 (Immediate Impact, Low Complexity)**
- Lead Gen: Immediate vs. researcher audience split test (single variable, huge budget impact)
- Conquest: 3-creative rotation vs. single creative (simple fatigue test)

**Phase 2 (Post-DMS Integration)**  
- Lead Gen: Nurture sequence length testing (3-touch vs. 5-touch)
- Retention: Email send time optimization (automated through new CRM)

**Phase 3 (Advanced Optimization)**
- Cross-segment: Geographic budget allocation refinement
- Creative: Dynamic product ads vs. static inventory

Start with just the audience split test for lead gen - if tiered targeting improves efficiency by even 10%, that's $200K+ in annual savings. One test, massive impact, minimal execution complexity.

Finally, let's address risks. With three segments, geographic spread, and phased implementation, what keeps you up at night about this plan? 

Budget concentration in major metros? East Texas capacity constraints? DMS integration timeline? Identifying the biggest risks helps us build contingencies upfront.

────────────────────────────────────────
