# Media Plan Output: Full 10-Step Media Planning

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your efficiency target. $750K ÷ 15,000 = $50 per customer acquisition. That's tight but achievable for home decor if we execute precisely.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve beyond customer acquisition - is this about revenue growth, market share, or something else?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect! Revenue growth to $8M with brand building - that's a clear objective. Your $450 LTV against $50 acquisition cost projects to a healthy 9x LTV/CAC ratio, which gives us excellent unit economics to work with.

Let me verify the math on your revenue target. With 15,000 new customers, what's the average order value you're expecting? Are you modeling first-purchase value or total customer value over time to reach that $8M target?

Turn 3:
Excellent - that math works well. 15,000 new customers × $180 first purchase = $2.7M from initial orders, with additional revenue from repeat purchases and your existing base getting you to $8M total.

Your $50 CAC against $180 first-purchase value gives us a 3.6x immediate ROAS, which is strong for home decor. The 9x lifetime ratio provides excellent margin for aggressive acquisition.

One key question for measuring success: Beyond the 15,000 customer count, what's your primary KPI - total revenue, new customer revenue, or something else? This determines how we track and optimize the campaign.

Turn 4:
Perfect! Total revenue as primary KPI with quality customer acquisition as secondary - that balance will guide our entire strategy.

Your targets look realistic: $50 CAC is achievable in home decor with focused execution, and the 9x LTV/CAC ratio gives us strong margin for testing and optimization.

Economics assessment complete. Now let's move to Step 3: Audience. 

For home decor, audience precision is critical since purchase intent varies dramatically. What does your ideal customer look like - are we targeting homeowners, renters, specific life stages, or income levels?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Excellent customer profile - homeowners 30-55, $60K+ income, suburban/urban, 70% women. That's a well-defined acquisition target.

A few key refinements to sharpen our targeting:

Are you focusing on specific home ownership stages? For example, recent buyers (moved within 2 years), active renovators, or established homeowners upgrading? Each stage has different purchase patterns and media consumption habits.

Turn 6:
Perfect segmentation - that mix gives us strong targeting signals. Recent movers (40%) are our highest-intent segment, renovators (35%) have project-driven urgency, and upgraders (25%) provide steady volume.

For media planning, these segments have different discovery patterns. Recent movers are actively searching, renovators research heavily, and upgraders browse more casually.

One more audience question: Within your homeowner targets, are there specific home value ranges or neighborhood types that convert better? This helps with geographic precision and channel selection.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Excellent - $300K-$800K home values in newer suburbs and gentrifying urban areas. That's precise targeting that will drive efficiency.

Audience definition complete. Moving to Step 4: Geography.

With your $750K budget and need for $50 CAC efficiency, geographic focus will be critical. Are you currently strong in specific regions, or looking to expand nationally? Home decor shipping costs and local competition vary significantly by market.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Smart approach - building from strength in Northeast/West Coast where you already have 60% of customers and established logistics.

For efficient expansion with your $50 CAC target, I'd recommend a tiered geographic strategy. Tier 1 would be your proven markets (Boston, NYC, SF, Seattle) where conversion rates are known. Tier 2 could be similar metros with comparable demographics - think Denver, Portland, Austin, DC.

What's your current shipping cost impact? For example, does shipping to a new market like Chicago or Atlanta add $20+ to your cost structure, or is it more manageable? This affects which markets we can enter profitably at $50 CAC.

Turn 9:
That $15-25 shipping impact is significant against your $50 CAC target - it essentially raises your true acquisition cost to $65-75 in expansion markets.

This suggests a product-mix strategy by geography. In proven markets, you can promote full catalog including furniture. In expansion markets, focus acquisition on smaller decor items with better shipping economics, then upsell furniture to converted customers.

Geography assessment complete. Moving to Step 5: Budget allocation.

With $750K total budget, how are you thinking about the split between your proven Northeast/West Coast markets versus expansion markets? The shipping economics suggest heavier weighting toward established markets.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
That's a solid starting split - $525K in proven markets, $225K for expansion. The 70/30 allocation makes sense given shipping economics.

Let me model this out: 
- Proven markets: $525K ÷ $50 CAC = 10,500 customers
- Expansion markets: $225K ÷ $75 effective CAC = 3,000 customers  
- Total: 13,500 customers

That's 1,500 customers short of your 15,000 target. We have two options: increase expansion budget efficiency through product-mix strategy, or shift more budget to proven markets where CAC is lower.

What's your priority - hitting the exact 15,000 customer count, or testing expansion markets even if it means slightly fewer total customers?

Turn 11:
Perfect strategic thinking! Let me model the revised split:

- Proven markets: $600K ÷ $50 CAC = 12,000 customers
- Expansion markets: $150K ÷ $75 effective CAC = 2,000 customers  
- Total: 14,000 customers

That still leaves us 1,000 customers short. We have a few options:
1. Push proven market efficiency below $50 CAC through optimization
2. Improve expansion efficiency through the product-mix strategy we discussed
3. Accept 14,000 customers and drive higher AOV to hit revenue target

Given your $180 AOV, 14,000 customers × $180 = $2.52M in first-purchase revenue. With repeat purchases, you could still hit $8M total. Which approach feels most comfortable to you?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 12:
Excellent! Targeting $45 CAC in proven markets is realistic with optimization. That gives us:

- Proven markets: $600K ÷ $45 CAC = 13,333 customers
- Expansion markets: $150K ÷ $75 CAC = 2,000 customers
- Total: 15,333 customers - exceeding your target!

The AOV increase to $200-220 through bundling provides additional upside. Budget allocation complete.

Moving to Step 6: Value Proposition.

With your audience targeting recent movers, renovators, and upgraders across different geographies, your messaging needs to resonate with each segment. What's your core value proposition - is it style, affordability, convenience, quality, or something else that differentiates HomeStyle Decor in the crowded home decor space?

Turn 13:
Perfect positioning - "curated style without the designer" hits your busy homeowner target beautifully. The convenience angle is especially strong for recent movers who need to furnish quickly and renovators working on timelines.

For your three audience segments, this value prop can flex nicely:
- Recent movers: "Complete your new space effortlessly" 
- Renovators: "Coordinated pieces that work together"
- Upgraders: "Refresh your style without starting over"

The "visualize in your home" capability is a strong differentiator online. Value proposition complete.

Moving to Step 7: Channels. Now we can match your curated convenience message to where your audience discovers home decor. What channels are currently working best for you, and where do you see your target customers spending time?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 10: Risks

Turn 14:
Excellent foundation - Google Search for high-intent purchase moments, Meta for visual discovery, and Pinterest for inspiration. That matches your customer journey perfectly.

Given your $45 target CAC in proven markets and audience segments, I'd recommend this channel allocation:

- Google Search: 40% ($300K) - captures renovators and recent movers actively shopping
- Meta (Facebook/Instagram): 35% ($262K) - visual discovery for all segments  
- Pinterest: 15% ($113K) - inspiration phase, especially for upgraders
- YouTube: 10% ($75K) - home makeover content for engaged audiences

This prioritizes your proven performers while adding YouTube for video content around room transformations. Does this allocation align with where you're seeing the best customer quality, not just volume?
