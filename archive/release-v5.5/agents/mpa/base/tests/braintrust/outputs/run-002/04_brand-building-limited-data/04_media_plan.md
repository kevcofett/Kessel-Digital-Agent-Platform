# Media Plan Output: Brand Building with Limited Data

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you for GreenLeaf Wellness. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You mentioned building brand awareness on the West Coast with a $500K budget - that's a solid foundation to work with. To start, what specific business outcome are you trying to achieve? For example, are you looking to drive online sales, get people into retail stores, build email subscribers, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Online sales as your primary outcome with email capture as a bonus - that's a clear, measurable objective.

Now I need to understand how you'll measure success. What's the key number you'll track to know if this campaign worked? For example, will you measure total revenue generated, number of new customers acquired, or something else?

Turn 3:
Excellent - new customer acquisition is the right focus for market entry. Now I need one more piece to complete your objective: what's your target for new customers? 

With your $500K budget, how many first-time customers are you hoping to acquire on the West Coast?

Turn 4:
Let me check those numbers: $500K ÷ 2,500 customers (midpoint) = $200 per customer. That efficiency target is definitely achievable for wellness supplements.

Based on industry benchmarks, supplement brands typically see $75-300 per customer acquisition, with premium natural products often in the $150-250 range you mentioned. Your target sits right in the sweet spot.

Before we assess if this efficiency works for your business, I need to understand your customer value. What does a typical first-time customer spend on their initial order?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 5:
Got it - $80 average first order (using your midpoint). At $200 acquisition cost, that means you'd spend $200 to get $80 in immediate revenue.

This only works if customers come back to buy more. How much does a typical customer spend with you over their lifetime? For example, do they usually make 2-3 more purchases over the next year, or is it more?

This is crucial because $200 to acquire an $80 customer means you need strong repeat business to be profitable.

Turn 6:
I'll model using $350 total customer value over the first year based on your estimate. At $200 acquisition cost, that projects to a 1.75x return - which is tight but workable for a new brand building market presence.

$200 acquisition cost ÷ $350 customer value = 57% of revenue spent on acquisition

Industry benchmarks suggest wellness brands typically spend 30-50% of customer value on acquisition, so your target is aggressive but achievable with tight execution. To hit this efficiency, we'll need precise audience targeting and strong conversion optimization.

This completes your economics foundation. Ready to move to Step 3 and define your target audience on the West Coast?

Turn 7:
Great start! Health-conscious millennials and Gen Z ages 25-40 who value natural, quality ingredients - that's a strong foundation.

To make this audience more precise, what specific behaviors or interests help you identify your best customers? For example, do they typically shop at certain stores, follow particular wellness trends, have specific health goals, or engage with certain types of content?

The more specific we can get, the better we can target people most likely to become repeat customers at your price point.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 8:
Perfect - that paints a clear picture of premium wellness consumers. You've identified strong behavioral and lifestyle signals.

Let me add one more layer: are there any life stage factors that matter? For example, do you see patterns around people who are new parents, recent college grads starting careers, or professionals dealing with high stress? 

Or are the shopping and wellness behaviors you mentioned the primary way to identify your audience regardless of their specific life situation?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 9:
Excellent - stressed professionals seeking natural energy, focus, and sleep solutions is a highly targetable and valuable segment. They have both the motivation and means for premium supplements.

Your audience is well-defined: health-conscious millennials/Gen Z (25-40), shop at premium retailers like Whole Foods, active lifestyle (yoga/hiking), follow wellness content, busy professionals managing stress with disposable income for natural solutions.

Now let's confirm geography. You mentioned California, Oregon, and Washington. Are you targeting all major metro areas across these three states, or do you want to focus on specific cities like LA, SF, Seattle, Portland?

Turn 10:
Smart approach - focusing on metro areas with concentrated target audiences maximizes efficiency. LA, SF, Seattle, Portland, San Diego, and Sacramento gives you strong coverage of premium wellness consumers.

Quick budget check: with $500K across six major metros targeting 2,500 new customers, that's roughly $83K per market and 415 customers per metro. Those are solid investment levels for meaningful impact.

Now let's allocate your budget geographically. Should we weight this evenly across all six markets, or do you want to prioritize certain metros? For example, LA and SF are larger but more expensive, while Portland and Sacramento might be more cost-efficient.

Turn 11:
Your instincts are solid! Let me show you the math and check costs:

**Your proposed allocation:**
- LA: $125-150K (25-30%)
- SF: $100K (20%) 
- Seattle: $100K (20%)
- Portland: $75K (15%)
- San Diego: $50K (10%)
- Sacramento: $50K (10%)

You're right about costs - LA and SF typically run 40-60% higher than Portland/Sacramento for digital media. At your current allocation, LA would need to deliver 500-600 customers at $200-250 per customer, which is aggressive for that market.

Should we rebalance to account for higher costs in LA/SF, or increase their efficiency targets since they're priority markets?

Turn 12:
Perfect rebalancing! Let me show you the math:

**Revised allocation:**
- LA: $100K (20%) → ~400 customers at $250 CAC
- Portland: $100K (20%) → ~625 customers at $160 CAC  
- SF: $90K (18%) → ~375 customers at $240 CAC
- Seattle: $90K (18%) → ~500 customers at $180 CAC
- San Diego: $60K (12%) → ~350 customers at $170 CAC
- Sacramento: $60K (12%) → ~400 customers at $150 CAC

Total: 2,650 customers, blended $188 CAC

This is much more realistic - you're accounting for market costs while still prioritizing key metros. Portland gets the volume it deserves as a wellness-friendly market, and your efficiency targets are achievable.

Ready to move to Step 5 and work on your value proposition for these West Coast customers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 13:
Excellent! Your West Coast audience - stressed professionals seeking natural wellness solutions - needs messaging that speaks directly to their lifestyle and values.

Based on what you've shared, I see a few potential value proposition angles:

**"Premium natural supplements designed for busy professionals who refuse to compromise on quality"** - emphasizing both convenience and premium positioning

**"Science-backed wellness solutions with clean ingredients for sustainable energy and stress management"** - focusing on efficacy and natural benefits

**"Wellness that works with your lifestyle, not against it"** - emphasizing convenience and integration

Which of these directions feels most authentic to your brand, or is there a different angle that better captures what makes GreenLeaf Wellness unique?

Turn 14:
Perfect refinement! "Science-backed wellness with clean ingredients that fits your busy lifestyle" hits all the key motivators for your audience.

This positions you against both cheap synthetic supplements AND inconvenient wellness routines. Your stressed professionals get the efficacy proof they need plus the lifestyle integration they want.

Supporting messages could emphasize:
- Third-party tested, clean formulations
- Designed for sustained energy without crashes
- Convenient daily routines that actually work
- Natural stress management for demanding schedules

This value proposition is strong enough to justify your premium pricing and should resonate across all six metros, especially in wellness-forward Portland.

Ready for Step 7? Now we can build your channel strategy to deliver this message efficiently to health-conscious professionals across the West Coast.
