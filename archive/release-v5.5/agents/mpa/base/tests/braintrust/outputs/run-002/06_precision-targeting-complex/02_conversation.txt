TURN 1 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I'm the Director of Performance Marketing at LuxeFinance, a wealth management firm. We need to build a precision media plan to acquire high-net-worth individuals - specifically people with $1M+ in investable assets, typically 45-65, executives and business owners who are either approaching retirement or have a major liquidity event coming up. We're interested in people researching tax optimization and estate planning. Budget is $1.5M, targeting 2,500 qualified leads. We have CRM data on 50K existing clients we can use for modeling. Focus on top DMAs by HNW concentration - NYC, SF, LA, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Denver, Miami, Dallas, DC. Quality matters more than volume here.

AGENT:
Hi! I am excited to build a media plan with you. We will cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Your setup is impressive - targeting HNW individuals with $1M+ investable assets, 2,500 qualified leads from $1.5M budget, and strong CRM data for modeling. The precision approach is exactly right for wealth management.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 2,500 qualified leads? For example, are you targeting a certain number of new client conversions, AUM growth target, or revenue milestone?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 2 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're primarily focused on AUM growth - looking to add around $500M in new assets under management over the next 18 months. Based on our historical data, we typically see about a 12-15% conversion rate from qualified leads to actual clients, so the 2,500 MQLs should get us roughly 300-375 new client relationships. Our average new client brings in about $1.8M in investable assets, so we should hit that $500M target if the lead quality stays consistent with what we've seen from our referral channels.

AGENT:
Perfect. $1.5M budget targeting $500M in new AUM through 300-375 client conversions - that's a clear growth objective with strong historical backing.

$1.5M / 2,500 leads = $600 per qualified lead. With your 12-15% lead-to-client conversion rate, that implies $4,000-5,000 per new client acquisition cost.

Given that your average new client brings $1.8M in AUM, this efficiency looks very strong for wealth management. Industry benchmarks for HNW acquisition typically run $3,000-8,000 per client depending on channel mix and precision.

How much revenue does LuxeFinance typically generate from a new $1.8M client relationship in the first year? This helps us validate whether your $4,000-5,000 acquisition cost creates positive unit economics.

TURN 3 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Honestly, I don't have the exact first-year revenue figures off the top of my head - that's more on the finance side. But I'd estimate we're probably looking at around 1-1.2% management fees on that $1.8M, so roughly $18-22K in annual revenue per client. The CAC to LTV ratio should work out pretty well, especially since these relationships tend to be long-term and often grow over time as clients consolidate more assets with us.

AGENT:
Got it. I'll model using $20K first-year revenue based on your 1-1.2% fee estimate. At $4,000-5,000 CAC, that projects to a 4-5x first-year revenue multiple, which is healthy for wealth management before factoring in relationship growth and retention.

$20K annual revenue / $4,500 blended CAC = 4.4x first-year return

This efficiency target is achievable but requires precision execution given the narrow HNW audience. Your 50K client CRM for lookalike modeling is a major advantage here.

Now let's define your target audience precisely. You mentioned $1M+ investable assets, ages 45-65, executives and business owners approaching retirement or liquidity events, researching tax optimization and estate planning.

What behavioral signals beyond research topics help you identify someone who's genuinely ready to move assets versus just browsing? For example, do they typically engage with specific content types, attend certain events, or show other intent indicators?

Events: calculation_performed, benchmark_cited, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 4 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
From our first-party data, we see strong intent signals when prospects engage with our more advanced content - things like estate planning calculators, tax loss harvesting guides, or our quarterly market outlook reports. They also tend to spend more time on advisor bio pages and office location pages, which suggests they're evaluating us as a potential partner. We've noticed that prospects who download multiple pieces of content within a 30-day window have about 3x higher conversion rates. Another key signal is engagement with content around major life events - like selling a business, inheritance planning, or pre-retirement asset allocation strategies.

AGENT:
Excellent - those are strong intent signals that indicate genuine readiness to engage. Multiple content downloads within 30 days showing 3x higher conversion rates is particularly valuable for optimization.

Your behavioral signals paint a clear picture: advanced content engagement (calculators, guides, market reports), advisor/location research, clustered engagement patterns, and major life event content consumption.

Given your target DMAs (NYC, SF, LA, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Denver, Miami, Dallas, DC), which 2-3 markets typically produce your highest-value clients or strongest conversion rates? This helps us understand where to weight investment for maximum efficiency within your precision approach.

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 5 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
NYC and SF are definitely our strongest markets - probably 40% of our new AUM comes from those two metros. NYC gives us the highest volume of prospects, especially from the finance and real estate sectors, while SF tends to have the highest average account sizes due to all the tech wealth. Chicago has been surprisingly strong for us too, particularly with manufacturing executives and family business owners who are looking at succession planning. I'd probably weight those three markets heaviest, with NYC getting maybe 25-30% of budget allocation, SF around 20%, and Chicago 15%.

AGENT:
Perfect. NYC (25-30%), SF (20%), and Chicago (15%) as your core markets makes strategic sense given proven performance and sector concentration.

That allocates 60-65% of budget to your top three markets, leaving 35-40% for the remaining seven DMAs. Based on your $1.5M budget, we're looking at approximately:

- NYC: $375-450K  
- SF: $300K
- Chicago: $225K
- Remaining 7 DMAs: $525-600K combined

Before we map the full geography allocation, what's your minimum viable spend threshold per DMA? Some wealth management campaigns need $50-75K minimum per market to achieve meaningful reach against HNW audiences, while others can work effectively with smaller allocations.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 6 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Yeah, we've found that anything under $75K per DMA just doesn't move the needle with HNW audiences - the reach gets too thin and frequency suffers. We'd rather concentrate our spend in fewer markets where we can actually break through. So for those remaining seven DMAs, I'd probably focus on the top 4-5 and allocate around $100-125K each rather than spreading it too thin. Boston, Seattle, and Dallas have shown decent performance historically, so those would be my next priorities after the big three.

AGENT:
Smart approach. $75K minimum per DMA ensures meaningful reach against HNW audiences rather than ineffective thin coverage.

Let's map this out:
- NYC: $400K (27%)
- SF: $300K (20%) 
- Chicago: $225K (15%)
- Boston: $200K (13%)
- Seattle: $200K (13%)
- Dallas: $175K (12%)

Total: $1.5M across 6 DMAs with $100K+ minimum each

This concentration strategy should generate much stronger frequency and breakthrough against your target audience than spreading across all 10 markets.

Now, what's your current understanding of LuxeFinance's value proposition that resonates most with prospects during major life transitions? Is it specialized expertise, personalized service, investment performance, or something else that typically closes these HNW relationships?

Events: benchmark_cited, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 7 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
That allocation looks solid - concentrating on six markets where we can actually make an impact rather than spreading thin. 

Our value prop really centers around comprehensive wealth planning during major transitions. What resonates most is our ability to coordinate the entire financial picture - not just investment management, but tax optimization, estate planning, and business succession all under one roof. HNW prospects are tired of managing relationships with five different advisors who don't talk to each other. Our integrated approach, especially around complex tax situations and liquidity events, is what typically wins the business. The personalized service piece is critical too - these clients expect direct advisor access, not getting shuffled to junior associates.

AGENT:
Excellent - that integrated approach addressing coordination pain points is a compelling differentiator for HNW prospects managing complex financial situations.

Your value proposition of "comprehensive wealth planning during major transitions" with coordinated tax optimization, estate planning, and succession under one roof directly addresses the fragmented advisor problem. The direct advisor access reinforces the premium positioning.

Now let's validate your budget efficiency. With $1.5M targeting 2,500 qualified leads across 6 concentrated DMAs, we need tight execution to hit $600 per qualified lead in these premium markets.

HNW media typically runs higher CPMs due to audience scarcity. Based on your 50K client CRM for lookalike modeling and strong intent signals, are you confident this $600 cost per qualified lead is achievable, or should we model scenarios at different efficiency levels to stress-test the plan?

Events: benchmark_cited

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 8 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
You know, that's a fair point about HNW CPMs running higher. Looking at our current digital efforts, we're seeing CPLs in the $400-800 range depending on channel, so $600 feels realistic but definitely on the aggressive side. I'd probably want to model a few scenarios - maybe our base case at $600, but also look at $750 and $900 per lead to see how that impacts our volume targets. If we end up at the higher end, we might need to either increase budget or adjust our lead targets down to something like 1,800-2,000 MQLs. Better to be conservative and hit our numbers than overpromise on volume.

AGENT:
Smart thinking. Let me model those scenarios:

**Base Case:** $600 CPL = 2,500 leads (your original target)
**Conservative:** $750 CPL = 2,000 leads  
**Pessimistic:** $900 CPL = 1,667 leads

At your 12-15% conversion rates:
- 2,500 leads → 300-375 clients → $540-675M AUM
- 2,000 leads → 240-300 clients → $432-540M AUM  
- 1,667 leads → 200-250 clients → $360-450M AUM

Even the conservative scenario gets you close to your $500M AUM target. The pessimistic case falls short but still delivers meaningful growth.

Given your current $400-800 CPL range across channels, the $600-750 range feels achievable with precision targeting and your strong lookalike data.

Should we plan the campaign architecture around the conservative 2,000 lead target at $750 CPL? This builds in safety margin while still hitting your core business objective.

Events: calculation_performed

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 9 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Yeah, let's go with the conservative scenario at 2,000 leads and $750 CPL. That still gets us to our $500M AUM target at the higher end of our conversion range, and it's more realistic given what we're seeing in the market. I'd rather underpromise and overdeliver than set ourselves up for disappointment. Plus, if we do hit those lower CPLs in some channels, we can always reinvest the efficiency gains to drive additional volume or expand into those other DMAs we initially cut. Building in that buffer makes sense for a precision play like this.

AGENT:
Perfect. Conservative planning at 2,000 leads and $750 CPL gives you the buffer needed for HNW precision targeting while still hitting your $500M AUM objective.

Now let's define your audience with the precision this campaign demands. You've identified strong behavioral signals, but we need 20-30 specific targeting criteria for effective HNW reach.

Beyond your core demographics (45-65, $1M+ investable assets, executives/business owners), what additional signals help you identify prospects? For example:

- Specific job titles or company revenue thresholds
- Geographic micro-targeting (zip codes, neighborhoods)  
- Behavioral indicators (financial publication readership, event attendance)
- Life event triggers (business sale filings, inheritance, divorce)

What combination of these signals has proven most predictive in your existing client acquisition?

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 10 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
For job titles, we see strong performance with C-suite executives, managing directors, partners at law/consulting firms, and business owners with companies doing $10M+ in revenue. Geographic micro-targeting is huge for us - we focus on specific zip codes with median household incomes over $200K, like the Upper East Side, Palo Alto, Lincoln Park in Chicago. 

Behavioral signals that work well include subscribers to Barron's, WSJ, and Financial Planning Magazine, plus attendance at industry conferences or wealth management seminars. The life event triggers are gold when we can identify them - recent business sale filings, stock option exercises, real estate transactions over $2M, and even divorce proceedings since that often triggers asset restructuring. Our existing client data shows people who hit 3-4 of these criteria simultaneously have conversion rates nearly double our baseline.

AGENT:
Excellent targeting precision. Your multi-signal approach with 3-4 criteria overlap driving 2x conversion rates is exactly what HNW campaigns need.

Let me organize your 20+ targeting signals:

**Professional:** C-suite, MDs, law/consulting partners, $10M+ revenue business owners
**Geographic:** $200K+ median income zip codes (Upper East Side, Palo Alto, Lincoln Park, etc.)
**Behavioral:** Barron's/WSJ/Financial Planning subscribers, wealth conference attendees
**Life Events:** Business sale filings, stock option exercises, $2M+ real estate transactions, divorce proceedings
**Intent:** Estate planning calculator usage, tax guide downloads, advisor bio engagement

Your 50K client CRM becomes powerful for creating lookalike audiences that naturally cluster these signals.

Given this precision targeting and your conservative $750 CPL planning, what channels have historically delivered your best cost-per-lead efficiency for reaching this specific audience profile?

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 11 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
LinkedIn has been our strongest performer by far - we're seeing CPLs in the $500-650 range there, and the lead quality is consistently high since we can layer in all those professional targeting criteria. Programmatic display through premium financial publishers like WSJ and Barron's runs a bit higher at $600-800 CPL, but the contextual relevance is excellent for brand safety with this audience.

Connected TV has been interesting - higher CPMs but great for building awareness in those high-income zip codes, though harder to measure direct lead attribution. We've also had success with podcast sponsorships on shows like Masters in Business and Chat with Traders, typically running $700-900 CPL but delivering highly engaged prospects. The key is making sure we can track everything back through our marketing automation platform for proper attribution across the customer journey.

AGENT:
Excellent channel performance data. LinkedIn at $500-650 CPL and premium programmatic at $600-800 CPL both align perfectly with your conservative $750 planning target.

Based on your historical performance and 2,000 lead target, here's a strategic allocation framework:

**LinkedIn (40% - $600K):** Core lead generation leveraging professional targeting
**Premium Programmatic (30% - $450K):** WSJ/Barron's contextual targeting  
**Connected TV (20% - $300K):** Awareness in high-income zip codes
**Podcast Sponsorships (10% - $150K):** High-engagement niche targeting

This projects approximately:
- LinkedIn: 1,000 leads at $600 CPL
- Programmatic: 600 leads at $750 CPL  
- Podcasts: 200 leads at $750 CPL
- CTV: Brand awareness + attribution lift

Does this allocation align with your channel preferences, or would you adjust the LinkedIn/programmatic split based on your capacity to scale those channels effectively?

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 12 (Step 8)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
That allocation looks really solid - I like the heavy weighting on LinkedIn since that's been our most reliable performer. The 40% allocation there gives us room to scale our best-converting campaigns while still diversifying risk across other channels.

I might bump programmatic up slightly to 35% and LinkedIn down to 35% just because we've had some saturation issues when we push LinkedIn spend too aggressively in a single quarter. The premium publisher placements through WSJ and Barron's have been really consistent for us, and I think we can handle that volume without hitting frequency caps. Otherwise, the CTV and podcast allocations look spot-on for building that top-of-funnel awareness we need in these concentrated markets.

AGENT:
Perfect adjustment. Avoiding LinkedIn saturation while scaling proven programmatic performance makes strategic sense.

**Revised allocation:**
- LinkedIn (35% - $525K): ~875 leads at $600 CPL
- Premium Programmatic (35% - $525K): ~700 leads at $750 CPL
- Connected TV (20% - $300K): Awareness + attribution lift
- Podcast Sponsorships (10% - $150K): ~200 leads at $750 CPL

Total: ~1,775 direct-attributed leads with CTV driving additional conversions through other channels.

Now for measurement - given your complex customer journey from awareness through multiple touchpoints to qualified lead, what's your current primary success metric? Are you optimizing campaigns toward cost-per-lead, lead-to-client conversion rates, or tracking something closer to actual AUM acquired?
