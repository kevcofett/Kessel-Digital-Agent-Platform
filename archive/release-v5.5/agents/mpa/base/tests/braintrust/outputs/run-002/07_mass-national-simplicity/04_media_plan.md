# Media Plan Output: Mass National Campaign - Simplicity Test

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect - you've given me a strong foundation. Your business outcome is driving awareness for your new snack line launch. For brand awareness campaigns, success is typically measured through metrics like aided/unaided brand awareness, consideration lift, or reach against target audience.

You mentioned brand lift studies - what specific awareness metric are you targeting? For example, are you aiming to achieve a certain percentage of aided brand awareness, or looking for a specific lift in brand consideration among your target audience?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect! 20-25% aided brand awareness is your primary KPI - that's a solid target for a new product launch. 

To assess if this is achievable with your $8M budget, I need to understand your target volume. When you say "reach as many people as possible" among adults 18-54 who buy snacks, what's your target reach? 

For context, that demographic represents roughly 120 million adults in the US. Are you aiming to reach a specific percentage of this total audience - like 50% reach, 70% reach - or do you have a target number of people you want to expose to your campaign?

Turn 3:
Let me model this for you. With adults 18-54 who buy snacks at ~120M people:

60% reach = 72M people
70% reach = 84M people

$8M / 72M = $0.11 per person reached at 60%
$8M / 84M = $0.10 per person reached at 70%

Those CPMs are extremely tight for national brand awareness - we're talking about needing sub-$2 CPMs with minimal frequency. For context, national brand campaigns typically need $15-25 per person reached to achieve meaningful awareness lift through sufficient frequency.

A more realistic target with your $8M would be 25-35% reach (30-42M people), which projects to $0.19-$0.27 per person. This allows for 3-4x frequency, which brand lift studies show is the minimum for awareness impact.

Would you be open to a more focused reach target that ensures sufficient frequency for measurable brand lift, or do we need to explore increasing budget to achieve your 60-70% reach ambition?

Turn 4:
Excellent decision! 32-35M people at 3-4x frequency gives us a much stronger foundation for measurable brand lift.

$8M / 33.5M people (midpoint) = $0.24 per person reached

This projects to realistic efficiency for national brand awareness work and aligns with what successful snack brand launches typically achieve.

Now that we have your reach target locked, I need to understand the economic logic. Brand awareness campaigns still need to connect to business value. When someone becomes aware of FreshBite through this campaign, what's the expected customer journey? 

For example, do they typically try the product within 3 months, 6 months, or is this more of a long-term brand building play where purchase might happen over 12+ months?

Turn 5:
Got it - brand building with 1-6 month trial window makes sense for snacks. Since you don't have precise customer journey data, I'll model using typical CPG benchmarks and you can refine anytime.

Based on snack category norms, I'll assume 3-5% of aware consumers trial within 6 months. At 33.5M reach with 25% aided awareness, that projects to:

33.5M × 25% = 8.4M aware consumers
8.4M × 4% trial rate = ~335K trial customers

If average customer value is $15-25 over first year (typical for premium snacks), this projects to $5-8M in trial revenue against your $8M investment.

Does this trial conversion assumption seem reasonable for your category, or should I adjust the modeling? The key is ensuring your awareness investment has a logical path to business value.

Turn 6:
Perfect! Using $25 average customer value (midpoint of your $20-30 range):

335K trial customers × $25 = $8.4M projected trial revenue

This shows your $8M awareness investment has a viable path to business value - essentially break-even on trial alone, before considering long-term customer value and brand equity building.

Your economics look solid for a brand awareness play. Now let's move to Step 3: Audience. You mentioned adults 18-54 who buy snacks, but for a $8M national campaign, we need much tighter definition to optimize efficiency.

What are the 3-4 most important characteristics that define your ideal FreshBite customer beyond age? For example, are they health-conscious parents, busy professionals, fitness enthusiasts, or specific lifestyle segments?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 7:
Excellent - that gives me three strong targeting pillars: health-conscious convenience seekers, busy lifestyles (professionals/parents), and premium shoppers ($50K+ HHI).

This significantly narrows your audience from 120M adults 18-54 to roughly 35-45M people who match all these criteria. That's actually perfect for your 32-35M reach target - it means you can achieve 75-80% reach within your ideal audience segment rather than broad reach across everyone.

One more audience question: Within that health-conscious convenience segment, are there any behavioral signals that matter most? For example, do they shop organic regularly, follow fitness/wellness content, use meal delivery services, or have other habits that would help us find them efficiently in media channels?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Perfect! Those behavioral signals paint a clear picture: organic/natural shoppers, wellness content followers, convenience service users, and better-for-you product switchers.

This gives us excellent targeting precision. Your refined audience is health-conscious convenience shoppers with premium spending power who actively seek better-for-you alternatives. At 35-45M people, we can achieve 75-80% reach within this ideal segment.

Now for Step 4: Geography. You mentioned launching nationally, but with your focused audience, are there specific markets or regions where this health-conscious convenience shopper is more concentrated? For example, do you see stronger performance in coastal markets, urban areas, or specific DMAs where your retail distribution will be strongest?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Absolutely! Aligning media investment with retail distribution is critical for brand awareness campaigns - no point driving awareness where people can't find the product.

Based on your target markets (major metros, coastal areas, college towns) and retail focus (Whole Foods, Target, premium grocery), I'd recommend a tiered geographic approach:

Tier 1 (50-60% of budget): Top 15-20 DMAs where you have strong retail presence and high audience concentration - NYC, LA, SF, Boston, DC, Chicago, Seattle, Denver, Austin
Tier 2 (25-30% of budget): Secondary metros and affluent suburbs with Target/premium grocery presence
Tier 3 (15-20% of budget): National reach to capture remaining audience

This concentrates spend where awareness can convert to trial fastest. Does your retail team have a priority DMA list, or should I model based on typical premium CPG distribution patterns?

Turn 10:
Perfect! Geographic strategy locked: 50-60% in top metros where retail and audience align, with tiered approach for maximum awareness-to-trial conversion.

Now for Step 5: Budget allocation. With your $8M total budget and tiered geography, let me model the splits:

Tier 1 markets (top metros): $4.5M (56% of budget)
Tier 2 markets (secondary): $2.2M (28% of budget) 
Tier 3 markets (national reach): $1.3M (16% of budget)

This concentrates firepower where your health-conscious convenience shoppers are densest and retail availability is strongest.

One budget question: Is this $8M purely for working media, or does it include production, creative development, and other campaign costs? The split affects how much actual media weight we can deploy.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Excellent! $8M in pure working media gives us strong firepower. Your geographic allocation is locked and loaded.

Now for Step 6: Value Proposition. For brand awareness creative to break through, we need a clear, compelling message that resonates with your health-conscious convenience shoppers.

Based on everything you've shared - premium positioning, better-for-you ingredients, convenience focus - what's the core message you want people to remember about FreshBite? Is it "healthy snacking made convenient," "premium ingredients you can trust," "better choices for busy lives," or something else entirely?

The stronger this value prop, the more efficiently your $8M will build awareness and consideration.

Turn 12:
Perfect! "Snacking without compromise" is a powerful value prop that directly addresses your audience's core tension. It positions FreshBite as the solution to their daily dilemma - no more choosing between taste and health.

That message will resonate strongly with your health-conscious convenience shoppers who are tired of making trade-offs. "Fuel your busy life the right way" works beautifully as supporting messaging that adds the convenience angle.

Now we're ready for Step 7: Channels. With your $8M budget, brand awareness objective, and "no compromise" positioning, we need channels that can deliver both reach and emotional connection to build that 20-25% aided awareness.

Given your target audience of health-conscious convenience shoppers and tiered geographic strategy, what channels are you already considering, or do you want me to recommend the optimal mix for maximum awareness impact?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 13:
Excellent channel thinking! Your instincts are spot-on for brand awareness. Let me recommend an optimal mix for your $8M:

**TV/CTV (45-50% | $3.6-4M):** Backbone for reach and emotional storytelling. Your "snacking without compromise" message needs that full creative canvas.

**YouTube (20-25% | $1.6-2M):** Perfect for your wellness content consumers. Pre-roll and in-stream video where they're already engaged with health/lifestyle content.

**Streaming Audio (15-20% | $1.2-1.6M):** Smart call - captures busy professionals during commutes and workouts. Great frequency builder.

**Display/Video (10-15% | $0.8-1.2M):** Reach extension and retargeting support.

This mix should deliver your 32-35M reach target at 3-4x frequency. TV/CTV and YouTube handle the heavy lifting for awareness, while audio catches your audience during high-engagement moments.

Does this allocation feel right, or would you want to shift investment toward any particular channel based on where you think your audience is most receptive?
