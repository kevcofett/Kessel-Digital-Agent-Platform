# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience Unified Media Plan

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've provided excellent segment detail that we'll leverage heavily in Step 3. First, let's establish your foundation.

$3M budget targeting 25,000 enrollees projects to $120 per enrollment across all segments. That's efficient for insurance acquisition.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve beyond enrollment volume? For example, are you focused on total premium revenue, member retention at 12 months, or market share growth in specific regions?

Turn 2:
Perfect. Premium revenue growth with segment-specific LTV profiles gives us much better targeting precision than enrollment alone.

To model this properly, I need to understand the revenue potential. What's the typical annual premium value for each segment? For example, if Young Professionals average $2,400 annually, Families $4,800, and Pre-Medicare $6,000, that helps us allocate budget based on revenue impact rather than just enrollment volume.

Do you have approximate annual premium ranges for your three segments?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Perfect. Now I can model the full LTV picture:

**Lifetime Value by Segment:**
- Young Professionals: $2,800 × 2.5 years = $7,000 LTV
- Families: $5,200 × 4.5 years = $23,400 LTV  
- Pre-Medicare: $5,800 × 3.5 years = $20,300 LTV

**LTV/CAC Ratios at $120 blended:**
- Young Professionals: 58x
- Families: 195x
- Pre-Medicare: 169x

This reveals Families as your highest-value segment by far, followed closely by Pre-Medicare. These ratios suggest your $120 blended CAC is quite conservative - there's likely room for more aggressive acquisition, especially for Families and Pre-Medicare.

Is this $120 per enrollment a hard constraint, or could you invest more per customer if the segment economics justify it?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent. Let me model the revenue implications:

**Annual Premium by Segment:**
- Young Professionals: $2,800
- Families: $5,200  
- Pre-Medicare: $5,800

At your $120 blended acquisition cost, you're looking at strong efficiency ratios:
- Young Professionals: 23x first-year premium/CAC
- Families: 43x first-year premium/CAC  
- Pre-Medicare: 48x first-year premium/CAC

These are healthy ratios for insurance acquisition. However, your mention of "very different LTV profiles" suggests retention varies significantly between segments.

What's the typical member lifespan for each segment? For instance, do Young Professionals stay 3-4 years while Pre-Medicare stays 8-10 years until Medicare eligibility?

Turn 5:
Excellent strategic thinking. Let me model your refined CAC allocation:

**Proposed CAC by Segment:**
- Young Professionals: $80 (100x LTV/CAC)
- Families: $140 (167x LTV/CAC)  
- Pre-Medicare: $130 (156x LTV/CAC)

This creates much better value alignment while maintaining exceptional efficiency ratios across all segments.

**Budget Implications:**
If we maintain 25,000 total enrollments but weight toward higher-value segments, your budget allocation becomes more strategic. For example, targeting 8,000 Young Professionals, 10,000 Families, and 7,000 Pre-Medicare would total $2.67M, leaving $330K for testing and optimization.

Does this enrollment distribution align with your market opportunity and capacity to serve each segment effectively?

Turn 6:
Perfect. Your segment allocation balances opportunity with value creation effectively. Let me confirm our economics foundation:

**Final Economics Model:**
- Young Professionals: 8,000 × $80 = $640K
- Families: 10,000 × $140 = $1,400K  
- Pre-Medicare: 7,000 × $130 = $910K
- **Total: $2.95M with $50K buffer**

This creates a value-weighted approach that maximizes premium revenue while maintaining strong efficiency ratios across all segments.

Now let's move to Step 3: Audience Definition. You provided excellent segment frameworks upfront, but I need to understand targeting precision for each.

Starting with Young Professionals - beyond age 26-35 and urban metros, what behavioral or lifestyle signals best identify your ideal prospects? For example, do fitness app usage, recent job changes, or specific income thresholds improve targeting accuracy?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 8:
Perfect. That builds a comprehensive Family profile:

**Family Targeting:**
- Ages 35-50, suburban markets around top 50 metros
- Parents with kids under 18
- Life event triggers: new babies, school-age kids, job changes
- Kids in youth sports + ongoing pediatric care
- Income $75K-$150K (above subsidy thresholds, cost-conscious)
- Currently on high-deductible plans seeking predictability

The life event targeting and current plan dissatisfaction signals should drive strong conversion rates.

For Pre-Medicare - you mentioned ages 55-64 with geographic concentration in FL, AZ, TX. What signals beyond age and location identify prospects most likely to prioritize network quality and stability over price?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Excellent targeting signals. That creates a precise Young Professional profile:

**Young Professional Targeting:**
- Ages 26-35, urban metros (NYC, SF, LA, Chicago)
- Fitness/health app users + gym members
- Recent job transitions (corporate to startup/freelance)
- Income $45K-$85K
- Recent metro relocations
- Individual coverage need

These behavioral signals should significantly improve your targeting precision beyond basic demographics.

For Families - you mentioned suburban markets around top 50 metros with kids under 18. What additional signals help identify families most likely to switch health plans? Are there life events, current plan frustrations, or household characteristics that predict conversion?

Turn 9:
Excellent. That completes your Pre-Medicare profile:

**Pre-Medicare Targeting:**
- Ages 55-64, concentrated in FL, AZ, TX
- Active retirement planning (Medicare research, seminars)
- Existing health conditions requiring specialist continuity
- Income $60K+ individual / $90K+ couples
- Early retirees or COBRA recipients
- Priority on network stability over cost

All three segments now have precise behavioral and circumstantial targeting beyond demographics.

Moving to Step 4: Geography. You've identified urban metros for Young Professionals, suburban rings for Families, and FL/AZ/TX concentration for Pre-Medicare. 

Are there specific DMAs or metropolitan areas where your provider networks are strongest, or markets where competitor weakness creates opportunity for aggressive targeting?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Perfect. This creates clear geographic priorities by segment:

**Geographic Strategy:**
- **Young Professionals:** SF/Seattle (underperforming vs. network strength), continue Chicago/Denver success
- **Families:** Suburban rings around Dallas, Atlanta, Denver + Miami-Dade suburbs (competitor gaps)
- **Pre-Medicare:** Texas triangle (Dallas/Houston/Austin), Phoenix, Tampa/Orlando (network strength)

The overlap in Dallas and Denver markets creates efficiency opportunities for cross-segment campaigns.

Moving to Step 5: Budget Allocation. With your $2.95M total budget, how should we weight investment between your priority markets? For instance, should Texas get heavier investment given it works for both Pre-Medicare and Families, or do the SF/Seattle opportunity markets for Young Professionals deserve premium allocation?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Excellent allocation strategy. Let me model your geographic budget distribution:

**Geographic Budget Allocation:**
- Texas triangle (Multi-segment): 32.5% = $960K
- SF/Seattle (Young Professionals): 20% = $590K  
- Atlanta/Denver suburbs (Families): 25% = $740K
- Phoenix/Florida (Pre-Medicare): 20% = $590K
- Reserve/Testing: 2.5% = $70K

This weights investment toward your highest-opportunity markets while maintaining testing capacity.

**Cross-Segment Texas Strategy:** Your Texas investment can efficiently target Pre-Medicare statewide plus suburban Families around Dallas, with shared network quality messaging reducing creative costs.

Moving to Step 6: Value Proposition. Each segment needs different messaging despite some network quality overlap. What's the primary value driver for Young Professionals - is it convenience, price transparency, digital experience, or something else?
