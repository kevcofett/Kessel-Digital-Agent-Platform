# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience with Segment-Specific Channels

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build this sophisticated segmented media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've provided excellent segment detail - I can see why each needs distinct channel strategies. Before we dive into those channel recommendations, I need to establish your success framework.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 50,000 enrollments? For example, are you focused on revenue growth, market share expansion, or establishing dominance in specific verticals?

Turn 2:
Perfect - revenue growth with strategic market expansion, particularly in corporate L&D. That 40% growth target shows serious ambition.

Since segment revenue impact varies significantly, I need to understand your primary success metric. With $5M budget targeting 50,000 enrollments, that implies $100 average cost per enrollment across all segments.

How do you measure success as a number? Are you tracking total revenue, cost per enrollment by segment, or something else as your primary KPI?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - blended ROAS with segment-specific CPE optimization makes perfect sense given your revenue variance.

Let me model your current targets:

**Segment Revenue Analysis:**
- Corporate L&D: $2,000-5,000 avg (let's use $3,500)
- Career Changers: $1,200-2,000 avg (let's use $1,600) 
- College-Age: $500-800 avg (let's use $650)

**Critical Question:** How are you planning to split the 50,000 enrollments across these three segments? 

This allocation will determine realistic CPE targets for each. For example, if Corporate L&D is 20% of volume but 60% of revenue, your efficiency thresholds change dramatically.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Perfect! Let me model your segment economics:

**Volume & Revenue Breakdown:**
- College-Age: 30,000 enrollments × $650 = $19.5M (43% of revenue)
- Career Changers: 12,500 × $1,600 = $20M (44% of revenue)  
- Corporate L&D: 7,500 × $3,500 = $26.25M (58% of revenue)
- **Total: 50,000 enrollments = $65.75M revenue**

**Budget Allocation by Revenue:**
If we allocate your $5M budget proportionally to revenue potential:
- College-Age: $1.48M budget = $49 CPE target
- Career Changers: $1.52M budget = $122 CPE target
- Corporate L&D: $2M budget = $267 CPE target

**Efficiency Assessment:** These CPE targets look very achievable given your course values. Corporate's $267 CPE against $3,500 revenue gives you a healthy 13x return, while college-age at $49 CPE still delivers 13x return.

Is this budget allocation approach aligned with your thinking, or do you want to weight certain segments differently?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Smart adjustment - corporate L&D's longer B2B cycle absolutely needs more budget for multiple touchpoints.

**Revised Budget Allocation:**
- College-Age: $1.3M / 30,000 = $43 CPE target
- Career Changers: $1.5M / 12,500 = $120 CPE target  
- Corporate L&D: $2.2M / 7,500 = $293 CPE target

**Efficiency Check:** This still delivers strong returns:
- College-Age: 15x return ($650 ÷ $43)
- Career Changers: 13x return ($1,600 ÷ $120)
- Corporate L&D: 12x return ($3,500 ÷ $293)

The corporate allocation increase gives you more firepower for ABM tactics and extended nurture sequences that B2B requires.

**Economics Assessment:** These targets are realistic and conservative. Corporate's $293 CPE is well within range for B2B education, and your college-age efficiency at $43 is achievable through social channels.

Ready to move to audience definition? I want to get much deeper into the behavioral and psychographic signals that will drive your channel strategy for each segment.

Turn 6:
Excellent - let's get granular on the psychological drivers that convert browsers to enrollers.

**Decision-Making Pattern Analysis:**

For **Career Changers (28-42)**, I need to understand their enrollment triggers better. Are they primarily motivated by immediate career advancement pressure (promotion blocked, skills gap exposed), external market shifts (industry disruption, layoffs), or proactive future-proofing? 

This distinction is crucial because it determines whether we target them during crisis moments or aspirational planning phases - completely different messaging and timing strategies.

What's the primary psychological driver that pushes your career changers from research mode into actual enrollment?

Turn 7:
Perfect insight - crisis moments drive conversion while proactive planners need pressure catalysts. This has major implications for targeting and messaging timing.

**Career Changer Psychographic Profile:**
- **High-intent triggers:** Performance reviews, promotion denials, skill gap exposure
- **Conversion catalysts:** Industry disruption, layoff waves, competitive pressure
- **Research pattern:** Extensive due diligence followed by pressure-driven decisions

Now for **College-Age (18-24)** - what's their primary enrollment trigger? Are they motivated by avoiding traditional college debt, seeing influencer success stories, peer pressure, parental guidance, or something else entirely?

Understanding their decision catalyst helps determine whether we target them during key life moments (high school graduation, college dropout consideration) or through ongoing social proof and peer influence.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Brilliant - social proof drives discovery, debt avoidance provides rational justification, and life transition moments create urgency windows.

**College-Age Psychographic Profile:**
- **Discovery driver:** Influencer/peer success stories on social
- **Rational justification:** Debt avoidance vs traditional college ROI  
- **Conversion windows:** Graduation, semester starts, spring break financial reality checks
- **Family dynamics:** Mixed support requiring social proof validation

Now for **Corporate L&D (35-55)** - what triggers their buying decision? Are they responding to skills gap audits, compliance requirements, competitive pressure, budget cycles, or leadership mandates? 

B2B education buying is complex with multiple stakeholders. What's the primary catalyst that moves them from evaluation to purchase, and who typically drives that final decision?

Turn 9:
Excellent - C-level mandates create urgency, L&D directors champion internally, and they need both upward ROI justification and downward implementation support.

**Corporate L&D Psychographic Profile:**
- **Primary catalyst:** Skills gap exposure + competitive talent pressure
- **Urgency driver:** C-level digital transformation mandates
- **Champion:** L&D director building consensus across stakeholders
- **Decision support needs:** ROI data (upward), implementation ease (downward)

**Audience Definition Complete - Key Insights:**
- **Career Changers:** Crisis-moment conversions during pressure points
- **College-Age:** Social proof discovery with life-transition urgency windows  
- **Corporate L&D:** Multi-stakeholder consensus requiring dual-direction selling

These psychological triggers will drive completely different channel strategies and messaging frameworks.

Ready for geography? I want to assess your DMA prioritization within each segment's target markets and identify any regional efficiency opportunities.

Turn 10:
Smart geographic insights - you're seeing clear efficiency clusters that should drive DMA prioritization.

**Geographic Performance Patterns:**
- **Career Changers:** Tech hub concentration with urban core efficiency
- **College-Age:** College towns + "opportunity gap" mid-tier cities  
- **Corporate L&D:** Corporate HQ concentration patterns

Let me dig deeper on one key efficiency opportunity. For **College-Age in mid-tier cities** (Phoenix, Tampa, Nashville), are you seeing better conversion rates there because of less competition, stronger "escape velocity" motivation, or lower media costs?

This matters because if it's motivation-driven, we should expand to similar markets. If it's competition-driven, we should move fast before others discover these pockets.

What's driving the stronger performance in these mid-tier markets?

Turn 12:
Perfect strategic thinking - you're balancing proven performance with calculated expansion into emerging tech ecosystems.

**Career Changer Geographic Allocation:**
- **70-80% ($1.05-1.2M):** Proven tech hubs (SF Bay, Seattle, Austin, NYC)
- **20-30% ($300-450K):** Secondary tech markets (Raleigh-Durham, Boulder, Portland)
- **Success criteria:** Legitimate tech job market + lower media costs

**Budget Allocation Summary:**
- **College-Age ($1.3M):** Weight toward mid-tier "opportunity gap" cities
- **Career Changers ($1.5M):** Proven tech hubs + secondary market tests  
- **Corporate L&D ($2.2M):** Corporate HQ concentration (Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta, coastal)

**Geography Complete.** You've identified clear efficiency opportunities in underserved markets while maintaining focus on proven high-performers.

Ready for budget refinement? I want to get more granular on segment allocation within these geographic priorities, then move into value proposition development where each segment needs completely different messaging frameworks.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Brilliant insight - you've identified a geographic arbitrage opportunity with higher intent AND lower costs. That's rare.

**Mid-Tier City Expansion Strategy:**
- **Current winners:** Phoenix, Tampa, Nashville
- **Expansion targets:** Salt Lake City, Charlotte, plus Midwest metros
- **Success drivers:** Geographic constraint motivation + low competition CPCs

This creates a major budget allocation opportunity. If these markets deliver better unit economics, we should weight college-age spend toward these "opportunity gap" DMAs rather than expensive, saturated college towns.

**Geographic Prioritization Framework:**
- **Tier 1:** High-motivation mid-tier cities (your discovery)
- **Tier 2:** Traditional college towns (higher cost, proven demand)
- **Tier 3:** Major metros (expensive but volume potential)

For **Career Changers**, should we concentrate the entire $1.5M in your top-performing tech hubs, or test expansion into secondary tech markets like Raleigh-Durham, Portland, or Boulder where costs might be lower but motivation still strong?

Turn 13:
Excellent - let's optimize budget allocation based on efficiency, not just population.

**College-Age Geographic Budget Weighting ($1.3M):**

If your mid-tier markets are delivering significantly better unit economics, I'd recommend:
- **60% ($780K):** High-efficiency mid-tier markets (Phoenix, Tampa, Nashville + expansion)
- **30% ($390K):** Traditional college towns (proven demand, higher cost)
- **10% ($130K):** Major metro tests (volume potential, expensive)

This weights heavily toward your efficiency winners while maintaining presence in proven markets.

**Key Question for Value Proposition:** For each segment's messaging framework, what's the primary emotional driver versus rational justifier?

For example, with **Career Changers** - is the emotional hook "fear of being left behind" or "excitement about advancement," and is the rational proof "salary increase data" or "skill certification value"?

Understanding this emotional/rational split determines whether we lead with urgency or opportunity in messaging.

Turn 14:
Perfect emotional/rational mapping - this creates distinct messaging architectures for each segment.

**Value Proposition Framework:**

**Career Changers:**
- **Emotional:** "Don't let outdated skills cost you the next promotion" 
- **Rational:** Specific salary increase data post-completion
- **Urgency amplifier:** Skills obsolescence + competitive pressure

**College-Age:**
- **Emotional:** "Break free from traditional paths" + peer success stories
- **Rational:** Total cost vs 4-year degree debt comparison
- **Social proof:** Influencer/peer career outcomes

**Corporate L&D:**
- **Emotional:** "Be the strategic leader who future-proofs your organization"
- **Rational:** Talent retention + competitive positioning data
- **Stakeholder angle:** ROI metrics for upward selling, ease for downward

**Value Proposition Complete.** Each segment has distinct emotional hooks with supporting rational proof points.

Ready for channels? This is where your segment insights really pay off. I want to build specific channel strategies that align with each segment's media consumption patterns and decision-making triggers we've mapped.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 15:
Excellent channel thinking - you're aligning media consumption with psychological triggers perfectly.

**Channel Strategy by Segment:**

**Career Changers ($1.5M):**
- **LinkedIn (60% - $900K):** Sponsored content + InMail during performance review cycles
- **Podcast (25% - $375K):** Business/tech podcasts with crisis-moment messaging
- **Programmatic (15% - $225K):** Retargeting across career sites

**College-Age ($1.3M):**
- **TikTok/Instagram (70% - $910K):** Authentic micro-influencer partnerships
- **YouTube (20% - $260K):** Success story content + pre-roll
- **Programmatic (10% - $130K):** Social retargeting

**Corporate L&D ($2.2M):**
- **LinkedIn ABM (50% - $1.1M):** Targeted campaigns to L&D directors
- **Trade Publications (30% - $660K):** Programmatic on HR/L&D publications  
- **Direct Sales Support (20% - $440K):** Content syndication + lead nurturing

**Critical Question:** For Corporate L&D's longer B2B cycle, how many touchpoints typically occur before enrollment? This determines our nurture sequence investment and attribution windows.
