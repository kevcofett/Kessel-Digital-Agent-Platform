# Media Plan Output: High-Stakes Performance Campaign

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've given me great foundational data. Let me quickly analyze what you've shared:

$2M ÷ 50,000 merchants = $40 CAC target
With $850 LTV, that's a strong 21x LTV/CAC ratio

Your efficiency target looks very achievable for B2B fintech. Now, what specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 50,000 new merchants? For example, are you focused on total payment volume processed, expanding into new verticals, or hitting a specific revenue milestone?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect! So your primary objective is ARR growth through merchant acquisition, with 50,000 new merchants driving $42M in additional ARR. That's roughly $840 average revenue per merchant, which aligns well with your $850 LTV.

Your $40 CAC target is conservative for B2B fintech - most platforms in your space see $60-120 CAC based on industry benchmarks. This gives you solid efficiency cushion or room to be more aggressive if needed.

Quick validation: $42M additional ARR from 50,000 merchants suggests strong unit economics. Is this $840 average based on first-year revenue, or does it include some multi-year projection? This helps me assess if your $40 CAC assumption accounts for the right payback period.

Turn 3:
Excellent - that clarifies the economics perfectly. First-year ARR of $840 with 3-year LTV of $850 is actually quite conservative, suggesting most value comes in year one with strong retention.

At $40 CAC against $840 first-year revenue, you're looking at roughly 1.5 month payback assuming typical fintech margins. That's extremely healthy and gives you significant room to be more aggressive.

Let me model a scenario: If you pushed CAC to $60 (still conservative for B2B fintech), that would give you a $3M budget capacity while maintaining excellent unit economics. 

$3M ÷ 50,000 = $60 CAC
Still delivers 14x LTV/CAC ratio and sub-3 month payback

Given your growth milestones and geographic expansion goals, would you consider increasing the budget to accelerate acquisition, or do you prefer to optimize within the $2M constraint first?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Perfect - that quality focus will drive much better long-term outcomes. Let me model this:

55,000 total signups to get 50,000 qualified merchants = 91% qualification rate
$2M ÷ 55,000 total signups = $36 CAC for all signups
$2M ÷ 50,000 qualified merchants = $40 CAC for qualified merchants

Your blended success metric makes sense: 70% weight on qualified merchant count, 30% on first-quarter transaction volume.

So your primary KPI is "qualified merchants who process $15K+ in first 90 days" with a target of 50,000. This is smart - it ensures you're acquiring merchants who actually drive meaningful ARR.

One quick economics check: At 28% margins, does the $15K minimum threshold merchants typically generate enough gross profit to justify the $40 acquisition cost? I want to make sure the qualification bar aligns with your unit economics before we move to audience definition.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 4:
Got it - $2M is your constraint, and at 28% margins you need to be capital efficient. Let me recalculate with your margin data:

$2M ÷ 50,000 = $40 CAC
$840 first-year ARR × 28% margin = $235 gross profit
$235 ÷ $40 = 5.9 month payback period

That's still very healthy for B2B fintech, where 6-12 month paybacks are typical. Your conservative LTV modeling gives you good downside protection.

The mid-year budget expansion strategy makes sense - Q1 performance data will strengthen your case for additional funding.

Now let's define your primary success metric. Is it simply hitting 50,000 new merchants, or do you want to track a blended metric that accounts for both volume and quality? For example, some fintechs track "qualified merchants" or weight by first-90-day transaction volume to ensure you're not just hitting numbers but acquiring merchants who actually use the platform.

Turn 6:
Excellent - those economics are rock solid. $470 gross profit against $40 CAC equals 2.5 month payback, which is outstanding for B2B fintech.

Perfect, we've established strong Step 1 and 2 foundations:
- **Objective**: 50,000 qualified merchants processing $15K+ in first 90 days
- **Economics**: $40 CAC with 2.5 month payback on qualified merchants
- **Total volume**: 55,000 signups needed for 50,000 qualified

Your conservative modeling and quality focus set you up well for sustainable growth and potential mid-year budget expansion.

Now let's move to Step 3 - Audience. For merchant acquisition, we need to get precise about who converts best. What defines your ideal merchant profile? Are you targeting specific business types, revenue ranges, or other characteristics that correlate with hitting that $15K first-90-day threshold?
