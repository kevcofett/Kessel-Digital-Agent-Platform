# Media Plan Output: Precision Targeting with Complex Attributes

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build this precision media plan with you. Your HNW focus demands surgical targeting - exactly the right approach. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks.

Your setup is impressive: $1.5M budget, 2,500 qualified leads, and 50K client records for modeling. That projects to $600 per qualified lead - aggressive but achievable for HNW given typical conversion values.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve beyond lead generation? For example, are you targeting a specific AUM growth number, new client acquisition target, or revenue goal from these leads?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your objective is acquiring 200-250 new HNW clients, with 2,500 qualified leads as the pathway there. Your 8-10% conversion rate assumption aligns well with quality wealth management funnels.

Let me model this: 2,500 leads converting at 8-10% = 200-250 clients. At $2-3M average AUM per client, that projects to $400M-750M in new assets - right in your target range.

For your primary success KPI, what number will you track most closely? Is it the 2,500 qualified leads, the 200-250 new clients, or a specific AUM milestone like $500M? This determines how we measure and optimize the campaign.

Turn 4:
That qualification threshold is excellent - consultation scheduling within 30 days eliminates tire-kickers completely. You're right that $600 CPL could be conservative for this level of qualification.

Based on wealth management benchmarks, qualified leads with your criteria typically cost $800-1,200 in competitive HNW markets. Your $600 target suggests either exceptional targeting precision or potential budget constraints.

Let me assess feasibility: If market reality pushes CPL toward $900, you'd generate ~1,650 leads instead of 2,500 with your $1.5M budget. At your 8-10% conversion rate, that's still 130-165 new clients with $260M-495M AUM - substantial but below your targets.

Are you comfortable with this trade-off, or should we model scenarios where budget flexes upward to hit the full 2,500 lead target?

Turn 6:
Excellent behavioral intelligence. Tax-loss harvesting, charitable giving, and succession planning are perfect pre-conversion signals - they indicate serious wealth management intent, not just casual browsing.

The LinkedIn executive/business owner activity plus premium financial publication consumption creates a strong behavioral profile. Estate attorney and CPA research is particularly valuable - that's active planning behavior that suggests immediate need.

Given your first-party data richness, how granular can you get with the lookalike modeling? Can you segment your 50K client base by characteristics like acquisition channel, time-to-convert, or lifetime value to create different lookalike tiers? 

This would let us build precision audiences - for example, lookalikes based on your fastest-converting clients versus your highest-LTV clients - and test which profiles deliver the best qualified lead rates.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - 2,500 qualified leads as your primary KPI gives us clear optimization direction with fast feedback loops. Smart to separate media performance from sales execution.

Now let's validate the economics. $1.5M budget ÷ 2,500 leads = $600 per qualified lead. 

For HNW wealth management, this is aggressive but achievable with precision targeting. However, I need to understand your lead qualification criteria. When you say "qualified lead," what specific actions or characteristics define that? For example, is it someone who books a consultation, completes a detailed financial assessment, or meets certain asset thresholds through form responses?

This definition directly impacts whether $600 CPL is realistic or needs adjustment.

Turn 5:
Smart approach - exhaust efficiency opportunities before increasing budget. Your 50K client database is a massive advantage for lookalike modeling, and contextual placements in premium financial publications should deliver higher intent at better rates.

$1.5M at $600 CPL = 2,500 leads (your target)
$1.5M at $900 CPL = 1,667 leads (contingency scenario)

Your first-party data could absolutely keep you in the $600-700 range with precision execution. Let's proceed with the $600 target and build contingencies.

Economics complete. Now for audience precision - this is where your plan will succeed or fail.

Beyond the $1M+ assets and 45-65 age range, what behavioral signals best identify your ideal prospects? For example, do they typically research specific topics, engage with certain content types, or show particular online behaviors that correlate with your highest-converting clients?

Turn 7:
Perfect segmentation strategy. Four distinct lookalike tiers with clear optimization logic:

1. **Fast Converters** (<90 days): Immediate lead velocity
2. **High AUM** ($5M+): Premium unit economics, longer cycles  
3. **High Engagement**: Service utilization + referral activity
4. **Referral Sources**: Your most satisfied clients

This allows precision testing - we can optimize fast converters for volume, high-AUM for efficiency, and referral sources for quality. The engagement tier gives us a middle ground for scale.

With your 10 target DMAs (NYC, SF, LA, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Denver, Miami, Dallas, DC), should we weight budget allocation by HNW population density, or do you have performance data showing certain markets convert better for LuxeFinance specifically? 

For example, does your CRM data reveal whether NYC prospects behave differently than Denver prospects in terms of conversion rates or sales cycle length?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 9:
Perfect tactical thinking. The 40/60 flip prioritizes proving the campaign quickly - smart for securing that budget increase.

**Revised Allocation:**
- **40% Tier 1** (NYC, SF, Boston, Seattle): $600K for premium unit economics
- **50% Tier 2** (Denver, Dallas, Miami): $750K for fast optimization feedback  
- **10% Tier 3** (Chicago, LA, DC): $150K for classification testing

This gives you $750K in your fastest-converting markets for early validation, while maintaining meaningful investment in your highest-value markets. The 10% test allocation for Chicago/LA/DC should generate enough data to classify them properly.

Geography strategy complete. Now for your $1.5M budget allocation - should we break this down by audience tier (fast converters vs. high-AUM lookalikes) within each market, or do you prefer to start with broader lookalike audiences and optimize toward the best-performing segments once we have initial data?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Excellent market intelligence. This creates a clear tier structure:

**Tier 1 (Premium):** NYC, SF, Boston, Seattle - Higher CPL ($700-900) but $3-4M AUM, longer cycles
**Tier 2 (Velocity):** Denver, Dallas, Miami - Target CPL ($500-650), $2-2.5M AUM, faster conversion
**Tier 3:** Chicago, LA, DC - Need more data to classify

The velocity markets offer faster feedback for optimization while premium markets deliver better lifetime economics. Smart to weight by HNW density plus your conversion data rather than pure population.

For budget allocation, I'd suggest starting with 60% to Tier 1 markets (where your unit economics are strongest) and 40% to Tier 2 (where you can optimize faster). Does this weighting align with your growth priorities, or do you need more immediate lead velocity to justify the campaign internally?

Turn 10:
Excellent approach - broad launch for statistical significance, then data-driven optimization. Three primary lookalike tiers across all markets gives you clean test structure without over-fragmentation.

**Initial Structure:**
- Fast Converters, High-AUM, High Engagement lookalikes
- Equal allocation across tiers initially (~$500K each)
- 30-45 day performance window for optimization decisions
- Referral source lookalikes as expansion tier based on results

This balances speed-to-insight with testing rigor. Your 30-45 day evaluation window aligns perfectly with your velocity markets' conversion cycles.

Budget allocation complete. Now for value proposition - this is critical for HNW audiences who evaluate expertise heavily.

What specific value proposition will differentiate LuxeFinance in your creative messaging? Given your audience researches tax optimization and estate planning, are you positioning as comprehensive wealth management, specialized tax strategy, or something else that leverages your unique strengths?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 11:
"Precision wealth orchestration" is brilliant positioning - you're not competing with their existing advisors, you're elevating the entire ecosystem. The strategic quarterback metaphor resonates perfectly with executives who understand coordination complexity.

Your proof points are compelling: $200K+ annual tax savings and $2M+ legacy preservation are concrete outcomes that justify premium fees. The integration layer concept differentiates you from traditional wealth managers trying to own every relationship.

This value prop works beautifully with your behavioral targeting - prospects researching estate attorneys and CPAs are already experiencing the coordination challenge you solve.

For creative execution, should we lead with the orchestration concept and specific savings examples, or does your testing suggest HNW audiences respond better to outcome-first messaging before the methodology explanation? Your audience is sophisticated enough to appreciate the strategic complexity, but I want to ensure we hook them immediately.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 12:
Perfect - outcome-first with peer proof points. "How One Executive Saved $240K..." immediately establishes credibility and relevance. HNW audiences want to see measurable results from someone in their situation before considering methodology.

Your case study approach leverages social proof effectively - executives trust peer validation over vendor claims. The specific dollar amounts ($240K, $2M) create concrete value anchors that justify engagement.

A/B testing outcome-first versus methodology-first makes sense, but your historical data gives us a strong starting hypothesis.

Value proposition complete. Now for channels - this is where precision targeting meets your first-party data advantage.

Given your audience behaviors (LinkedIn executive groups, WSJ/Barron's/Forbes consumption, estate attorney research), which channels should anchor your media mix? Are you thinking LinkedIn as primary with contextual placements in financial publications, or do you see search capturing intent when they're actively researching wealth management solutions?
