# Media Plan Output: Mass National Campaign - Simplicity Test

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

For your national snack line launch, I need to understand the specific business outcome you're targeting. Brand awareness is the approach, but what's the underlying business goal - are you looking to drive trial purchases, establish market share, support retail distribution, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Trial purchases and market share establishment with retail velocity support - that's a clear business outcome. 

Now I need to understand how you'll measure success with numbers. You mentioned brand lift studies for awareness, but what's your primary success metric? Are you tracking trial purchase volume (like number of first-time buyers), market share percentage, retail velocity metrics, or something else that gives you a specific number to hit?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Great - trial purchase volume as your primary KPI makes perfect sense for a launch. 

What's your specific target for first-time buyers in those first six months? This number will help me assess if your $8M budget can realistically drive the trial volume you need.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Let me check the math on your targets:

$8M budget ÷ 2.5M first-time buyers = $3.20 per trial customer

That's an extremely efficient target - much lower than typical brand awareness campaigns. Based on industry benchmarks, driving trial for a new snack brand typically costs $15-40 per first-time buyer when factoring in the awareness-to-trial conversion funnel.

Your $3.20 target suggests either very high campaign efficiency or that significant trial will come from non-media drivers like sampling, promotions, or organic discovery at retail.

Is your $8M purely for paid media, or does it include sampling programs, in-store promotions, or other trial-driving activities? Understanding this will help me assess if the efficiency target is achievable.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Based on your $8M paid media budget, here's more realistic modeling:

**Conservative scenario:** $8M could drive approximately 200K-400K trial customers ($20-40 per trial)
**Optimistic scenario:** $8M could drive approximately 500K-650K trial customers ($12-16 per trial)

The optimistic scenario assumes strong creative, tight audience targeting, and good retail availability timing. Even that puts you at 500K-650K trials, well below your 2.5M target.

To hit 2.5M trials through paid media alone would typically require $30M-60M in spend for a new brand launch.

However, your integrated approach could work. If paid media drives awareness and consideration, then your sampling, promotions, and retail presence convert those aware consumers to trial, you might bridge that gap.

What's your assumption about how many aware consumers will convert to trial through your non-media programs?

Turn 6:
Your instinct about 30-40M reach is solid - $8M can definitely achieve that for a national campaign.

For conversion rates, here are typical benchmarks:
- **In-store sampling:** 15-25% of people who sample will purchase
- **Promotional pricing:** 3-8% of aware consumers will trial during promotion
- **Organic shelf conversion:** 0.5-2% of aware consumers trial without additional incentive

If you reach 35M people and layer in sampling + promotions strategically, you could model something like:
- 500K people sample → 100K trial purchases (20% conversion)
- 10M see promotions → 500K trial purchases (5% conversion)  
- 25M aware but no direct incentive → 250K trial purchases (1% conversion)

That projects to roughly 850K trials - much closer to realistic but still below your 2.5M target.

The gap suggests you may need to either increase paid media budget, expand sampling/promotion programs, or adjust the trial target. Which of these feels most feasible for your launch strategy?

Turn 7:
Excellent - 850K trials is a much more defensible target that aligns with your budget reality. Smart thinking on expanding sampling programs given those strong conversion rates.

Now let's move to Step 2 and assess your economics. With $8M budget targeting 850K trials, that's approximately $9.40 per trial customer - a realistic efficiency for brand awareness driving trial.

To validate this is achievable, I need to understand your unit economics. What's the average purchase value when someone tries your snacks for the first time, and what's your gross margin on that initial purchase?

Turn 8:
I'll model using your estimates and we can refine anytime. At $5 average purchase with 45% gross margin, that's roughly $2.25 gross profit per trial customer.

Your $9.40 cost per trial versus $2.25 gross profit means you're investing about 4x the immediate gross profit to acquire each trial customer. This is typical for brand launches where the real value comes from repeat purchases and long-term customer relationships.

The economics work if trial customers become repeat buyers. Do you have any sense of repeat purchase rates or customer lifetime value expectations for your category? Even rough estimates help validate whether this investment level makes sense for building your brand.

Turn 9:
Exactly right - the repeat business transforms the economics completely. Let me show the math:

**Year 1 repeat value:** 200K loyal customers × 5 purchases × $5 × 45% margin = $2.25M gross profit from repeats

**Total Year 1 gross profit:** $1.9M (trial) + $2.25M (repeat) = $4.15M gross profit vs $8M investment

That's a 52% gross profit return in Year 1, which is solid for a brand launch. Factor in Year 2+ repeat purchases and you're likely looking at positive ROI.

Your economics are defensible - the $9.40 trial cost is an investment in building a customer base that pays back through loyalty.

Perfect! We've validated your outcomes and economics work. Now let's move to Step 3: Audience. You mentioned adults 18-54 who buy snacks, but for $8M efficiency, we need much tighter targeting. What specific signals beyond age define your ideal trial customer?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Perfect! Those are much stronger targeting signals. Let me build on what you've shared:

**Behavioral:** Premium snack buyers, frequent Target/Walmart shoppers, ingredient-conscious
**Demographic:** HHI $50K+, busy families + working professionals  
**Psychographic:** Health-conscious but taste-focused
**Media consumption:** Social + streaming heavy, cord-cutting

For tight efficiency, I need to understand the size of your addressable audience. Are you targeting parents specifically, or also childless professionals? And what's your definition of "healthier" - are we talking better-for-you positioning, organic, non-GMO, or something else?

This helps me estimate if we're looking at 20M, 50M, or 80M targetable adults, which affects channel strategy and reach expectations.

Turn 11:
Excellent - 50M addressable adults gives us solid scale for efficient targeting. The "real ingredients, higher protein, busy lifestyle" positioning is clear and differentiated.

Now for Step 4: Geography. You mentioned national launch, but with retail distribution being critical, are you launching in all markets simultaneously, or is there a phased rollout? Also, are there specific regions where your retail presence will be strongest initially - like certain Target/Walmart regions or grocery chains with regional footprints?

Understanding your retail distribution timing helps optimize media spend against actual product availability.

Turn 12:
That allocation strategy is smart - concentrating spend where retail expects stronger performance while maintaining national presence. The 60/40 split between top 30 DMAs and remaining markets gives you both efficiency and coverage.

Let me model the budget implications:

**Top 30 DMAs:** $4.8M (60%) targeting higher-performing markets
**Remaining markets:** $3.2M (40%) for national coverage

This should drive approximately 510K trials in top markets and 340K in remaining markets, aligning with retail velocity expectations.

Perfect! Now let's move to Step 5: Budget allocation. Beyond the geographic split we just discussed, how do you want to allocate spend across the campaign timeline? Are you planning an even 6-month spend, or do you want heavier investment at launch with sustained support?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 13:
Perfect front-loading strategy - that timing aligns beautifully with retail expectations and velocity monitoring.

Let me model your timeline allocation:

**Months 1-2:** $3.2M (40%) for maximum launch impact
**Months 3-4:** $2.8M (35%) to sustain momentum  
**Months 5-6:** $2.0M (25%) for ongoing support

This projects to roughly 340K trials in the critical first 8 weeks, giving you strong velocity data for retail partners.

Now for Step 6: Value Proposition. You've mentioned "real ingredients you can pronounce" and higher protein for busy lifestyles. What's your core brand message that differentiates you from existing snack options? Are you positioning as the healthier alternative to traditional snacks, or the convenient option for health-conscious consumers?
