# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience Unified Media Plan

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build this comprehensive media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've provided excellent segment detail - that will be incredibly valuable when we reach audience definition in Step 3. First, let's establish the foundation.

With 25,000 total enrollees as your volume target, what specific business outcome is this campaign designed to achieve? For example, is this about market expansion, competitive displacement, or defending existing market share?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect - aggressive market expansion with 30% membership growth is a clear objective. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success.

$3M budget ÷ 25,000 enrollees = $120 per acquisition. That's your implied cost per enrollment.

Is cost per enrollment your primary success metric, or do you measure differently? For instance, some insurers focus on lifetime value ratios or premium revenue targets since enrollment value varies significantly by plan type and member retention.

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using your ratio estimates - Young Professionals at 3.5x, Families at 5.5x, Pre-Medicare at 7.5x LTV/CAC. These are healthy ratios that suggest your $120 blended target is achievable, especially with higher investment in the more valuable segments.

Based on these ratios, you could afford roughly:
- Young Professionals: ~$85 CAC (conservative given 3.5x ratio)
- Families: ~$140 CAC (strong efficiency at 5.5x)  
- Pre-Medicare: ~$180+ CAC (excellent unit economics at 7.5x)

This creates flexibility to weight budget toward higher-LTV segments. Does this allocation approach align with your growth priorities, or would you prefer equal investment across all three segments?

Turn 5:
Perfect allocation strategy. Let me model this:

Budget allocation:
- Young Professionals: 25% = $750K at ~$85 CAC = ~8,800 enrollees
- Families: 35% = $1.05M at ~$140 CAC = ~7,500 enrollees  
- Pre-Medicare: 40% = $1.2M at ~$180 CAC = ~6,700 enrollees

Total: ~23,000 enrollees (close to your 25K target with room for optimization)

This weighting maximizes your higher-LTV segments while maintaining disciplined efficiency on young professionals. The math works well with your expansion objectives.

Now that we have solid economics, let's move to Step 3 - Audience definition. You provided excellent segment frameworks already. For the Young Professionals segment specifically, beyond ages 26-35 in urban metros, what behavioral or psychographic signals best identify your ideal prospects? For example, recent job changes, fitness app usage, or specific lifestyle indicators?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Excellent - LTV-based thinking is much smarter for insurance given the retention and premium differences across segments.

To assess if your $120 blended CAC target is achievable, I need to understand your segment economics. Can you share the approximate LTV for each segment?

For context: Young Professionals (higher churn), Families (middle tier), Pre-Medicare (highest LTV). What does the LTV look like for each, and do you have target LTV/CAC ratios you aim for?

Turn 7:
Perfect - life events and network adequacy concerns are powerful motivators for families. The suburban migration pattern is particularly valuable since it indicates active service evaluation.

For your Pre-Medicare segment, what specific signals identify prospects approaching that transition? Are you targeting people currently on employer plans nearing retirement, COBRA recipients, or those already researching Medicare transition? And do you see geographic clustering beyond FL, AZ, TX - perhaps around retirement communities or specific metro areas?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent - those are strong behavioral signals. Recent job changes and relocations create immediate need, while fitness/wellness engagement indicates health-consciousness that aligns with your brand.

For the Families segment, what behavioral or lifestyle signals help identify your best prospects? For instance, are there specific life events, financial behaviors, or family milestones that correlate with higher enrollment likelihood? And do you see patterns around existing coverage dissatisfaction or employer plan changes in this segment?

Turn 8:
Excellent audience intelligence. You have strong intent signals across all segments - job/life transitions, geographic moves, and research behaviors that indicate active shopping.

Now for Step 4 - Geography. You've outlined the key markets well. For the Young Professionals segment focusing on NYC, SF, LA, Chicago - should we expand to secondary metros like Austin, Seattle, Denver, or keep it tight to those four major urban centers? And for Families, when you mention "suburban markets around top 50 metros," are there specific DMA priorities, or should we cast wider across all major suburban rings?

Turn 9:
Perfect geographic focus. That gives us:

**Young Professionals**: 7 metros (NYC, SF, LA, Chicago, Austin, Seattle, Denver) - concentrated urban cores
**Families**: Suburban rings around top 15-20 metros - network-rich markets  
**Pre-Medicare**: FL, AZ, TX, NC, SC, NV plus retirement/medical center clusters

This geography aligns well with your provider networks and audience behaviors. The metro concentration for young professionals maximizes efficiency while the broader family coverage leverages your existing infrastructure.

Moving to Step 5 - Budget allocation by geography. Given your segment budget splits (25%/35%/40%), should we weight certain metros more heavily? For instance, do you want to go deeper in established markets like your strong pre-Medicare states, or spread evenly to maximize market expansion opportunities?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Smart expansion strategy - investing in growth markets rather than over-indexing on strength areas. 

**Geographic budget weighting:**
- **Young Professionals ($750K)**: Heavier allocation to Austin, Seattle, Denver (expansion markets) vs. NYC, SF, LA, Chicago (established)
- **Families ($1.05M)**: Even distribution across top 15-20 suburban markets 
- **Pre-Medicare ($1.2M)**: Emphasis on TX and AZ growth markets vs. FL strength market

This approach maximizes your market expansion objectives while leveraging existing network infrastructure.

Now for Step 6 - Value Proposition. Each segment needs distinct messaging. For Young Professionals, you mentioned convenience and digital-first experiences. What's your core value proposition for this segment - is it primarily about ease/speed, cost savings, or comprehensive digital health management?

Turn 11:
Perfect - "health insurance that works like the other apps you love" is strong positioning for that segment. Mobile-first convenience with speed emphasis will resonate well.

For Families, given their focus on network breadth and coverage for kids' specialists, what's your core value proposition? Is it primarily about comprehensive coverage, network quality, or peace of mind for parents managing family healthcare decisions?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 12:
Excellent - "comprehensive family coverage you can count on" with network continuity and cost predictability addresses their core anxieties perfectly.

For Pre-Medicare, given their focus on stability and Medicare transition concerns, what's your value proposition? Is it about bridging to Medicare, providing superior networks during the transition years, or positioning as the trusted choice before they age into government coverage?
