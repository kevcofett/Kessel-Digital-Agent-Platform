USER:
Hey, I'm the growth lead at QuickSend. We're a remittance fintech looking to acquire 10,000 new users this quarter with a $500K media spend. Let's build out the media strategy.

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect - you've given me a solid foundation. You want 10,000 new users with $500K spend. $500K ÷ 10,000 = $50 per user acquisition, which is achievable for fintech remittance based on typical benchmarks.

To complete our outcomes framework, how do you define success beyond user count? Are you tracking transaction volume, active senders, or revenue within a specific timeframe?

TURN 2 (Step 3)

USER:
I want transaction volume as our primary metric. We're looking for users who actually send money, not just sign up. I'd say our goal is 5,000 active senders who complete at least one transaction in the first 90 days after acquisition. Revenue would be nice, but right now we're focused on building our user base in the US market.

AGENT:
Great - active senders who transact is much stronger than just signups. That changes our efficiency math significantly.

$500K ÷ 5,000 active senders = $100 per transacting user. This is more realistic for remittance since you need quality users who actually send money, not just downloaders.

For revenue modeling, I'll assume a 2-3% take rate on transactions, which is typical for remittance. If your average first-transaction is $300, that projects to $6-9 revenue per user initially.

One key question: Do you have data on what percentage of your signups typically convert to active senders? This conversion rate will determine if we need 10K signups to get 5K senders, or a different ratio.
