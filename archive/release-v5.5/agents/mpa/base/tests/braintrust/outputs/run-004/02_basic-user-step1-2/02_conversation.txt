USER:
Hi! I'm looking to get more people to buy shoes from our online store. Can you help me figure out the best way to do that?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve? For example, are you looking to get more first-time customers, increase sales from existing customers, or something else?

TURN 2 (Step 1)

USER:
We definitely want more first-time customers. Right now, our online store doesn't get as many new buyers as we'd like, and I'm hoping we can find a way to get more people to discover StepRight Shoes and make their first purchase.

AGENT:
Perfect! Getting more first-time customers is a clear objective. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success.

What number would tell you this campaign worked? For example, would success be getting 1,000 new customers, or reaching $50,000 in sales from new buyers, or something else?

USER:
I'm not totally sure about the exact number, but I think getting around 500 new customers would be amazing. We've been struggling to break into the online market, so if we could get 500 people to try our shoes who've never bought from us before, that would be a big win for us.

AGENT:
Excellent! 500 new first-time customers is a solid target. Now I need one more piece to start modeling your plan.

What budget are you working with to bring in these 500 new customers?

TURN 4 (Step 3)

USER:
We have about $250,000 to spend on this campaign. I'm hoping we can use that to really get our brand out there and attract those 500 new customers.

AGENT:
Great! Let me run the numbers on your plan:

$250,000 ÷ 500 customers = $500 per customer

This means you can spend up to $500 to acquire each new customer. That's quite generous for most shoe businesses and gives us excellent flexibility to reach quality customers through multiple channels.

To make sure this works financially, how much does a typical first-time customer spend on their initial purchase?
