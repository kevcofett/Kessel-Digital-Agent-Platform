# Media Plan Output: Precision Targeting with Complex Attributes

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I am excited to build a media plan with you. We will cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Your brief shows sophisticated targeting - HNW acquisition with $1.5M budget for 2,500 qualified leads. That implies $600 per qualified lead, which is reasonable for wealth management given typical conversion rates and client values.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 2,500 qualified leads?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your objective is $250-300M in new AUM through lead conversion, with 250-375 new clients (10-15% of 2,500 leads) averaging $100-125K each.

Let me verify the economics: $1.5M budget / 2,500 leads = $600 per qualified lead. If 12.5% convert (midpoint), that's 312 new clients at $4,807 per client acquisition cost.

With $112K average AUM (midpoint) and typical wealth management fees of 1-1.5%, each client generates $1,120-1,680 annually. Your payback period would be roughly 3-4 years, which aligns with industry standards for HNW acquisition.

Is this efficiency target realistic based on your historical lead-to-client conversion rates and fee structure?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it. Let me adjust the model: At 8.5% conversion (midpoint), that's 212 new clients from 2,500 leads.

$1.5M / 212 clients = $7,075 per client acquisition cost

At $112K average AUM and 0.875% fees (midpoint), each client generates $980 annually. That's a 7.2-year payback period, which is aggressive but manageable for HNW given their lifetime value and referral potential.

Your targeting precision becomes critical - you need highly qualified leads to hit that 8.5% conversion rate. Based on wealth management benchmarks, this efficiency is achievable but requires tight audience definition and premium channels.

The economics work if execution is sharp. Ready to move to audience definition where precision matters most?

Turn 5:
Perfect - that gives us sharp targeting signals. Your audience definition is shaping up as:

**Core Demographics:** Ages 45-65, $1M+ investable assets
**Firmographics:** Tech/healthcare/professional services, enterprise software, health tech, management consulting
**Job Titles:** Founder, CEO, Managing Partner
**Behavioral Signals:** Researching tax optimization, estate planning, business succession
**Geographic Concentration:** Bay Area, NYC metro, Seattle (your top performers)

Your 50K client base creates powerful lookalike potential, especially with those specific industry and title patterns.

One critical question for reach estimation: Within your target DMAs, are you open to expanding beyond your core industries if the behavioral signals (tax/estate research) are strong? Or do you want to maintain strict industry focus even if it limits addressable audience size?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Excellent - your first-party data is a major advantage for HNW targeting. Let's build precision into your audience definition.

Starting with your core demographic foundation: HNW individuals, $1M+ investable assets, ages 45-65, executives and business owners approaching retirement or liquidity events.

You mentioned three key behavioral signals: tax optimization research, estate planning research, and business succession planning research. 

From your 50K client CRM data, what are the top 3-5 demographic or firmographic patterns that distinguish your highest-value clients? For example, specific industries, company sizes, job titles, or geographic concentrations that could strengthen your lookalike modeling?

Turn 6:
Perfect. That behavioral-first approach is smart for HNW targeting.

Your audience hierarchy prioritizes:
1. **Primary behavioral signals** (tax optimization, estate planning, business succession research) - non-negotiable
2. **Core industries** (tech, healthcare, professional services) - preferred but flexible
3. **Adjacent industries** (finance, real estate development, manufacturing) - acceptable with strong behavioral signals
4. **Executive titles** (Founder, CEO, Managing Partner) - reinforcing signal

This gives you expansion room while maintaining precision.

Now for geography - you mentioned focusing on top DMAs by HNW concentration. You've identified Bay Area performance strength and mentioned NYC, SF, LA, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Denver, Miami, Dallas, DC in your brief.

Should we prioritize your proven performers (Bay Area, NYC metro, Seattle) with higher spend allocation, or distribute more evenly across all ten DMAs?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Excellent allocation strategy. Your 60/40 split maximizes efficiency while preserving growth potential.

**Tier 1 (60% = $900K):** Bay Area, NYC metro, Seattle - your proven performers
**Tier 2 (40% = $600K):** LA, Chicago, Boston, Denver, Miami, Dallas, DC - distributed across seven markets (~$85K each)

This concentrates firepower where conversion rates are highest while testing expansion markets at meaningful scale.

Quick validation on your budget: $1.5M total budget targeting 2,500 qualified leads across these ten DMAs. Given HNW targeting complexity and premium channel requirements, is this your total media budget, or do you have additional budget for creative development, landing page optimization, and lead nurturing that sits outside this $1.5M?

Turn 8:
Perfect - that $1.85-1.9M total investment shows proper planning. The $350-400K supporting infrastructure is essential for HNW conversion optimization.

Your $1.5M media budget breaks down to:
- **Tier 1 markets:** $300K each (Bay Area, NYC, Seattle)  
- **Tier 2 markets:** ~$85K each across seven DMAs

At $600 per qualified lead target, this projects:
- **Tier 1:** 500 leads each (1,500 total)
- **Tier 2:** ~140 leads each (1,000 total)

Given your 8.5% conversion rate, that's roughly 212 new clients generating $250-300M AUM.

Now for your value proposition - what's your primary differentiator when competing for HNW clients? Is it specialized expertise in liquidity events, tax optimization strategies, or something else that sets LuxeFinance apart in this crowded market?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Excellent positioning - "We predict and plan" versus reactive management is compelling for HNW prospects.

Your value proposition centers on:
- **Proactive wealth architecture** vs. traditional asset management
- **Strategic tax engineering** with multi-generational planning
- **Team expertise** from investment banking, tax law, private equity
- **Liquidity event specialization** for your core audience

This messaging should resonate strongly with your behavioral targeting around tax optimization and estate planning research.

For channels, given your precision targeting and premium positioning, I'm seeing strong fit for LinkedIn targeting (executive titles, company data), financial publication direct placements, and potentially programmatic with your first-party lookalikes.

What's your current channel mix, and are there any channels you've tested that either performed exceptionally well or failed to deliver qualified leads?

Turn 10:
Perfect channel intelligence. Your performance data shapes the media mix clearly.

**High performers:** LinkedIn (strongest), financial pubs (solid but pricey), podcast sponsorships (surprising quality)
**Mixed results:** Connected TV/OTT (higher CPLs but some success)
**Underperformers:** Programmatic display (too much waste)

Given your $1.5M budget and $600 CPL target, I recommend this allocation:

**LinkedIn (50% = $750K)** - Your proven winner, maximize first-party lookalikes
**Financial Publications (25% = $375K)** - Premium but qualified, focus on Barron's/WSJ
**Podcast Sponsorships (15% = $225K)** - Scale the surprising performer
**Connected TV/OTT (10% = $150K)** - Test optimization in Tier 1 markets only

This concentrates 75% in your proven channels while testing CTV refinement.

For measurement, what attribution model are you currently using to track LinkedIn and publication performance back to actual AUM conversion?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 11:
Excellent attribution setup - tracking 6-9 month conversion cycles is critical for HNW. Your CRM integration gives you clean lead-to-AUM visibility.

The offline challenge you mentioned is typical for wealth management. Digital generates initial interest, but relationship conversion often happens through personal meetings and referrals.

For measurement hierarchy, I recommend:
**Primary KPI:** Qualified leads at $600 CPL (immediate tracking)
**Secondary KPI:** Lead-to-client conversion at 8.5% target (6-9 month lag)
**Success KPI:** AUM conversion to $250-300M target (12+ month validation)

Given your long conversion cycles, how do you currently validate lead quality early in the funnel? Do you have scoring criteria or qualification thresholds that predict which leads will convert to meaningful AUM relationships?

Turn 12:
Excellent - your lead scoring creates quality gates that predict conversion success. The 2x conversion rate for multi-content engagers is powerful intelligence.

Your measurement framework is solid:
- **Lead scoring model** with 75+ point threshold for sales handoff
- **Content engagement depth** as conversion predictor
- **Technical content consumption** driving 2x conversion rates
- **Multi-touch attribution** across 6-9 month cycles

For testing, given your $1.5M budget and proven channel performance, what's your biggest unknown that you want to validate? Is it audience expansion into adjacent industries, geographic performance in Tier 2 markets, or optimizing creative messaging for different wealth segments?
