# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience with Different KPIs Per Segment

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build this multi-segment media plan with you. This is sophisticated work - three distinct objectives with different success metrics and customer lifecycles. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks.

Your segmentation is sharp: conquest for awareness, in-market for leads, loyalty for retention. Each needs different strategic treatment.

Let me start with your conquest segment since awareness campaigns have the longest attribution windows. For the 35% conquest budget ($1.575M), what specific awareness outcome defines success? Are you measuring brand lift through surveys, consideration shift in market research, or aided/unaided recall improvements?

The key is defining a measurable awareness KPI that connects to future purchase intent, since you're right that conversion could be 2-3 years out.

Turn 2:
Perfect - 10-15% brand consideration lift among competitor owners over 12 months is your conquest objective. That's measurable and realistic for automotive awareness campaigns.

Now let's establish if your $1.575M conquest budget can achieve that lift efficiently. 

$1.575M ÷ 12 months = $131K monthly for awareness reach. In automotive, driving meaningful brand lift typically requires sustained frequency against your target demo.

What's your total addressable market size for conquest? Specifically, how many competitor vehicle owners are in your geographic footprint? This could be households currently driving Toyota/Honda if you're selling domestic, or vice versa.

This number determines your reach requirements and whether $131K monthly can generate the frequency needed for brand lift.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent data. Let me calculate your conquest efficiency:

225,000 households × 35% viable targets = 78,750 conquest households
$1.575M ÷ 78,750 = $20 per household annually

That's strong efficiency for automotive awareness. Industry benchmarks typically show $15-30 per household for sustained brand building campaigns, so you're in viable range.

For meaningful brand lift, you'll need approximately 8-12 exposures per household over 12 months. At $20 per household, that projects to $1.50-2.50 per exposure, which aligns well with mixed media CPMs in automotive.

Your conquest economics look achievable. The 10-15% consideration lift is realistic with that reach and frequency investment.

Now let's tackle your in-market segment - the performance piece. For your 45% budget ($2.025M), you mentioned leads as the primary KPI. What's your target lead volume, and do you have a sense of current cost-per-lead or lead-to-sale conversion rates from existing efforts?

Turn 5:
Perfect recalibration. Let's model the improved efficiency:

$2.025M ÷ 6,000 leads = $338 CPL

Still above your target $100-150 range. To hit $125 CPL with 6,000 leads, you'd need approximately $750K budget, not $2.025M.

This suggests either:
1. Reallocate more budget from conquest/loyalty to in-market performance
2. Accept higher CPL initially while optimizing toward $125 target
3. Reduce other segment budgets to fund more aggressive lead generation

At 6,000 leads: 6,000 × 23.5% × 35% = 494 sales annually
$2.025M ÷ 494 = $4,100 per sale - much more sustainable against your $2,500-3,000 margins.

Your economics look achievable with the higher lead volume. 

Now for loyalty: 20% budget ($900K) for existing customer retention. What's your target outcome here - service appointments booked, trade-in inquiries, or lease renewals? And roughly how many existing customers are in your retention pool?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Got it - let's model your in-market efficiency:

$2.025M ÷ 3,000 leads = $675 per lead

That's significantly higher than your historical $75-250 range. Either your lead volume target is conservative or we need to reassess the budget allocation.

Let me check the math on outcomes: 3,000 leads × 23.5% to test drive = 705 test drives × 35% to sale = 247 sales annually across 12 stores. That's about 20 sales per store from paid media.

At $675 CPL, you're essentially paying $8,200 per sale ($2.025M ÷ 247 sales). 

Is that efficiency realistic given your average vehicle margins? Or should we target higher lead volume - perhaps 6,000-8,000 leads annually - to get closer to your historical $75-250 CPL range?

What's a realistic cost-per-sale you can absorb while maintaining profitability?

Turn 7:
Excellent targeting framework. Let me size this refined conquest audience:

Starting with your 78,750 viable competitor households, applying these filters:
- Income $85K-$150K (roughly 45% of metro households)
- Age 35-55 (about 35% of adult population)  
- Professional/career-focused (approximately 60% overlap with income)
- 3-5 year ownership cycle timing (roughly 40% at any given time)

Conservative estimate: 78,750 × 0.45 × 0.35 × 0.60 × 0.40 = approximately 2,400 highly qualified conquest households

This is much tighter than your original 78,750, which changes your efficiency dramatically:

$1.575M ÷ 2,400 households = $656 per household annually

That's significantly higher than typical awareness benchmarks. For meaningful brand lift among this precise audience, you'll need premium placements and higher frequency.

Should we expand the age range to 30-60, or consider 2-6 year ownership cycles to increase your addressable audience? Or does this precision targeting justify the higher per-household investment given the upgrade motivation and income level?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Let me calculate your loyalty efficiency:

$900K across 4,500 total actions (2,500 + 1,200 + 800) = $200 per retention action

Breaking it down:
- Service appointments: $900K × 56% = $504K ÷ 2,500 = $202 per appointment
- Trade-in inquiries: $900K × 27% = $243K ÷ 1,200 = $203 per inquiry  
- Renewals: $900K × 17% = $153K ÷ 800 = $191 per renewal engagement

You're targeting 10.7% of your 42,000 customer base (4,500 ÷ 42,000). Since 35% are in active cycles (14,700 households), you're aiming to activate 31% of your highest-probability segments.

At $200 per action, this is efficient for automotive retention marketing. Service appointments alone generate significant lifetime value, and your 3x repurchase multiplier makes this investment defensible.

Your three-segment economics are now realistic: conquest at $20 per household for brand lift, in-market at $4,100 per sale, loyalty at $200 per retention action.

Ready to define your audiences more precisely? Let's start with conquest - those 78,750 competitor households. Beyond Toyota/Honda/Mazda owners, what demographic and behavioral signals help identify your best conquest prospects?

Turn 8:
Perfect strategic alignment. Premium positioning demands premium precision, and $656 per household for high-impact, contextually relevant placements makes sense for your upgrade-motivated professionals.

Now let's define your in-market audience - the active shoppers driving your 6,000 lead target. You mentioned they're browsing Autotrader, Cars.com, and checking reviews.

Beyond those behavioral signals, what demographic and geographic parameters define your best in-market prospects? Are you targeting the same $85K-$150K income range, or does active shopping behavior open up different segments? And how does your 50-mile radius break down - are there specific DMAs, zip codes, or drive-time zones that perform better for your 12 dealership locations?

Turn 10:
Perfect - your $4.5M allocation is strategically sound with conquest at $1.575M, in-market at $2.025M, and loyalty at $900K.

Before we dive into channels, let's establish your value proposition framework for each segment. Different audiences need different messaging approaches.

For your conquest segment - those 2,400 upgrade-motivated professionals - what's your core value proposition? You mentioned premium positioning and professional status signaling. 

Is your primary message focused on:
- Advanced technology and connectivity features
- Premium brand perception and status
- Superior safety and reliability compared to their current Toyota/Honda
- Professional image enhancement
- Or a combination with one primary driver

This messaging foundation determines which channels and creative approaches will resonate most with your precision-targeted professionals.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Excellent geographic precision. Let me model your in-market audience sizing:

Three primary DMAs focused on 15 high-performing zip codes within 25-mile drive times. Income $65K-$175K captures broader middle-to-upper-middle class (roughly 55% of households in your metro areas).

Conservative estimate for active shoppers (in-market for vehicle purchase within 6-12 months): approximately 3-5% of households at any given time.

Your target geography likely contains 180,000-220,000 total households. Applying income filter (55%) and active shopping behavior (4%) = approximately 4,000-4,800 active in-market households annually.

$2.025M ÷ 4,400 households = $460 per in-market household

At 6,000 lead target, you're aiming for 1.4 leads per household ($338 CPL as calculated earlier). This suggests strong conversion rates from your geographic targeting.

Your loyalty audience is clearest - 42,000 existing customers with CRM data.

Ready for budget allocation? You have $4.5M total with conquest at 35% ($1.575M), in-market at 45% ($2.025M), loyalty at 20% ($900K). Should we refine these percentages based on our audience sizing, or does this allocation still feel right given your strategic priorities?

Turn 12:
Excellent evolution - "Professional Momentum, Available Now" bridges aspiration with action perfectly. You're maintaining brand consistency while adding purchase urgency.

Finally, your loyalty segment - 42,000 existing customers targeting service, trade-ins, and renewals. 

For these customers who already chose you once, what's your retention value proposition? Is it:
- Relationship continuity: "We know your history, preferences, and needs"
- Exclusive member benefits and priority treatment
- Investment protection: "Maximize your vehicle's value through our service/trade programs"
- Trusted advisor: "Your automotive partner for life's next chapter"

Since these customers have 3x higher repurchase likelihood with service retention, your loyalty messaging likely emphasizes relationship value over competitive differentiation. What motivates an existing customer to stay engaged rather than shop around?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Brilliant positioning - "Your vehicle is an extension of your professional brand" speaks directly to career-minded upgrade motivations. This peer-to-peer career elevation angle differentiates you from traditional automotive messaging.

Now for your in-market segment - those 4,400 active shoppers with broader income range ($65K-$175K). They're already researching on Autotrader and Cars.com, so they're in evaluation mode.

Does your in-market value proposition shift to more functional benefits - reliability, value, dealer experience, financing options? Or do you maintain the professional brand extension message but emphasize immediate purchase drivers like inventory availability, competitive pricing, or superior dealer service?

The key is whether active shoppers need different motivation than long-term consideration builders. What drives someone from research phase to your dealership for a test drive?
