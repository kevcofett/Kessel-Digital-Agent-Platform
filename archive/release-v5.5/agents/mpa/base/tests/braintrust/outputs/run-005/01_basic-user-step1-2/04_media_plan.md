# Media Plan Output: Basic User - Steps 1-2 Completion

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve? For example, are you looking to get a certain number of new customers, hit a revenue target, or grow sales by a specific amount?

Turn 2:
Great goals! Growing revenue by 30% is ambitious and achievable with the right approach. To make sure we build a realistic plan, I need to understand what that 30% growth means in actual numbers.

What's your current annual revenue, so I can calculate what 30% growth would be in dollars?

Turn 3:
Perfect! $600,000 in additional revenue is your target. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success as we go.

For tracking progress toward that $600K, what matters most to you - the total number of new customers you bring in, or something else like average order value? This helps me figure out if we should focus on getting more people to buy or getting existing customers to spend more.
