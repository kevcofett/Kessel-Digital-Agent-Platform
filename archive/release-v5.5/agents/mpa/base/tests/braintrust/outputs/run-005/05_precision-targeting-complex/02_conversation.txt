TURN 1 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I'm the Director of Performance Marketing at LuxeFinance, a wealth management firm. We need to build a precision media plan to acquire high-net-worth individuals - specifically people with $1M+ in investable assets, typically 45-65, executives and business owners who are either approaching retirement or have a major liquidity event coming up. We're interested in people researching tax optimization and estate planning. Budget is $1.5M, targeting 2,500 qualified leads. We have CRM data on 50K existing clients we can use for modeling. Focus on top DMAs by HNW concentration - NYC, SF, LA, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Denver, Miami, Dallas, DC. Quality matters more than volume here.

AGENT:
Hi! I am excited to build a media plan with you. We will cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Your brief shows sophisticated targeting - HNW acquisition with clear demographic and behavioral signals. $1.5M / 2,500 = $600 per qualified lead, which is aggressive but achievable for wealth management given typical client values.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 2,500 qualified leads?

TURN 2 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're looking to drive new AUM growth - these qualified leads need to convert to actual clients who bring significant assets under management. Our typical new HNW client brings $2-5M in AUM, so if we can convert even 10-15% of these leads, we're talking about $500M+ in new assets. The real outcome is expanding our client base in key markets while maintaining our premium positioning and avoiding any brand dilution from lower-quality prospects.

AGENT:
Perfect. So your primary objective is new AUM growth through premium client acquisition. At 10-15% conversion from qualified leads, you're projecting 250-375 new clients bringing $500M+ in AUM.

For your primary KPI - how do you measure success as a number? Are you tracking qualified leads that meet your $1M+ criteria, or do you measure further down the funnel like consultation bookings or actual AUM onboarded?

TURN 3 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We track through the full funnel but our primary KPI is qualified leads that meet our criteria - someone with $1M+ investable assets who's actively researching wealth management services. From there, our sales team handles the conversion process, but we need to make sure the leads we're passing over are genuinely qualified. We also track consultation bookings as a secondary metric since that shows real intent, but the media spend gets evaluated primarily on qualified lead volume and cost per lead.

AGENT:
Excellent. Primary KPI is qualified leads meeting $1M+ investable assets criteria, with consultation bookings as secondary validation of intent quality.

Your $600 per qualified lead target is ambitious for HNW - typical wealth management sees $800-1,200 per qualified lead based on industry benchmarks. However, your 50K client CRM for lookalike modeling and focus on top HNW DMAs gives you significant targeting advantages.

Given your typical client brings $2-5M AUM, what's the lifetime value of a new HNW client relationship to help validate if $600 per lead efficiency supports your unit economics?

TURN 4 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Honestly, we haven't fully mapped out our LTV calculations - that's been more on the business development side. But ballpark, if a typical client brings $3M in AUM and we're charging around 1% management fees, that's $30K annually. Over a 10+ year relationship, we're looking at significant value even accounting for servicing costs. The $600 per lead makes sense when you factor in our 10-15% conversion rate - so we're really paying around $4,000-6,000 per actual client acquisition, which feels reasonable given the revenue potential.

AGENT:
Got it. I'll model using $300K LTV over 10 years based on your $30K annual fees, which is conservative given wealth management client tenure often exceeds 10 years. 

Your math checks out: $600 per lead / 12.5% conversion = $4,800 per client acquisition. With $300K LTV, that projects to a 62x LTV/CAC ratio, which is extremely healthy for wealth management.

However, your $600 per lead target is 25-50% more efficient than typical HNW benchmarks. To hit this efficiency, we'll need precise audience definition and channel optimization. Your CRM lookalike advantage should help significantly.

Step 1 complete - we have clear AUM growth objective with 2,500 qualified leads as primary KPI. Ready to dive deeper into your audience definition?

TURN 5 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Yes, let's dive into the audience definition. We know our sweet spot is HNW individuals with $1M+ investable assets, but we can get more granular. Our first-party data shows the highest-converting prospects are typically C-suite executives at mid-to-large companies, successful entrepreneurs who've had exits, and established professionals like doctors or lawyers in their peak earning years. They're usually researching wealth management because they've hit a trigger event - approaching retirement, selling a business, or realizing they need more sophisticated tax strategies. We want to avoid the mass affluent crowd who might have high incomes but limited investable assets.

AGENT:
Excellent precision. Your first-party data reveals three high-value segments: C-suite executives, successful entrepreneurs post-exit, and peak-earning professionals. The trigger event insight is crucial - these aren't passive prospects but active researchers facing wealth transition moments.

Your 50K client CRM gives you a major targeting advantage. Lookalike audiences from your highest-value existing clients typically outperform prospecting by 40-60% for HNW acquisition.

Beyond demographics and life stage, what behavioral signals indicate someone is actively researching wealth management services? For example, are they reading specific content, visiting competitor sites, or showing other digital behaviors that suggest they're in-market?

Events: benchmark_cited, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 6 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our CRM data shows the most qualified prospects are consuming content around tax optimization, estate planning, and retirement transition strategies. They're typically reading financial publications like Barron's, WSJ, and Financial Planning magazine, plus visiting sites like Morningstar and our competitors like Morgan Stanley Private Wealth and UBS. We also see strong signals from people researching specific topics like charitable giving strategies, trust structures, and portfolio diversification beyond traditional assets. LinkedIn engagement with wealth management content is another strong indicator - especially when they're actively commenting or sharing posts about market volatility or tax law changes.

AGENT:
Perfect behavioral mapping. Your prospects show sophisticated financial content consumption - Barron's, WSJ, Morningstar - plus competitor research and advanced topics like trust structures and alternative assets. LinkedIn engagement with wealth management content is a particularly strong intent signal.

This creates a powerful multi-layered targeting approach: CRM lookalikes as your primary audience, layered with behavioral signals around tax optimization and estate planning research, plus engagement with premium financial content.

Given your focus on quality over volume, what's the estimated size of your total addressable audience across those top 10 DMAs? Are we looking at hundreds of thousands or millions of potential prospects who fit these criteria?

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 7 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I'd estimate we're looking at maybe 200-300K potential prospects across those top 10 DMAs when you layer in all our criteria - the $1M+ investable assets requirement really narrows the pool significantly. NYC and SF probably account for about 40% of that audience given the concentration of wealth there. When we add the behavioral overlays like financial content consumption and competitor research, we're probably down to 150K highly qualified prospects. That's actually perfect for our precision approach - we'd rather have a smaller, highly targeted audience than cast too wide a net and dilute our messaging.

AGENT:
Excellent sizing. 150K highly qualified prospects after behavioral overlays gives you strong precision without limiting reach. NYC and SF representing 40% aligns perfectly with HNW concentration patterns.

Your 2,500 lead target represents 1.7% of that qualified audience, which is aggressive but achievable with your sophisticated targeting stack: CRM lookalikes + behavioral signals + premium content consumption + competitor research activity.

Now let's map this to geography. You mentioned 10 key DMAs. Beyond NYC and SF representing 40%, how would you prioritize the remaining eight markets? Are there specific DMAs where your current client concentration suggests stronger conversion potential?

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 8 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Looking at our existing client base, LA and Chicago are our next strongest markets - probably another 25% of our target audience combined. Boston and Seattle have been growing for us, especially Seattle with all the tech wealth creation. Denver's been surprisingly strong, lots of energy executives and entrepreneurs there. Miami's interesting because of the tax advantages drawing HNW individuals from other states. Dallas has great potential with the corporate headquarters concentration, and DC obviously has the government contractor and lobbying wealth. I'd probably allocate based on existing client density first, then layer in market opportunity - so NYC, SF, LA, Chicago get the heaviest investment, then tier two would be Boston, Seattle, Denver.

AGENT:
Smart prioritization based on client performance data. Your geographic weighting makes strong strategic sense:

**Tier 1 (65% of audience):** NYC, SF, LA, Chicago - proven conversion markets
**Tier 2 (25% of audience):** Boston, Seattle, Denver - growth markets with strong signals  
**Tier 3 (10% of audience):** Miami, Dallas, DC - opportunity markets

This geographic concentration aligns well with your $600 per lead efficiency target. Focusing spend where you have existing client proof points should improve conversion rates significantly.

Your audience definition is complete: 150K qualified HNW prospects across tiered DMAs, with sophisticated behavioral and firmographic targeting. Ready to validate your budget allocation strategy?

TURN 9 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Yes, that tiering looks right - focusing our spend where we have proven conversion data should definitely help us hit that $600 per lead target. I like the 65/25/10 split, gives us room to scale in our strongest markets while still testing growth opportunities in the tier two and three markets. Let's move into budget allocation - I'm curious how you'd recommend distributing that $1.5M across channels and markets to maximize our qualified lead generation.

AGENT:
Perfect timing to dive into budget allocation. Your $1.5M budget with geographic tiering creates a strong foundation.

Based on your 65/25/10 geographic split:
- **Tier 1 markets:** $975K (NYC, SF, LA, Chicago)
- **Tier 2 markets:** $375K (Boston, Seattle, Denver) 
- **Tier 3 markets:** $150K (Miami, Dallas, DC)

Before we get to channel allocation in Step 7, I need to understand your budget flexibility. Given HNW campaigns require optimization time and your aggressive $600 per lead target, how much of that $1.5M needs to be held in reserve for performance adjustments and scaling successful tactics?

Industry practice for precision campaigns like this is typically 10-15% flexibility reserve.

Events: calculation_performed, benchmark_cited, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 10 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
That geographic split looks solid - having nearly $1M focused on our proven Tier 1 markets should give us the scale we need while still allowing meaningful tests in the growth markets. 

For budget flexibility, I'd be comfortable holding back around $200K as a performance reserve - that's about 13% which falls right in your recommended range. Given how precise our targeting needs to be and the fact that HNW prospects have longer consideration cycles, we'll definitely need room to optimize creative, adjust channel mix, and double down on what's working. Plus if we find a particular market or channel is significantly outperforming, having that reserve lets us capitalize quickly.

AGENT:
Excellent. $200K performance reserve (13%) gives you solid optimization capacity while keeping $1.3M in active deployment. That's disciplined budget management for precision HNW campaigns.

Your working budget becomes:
- **Tier 1:** $845K (65%)
- **Tier 2:** $325K (25%) 
- **Tier 3:** $130K (10%)
- **Performance Reserve:** $200K

This structure supports your longer HNW consideration cycles and allows rapid scaling of outperforming tactics.

Now for your value proposition - what's your core differentiator that resonates most with HNW prospects during their wealth transition moments? Is it specialized expertise, personalized service, tax optimization capabilities, or something else that sets LuxeFinance apart from Morgan Stanley and UBS?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 11 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our biggest differentiator is our boutique approach combined with institutional-grade capabilities. Unlike the big wirehouses where HNW clients can feel like small fish, we offer direct partner access and truly customized strategies. Our sweet spot is sophisticated tax optimization and estate planning - we have CPAs and estate attorneys in-house, so we're not just managing assets, we're architecting comprehensive wealth strategies. 

The messaging that resonates most with our prospects is around "wealth transition expertise" - whether they're exiting a business, approaching retirement, or dealing with sudden liquidity events. We position ourselves as the specialists who understand the complexity of their situation, not just another investment manager. Our conversion data shows prospects respond strongly to case studies about tax savings and estate structuring for clients in similar situations.

AGENT:
Perfect positioning. "Wealth transition expertise" with boutique service and institutional capabilities directly addresses your trigger event prospects. Having CPAs and estate attorneys in-house is a compelling differentiator versus wirehouses.

Your case study approach is smart - HNW prospects want proof points from similar situations, not generic investment performance. Tax savings and estate structuring outcomes provide concrete value demonstration.

This creates strong messaging hierarchy:
- **Primary:** Wealth transition expertise for life-changing financial moments
- **Proof:** Case studies showing tax optimization and estate planning outcomes  
- **Differentiator:** Boutique attention with institutional resources

Your value proposition is clear and conversion-tested. Ready to build your channel strategy? We'll match your sophisticated messaging to channels where HNW prospects are actively researching wealth management solutions.

TURN 12 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Absolutely, let's dive into channel strategy. Based on our targeting and messaging, I'm thinking we need a mix that reaches HNW prospects in their research phase across multiple touchpoints. 

LinkedIn should be a major component - that's where we see the strongest engagement signals from our target audience, especially for the wealth transition messaging. Programmatic display can help us reach them when they're consuming financial content on Barron's, WSJ, and competitor sites. I'm also interested in Connected TV for brand building in those top DMAs, and we've had good results with podcast sponsorships on financial shows. Financial publisher direct buys might be worth exploring too for premium placement.

What's your take on channel prioritization given our $600 per lead target and the need for sophisticated creative that showcases our case studies?

AGENT:
Excellent channel instincts. Your selections align perfectly with HNW research behavior and support sophisticated creative showcasing case studies.

**Channel Analysis:**

**LinkedIn (40-45% allocation):** Premium targeting, wealth transition content performs well, supports case study formats. Expect $400-600 CPL for HNW.

**Programmatic Display (25-30%):** Contextual targeting on financial sites, retargeting prospects. Lower CPL but longer attribution window.

**Connected TV (15-20%):** Brand building in top DMAs, premium positioning reinforcement. Harder to attribute but supports other channels.

**Podcast Sponsorships (10-15%):** High-intent audience, trusted environment. Financial shows like "Chat with Traders" or "Motley Fool Money."

**Financial Publisher Direct (5-10%):** Premium placement on WSJ/Barron's, immediate credibility.

Given your $600 CPL target is 25% below benchmarks, I'd weight toward LinkedIn and programmatic first - they offer the best targeting precision for your efficiency goals.

Which channel would you prioritize for initial testing and optimization?
