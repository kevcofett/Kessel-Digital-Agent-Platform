# Media Plan Output: Precision Targeting with Complex Attributes

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I am excited to build a media plan with you. We will cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Your brief shows sophisticated targeting - HNW acquisition with clear demographic and behavioral signals. $1.5M / 2,500 = $600 per qualified lead, which is aggressive but achievable for wealth management given typical client values.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 2,500 qualified leads?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your primary objective is new AUM growth through premium client acquisition. At 10-15% conversion from qualified leads, you're projecting 250-375 new clients bringing $500M+ in AUM.

For your primary KPI - how do you measure success as a number? Are you tracking qualified leads that meet your $1M+ criteria, or do you measure further down the funnel like consultation bookings or actual AUM onboarded?

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using $300K LTV over 10 years based on your $30K annual fees, which is conservative given wealth management client tenure often exceeds 10 years. 

Your math checks out: $600 per lead / 12.5% conversion = $4,800 per client acquisition. With $300K LTV, that projects to a 62x LTV/CAC ratio, which is extremely healthy for wealth management.

However, your $600 per lead target is 25-50% more efficient than typical HNW benchmarks. To hit this efficiency, we'll need precise audience definition and channel optimization. Your CRM lookalike advantage should help significantly.

Step 1 complete - we have clear AUM growth objective with 2,500 qualified leads as primary KPI. Ready to dive deeper into your audience definition?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent. Primary KPI is qualified leads meeting $1M+ investable assets criteria, with consultation bookings as secondary validation of intent quality.

Your $600 per qualified lead target is ambitious for HNW - typical wealth management sees $800-1,200 per qualified lead based on industry benchmarks. However, your 50K client CRM for lookalike modeling and focus on top HNW DMAs gives you significant targeting advantages.

Given your typical client brings $2-5M AUM, what's the lifetime value of a new HNW client relationship to help validate if $600 per lead efficiency supports your unit economics?

Turn 5:
Excellent precision. Your first-party data reveals three high-value segments: C-suite executives, successful entrepreneurs post-exit, and peak-earning professionals. The trigger event insight is crucial - these aren't passive prospects but active researchers facing wealth transition moments.

Your 50K client CRM gives you a major targeting advantage. Lookalike audiences from your highest-value existing clients typically outperform prospecting by 40-60% for HNW acquisition.

Beyond demographics and life stage, what behavioral signals indicate someone is actively researching wealth management services? For example, are they reading specific content, visiting competitor sites, or showing other digital behaviors that suggest they're in-market?

Turn 6:
Perfect behavioral mapping. Your prospects show sophisticated financial content consumption - Barron's, WSJ, Morningstar - plus competitor research and advanced topics like trust structures and alternative assets. LinkedIn engagement with wealth management content is a particularly strong intent signal.

This creates a powerful multi-layered targeting approach: CRM lookalikes as your primary audience, layered with behavioral signals around tax optimization and estate planning research, plus engagement with premium financial content.

Given your focus on quality over volume, what's the estimated size of your total addressable audience across those top 10 DMAs? Are we looking at hundreds of thousands or millions of potential prospects who fit these criteria?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 7:
Excellent sizing. 150K highly qualified prospects after behavioral overlays gives you strong precision without limiting reach. NYC and SF representing 40% aligns perfectly with HNW concentration patterns.

Your 2,500 lead target represents 1.7% of that qualified audience, which is aggressive but achievable with your sophisticated targeting stack: CRM lookalikes + behavioral signals + premium content consumption + competitor research activity.

Now let's map this to geography. You mentioned 10 key DMAs. Beyond NYC and SF representing 40%, how would you prioritize the remaining eight markets? Are there specific DMAs where your current client concentration suggests stronger conversion potential?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Smart prioritization based on client performance data. Your geographic weighting makes strong strategic sense:

**Tier 1 (65% of audience):** NYC, SF, LA, Chicago - proven conversion markets
**Tier 2 (25% of audience):** Boston, Seattle, Denver - growth markets with strong signals  
**Tier 3 (10% of audience):** Miami, Dallas, DC - opportunity markets

This geographic concentration aligns well with your $600 per lead efficiency target. Focusing spend where you have existing client proof points should improve conversion rates significantly.

Your audience definition is complete: 150K qualified HNW prospects across tiered DMAs, with sophisticated behavioral and firmographic targeting. Ready to validate your budget allocation strategy?

Turn 9:
Perfect timing to dive into budget allocation. Your $1.5M budget with geographic tiering creates a strong foundation.

Based on your 65/25/10 geographic split:
- **Tier 1 markets:** $975K (NYC, SF, LA, Chicago)
- **Tier 2 markets:** $375K (Boston, Seattle, Denver) 
- **Tier 3 markets:** $150K (Miami, Dallas, DC)

Before we get to channel allocation in Step 7, I need to understand your budget flexibility. Given HNW campaigns require optimization time and your aggressive $600 per lead target, how much of that $1.5M needs to be held in reserve for performance adjustments and scaling successful tactics?

Industry practice for precision campaigns like this is typically 10-15% flexibility reserve.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 11:
Perfect positioning. "Wealth transition expertise" with boutique service and institutional capabilities directly addresses your trigger event prospects. Having CPAs and estate attorneys in-house is a compelling differentiator versus wirehouses.

Your case study approach is smart - HNW prospects want proof points from similar situations, not generic investment performance. Tax savings and estate structuring outcomes provide concrete value demonstration.

This creates strong messaging hierarchy:
- **Primary:** Wealth transition expertise for life-changing financial moments
- **Proof:** Case studies showing tax optimization and estate planning outcomes  
- **Differentiator:** Boutique attention with institutional resources

Your value proposition is clear and conversion-tested. Ready to build your channel strategy? We'll match your sophisticated messaging to channels where HNW prospects are actively researching wealth management solutions.

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Excellent. $200K performance reserve (13%) gives you solid optimization capacity while keeping $1.3M in active deployment. That's disciplined budget management for precision HNW campaigns.

Your working budget becomes:
- **Tier 1:** $845K (65%)
- **Tier 2:** $325K (25%) 
- **Tier 3:** $130K (10%)
- **Performance Reserve:** $200K

This structure supports your longer HNW consideration cycles and allows rapid scaling of outperforming tactics.

Now for your value proposition - what's your core differentiator that resonates most with HNW prospects during their wealth transition moments? Is it specialized expertise, personalized service, tax optimization capabilities, or something else that sets LuxeFinance apart from Morgan Stanley and UBS?

Turn 12:
Excellent channel instincts. Your selections align perfectly with HNW research behavior and support sophisticated creative showcasing case studies.

**Channel Analysis:**

**LinkedIn (40-45% allocation):** Premium targeting, wealth transition content performs well, supports case study formats. Expect $400-600 CPL for HNW.

**Programmatic Display (25-30%):** Contextual targeting on financial sites, retargeting prospects. Lower CPL but longer attribution window.

**Connected TV (15-20%):** Brand building in top DMAs, premium positioning reinforcement. Harder to attribute but supports other channels.

**Podcast Sponsorships (10-15%):** High-intent audience, trusted environment. Financial shows like "Chat with Traders" or "Motley Fool Money."

**Financial Publisher Direct (5-10%):** Premium placement on WSJ/Barron's, immediate credibility.

Given your $600 CPL target is 25% below benchmarks, I'd weight toward LinkedIn and programmatic first - they offer the best targeting precision for your efficiency goals.

Which channel would you prioritize for initial testing and optimization?
