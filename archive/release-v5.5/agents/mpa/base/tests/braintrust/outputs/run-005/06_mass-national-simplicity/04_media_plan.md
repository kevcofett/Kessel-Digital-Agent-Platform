# Media Plan Output: Mass National Campaign - Simplicity Test

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect - I can see this is a national brand awareness launch for FreshBite Snacks with an $8M budget. You've mentioned brand lift studies for measurement, which is solid for awareness objectives.

To sharpen our outcome definition: What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with this awareness campaign? For example, are you looking to drive trial purchases, increase consideration for future purchase occasions, or establish market presence before a retail rollout?

Turn 3:
Perfect - 15% aided awareness lift and 12% consideration lift from zero baseline gives us clear success metrics. Those are solid targets for a new product launch in CPG.

Now let's assess if your efficiency expectations are realistic. With an $8M budget targeting adults 18-54 nationally, we're looking at roughly 180 million people in that demo.

$8M / 180M people = approximately $0.04 per person reached, which projects to very broad but light frequency. For comparison, successful CPG awareness campaigns typically need $0.08-$0.15 per person to drive meaningful lift.

This suggests we'll need to either focus on a smaller geographic rollout, tighten the audience definition, or adjust lift expectations. Which direction feels most aligned with your launch strategy?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Excellent - establishing market presence and driving consideration for grocery store purchases is a clear brand-building objective.

Now I need to understand how you'll measure success as a number. You mentioned brand lift studies, which is the right approach for awareness campaigns. 

What specific brand lift target are you aiming for? For example, are you looking to achieve 10% aided awareness lift, 15% consideration lift, or do you have a different benchmark in mind for measuring whether this $8M investment successfully builds that awareness foundation?

Turn 5:
Excellent - families with kids who buy premium/better-for-you snacks is a much stronger target. That combination typically represents about 35-40M adults nationally.

$8M / 35M people = approximately $0.23 per person, which projects to solid frequency and aligns well with successful CPG awareness benchmarks. This efficiency should support your 15% awareness and 12% consideration lift targets.

Quick validation: Does this audience size feel right for your retail strategy? With 35-40M people, we're talking about reaching roughly 15-20% of all US adults, but they'll be the highest-value prospects for FreshBite. Is that the right balance of focus versus broad market presence for your launch?

Turn 6:
Perfect - that targeting strategy sets up a much stronger foundation for success. We've established solid economics with your refined audience.

Now let's move to Step 3: Audience definition. You've identified families with kids who buy premium/better-for-you snacks as your core target - that's a great start.

To build precise targeting, what specific signals best identify these premium snack families? For example, do they shop at particular retailers like Whole Foods or Target, engage with specific brands like KIND or Annie's, or show certain online behaviors that would help us find them efficiently across media platforms?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Smart thinking - focusing on primary grocery shoppers with higher snack consumption will definitely improve efficiency. Adults 25-45 reduces our universe from 180M to approximately 85M people.

$8M / 85M people = roughly $0.09 per person, which gets us into the realistic range for meaningful brand lift in CPG.

To refine this core audience further, what other signals define your best snack buyers? For example, are you targeting families with kids, health-conscious consumers, premium snack buyers, or specific lifestyle segments? Even one or two additional filters could help us reach the 60-70M range where your budget really delivers impact.

Turn 7:
Excellent audience signals - those retail, brand, and content behaviors give us strong targeting precision.

Let me add a few more key signals that typically define this audience: they likely engage with organic/natural food content, follow family lifestyle influencers, use grocery apps like Instacart or store apps, and show interest in school lunch ideas or kid-friendly healthy recipes.

This audience profile should translate well across channels - we can find them through retailer partnerships, programmatic targeting on parenting and wellness sites, and social platforms where they engage with family content.

Now for Step 4: Geography. You mentioned nationwide distribution is already committed. Should we allocate your $8M evenly across all markets, or are there specific regions where this premium better-for-you positioning tends to perform stronger? For example, do you see higher performance in certain DMAs or regions?

Turn 8:
Smart regional weighting strategy. Let me structure this geographically with your 60/40 allocation.

For the high-performance markets (60% = $4.8M), I'm thinking major DMAs like:
- West Coast: Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland
- Northeast: New York, Boston, Philadelphia, DC
- Select metros: Denver, Austin, Dallas, Atlanta, Chicago

The remaining 40% ($3.2M) would cover all other DMAs to maintain national presence.

Before I build the full geographic breakdown, are there any specific markets you definitely want prioritized in that top tier, or any markets where the better-for-you positioning typically underperforms that we should deprioritize?

Turn 9:
Perfect - I'll prioritize San Francisco, Seattle, Denver, and Austin in the top tier, with lighter investment in price-sensitive smaller markets.

Now for Step 5: Budget allocation. With your $8M total budget, we need to determine the split between working media and production costs.

For a national awareness campaign with creative across multiple channels, production typically runs 15-20% of total budget. That would mean roughly $1.2-1.6M for creative development, leaving $6.4-6.8M in working media.

Does that production range feel appropriate for developing creative assets across the channels you'll need, or do you have a different expectation for the working media versus production split?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 10:
Excellent - $1.5M for production and $6.5M working media gives you strong creative firepower and substantial reach capacity.

Now for Step 6: Value proposition. Since this is a new snack line positioned as premium better-for-you, your messaging needs to break through in a crowded category.

For families buying premium snacks, what's the core benefit that makes FreshBite different? Is it specific ingredients (like no artificial flavors, organic, non-GMO), a unique product format, taste that doesn't sacrifice for health, or something else that gives busy parents permission to feel good about this snack choice?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 11:
Perfect - "guilt-free indulgence for the whole family" with clean, pronounceable ingredients is a compelling positioning that differentiates from both traditional indulgent snacks and overly health-focused options.

This messaging should resonate strongly with your target families who want treats their kids will actually eat but ingredients they can feel good about.

Now for Step 7: Channels. With $6.5M working media targeting 35-40M premium snack families nationally, we need channels that deliver both reach and the right context for your guilt-free indulgence message.

Based on your audience and objectives, I'm thinking a mix weighted toward video for emotional storytelling, plus targeted digital to reach families in relevant moments. What channels are you most interested in exploring, or do you have any constraints I should know about?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 12:
Perfect channel thinking - video storytelling with targeted digital support aligns well with your objectives and audience.

Here's my recommended allocation for your $6.5M working media:

**TV/CTV: $3.9M (60%)**
- Linear TV: $2.3M for broad family reach during relevant dayparts
- CTV: $1.6M for premium targeting and completion rates

**YouTube: $1.6M (25%)**
- Focus on family lifestyle, parenting, and recipe content

**Display: $1.0M (15%)**
- Programmatic targeting on parenting sites, meal planning apps, grocery platforms

This gives you strong video frequency (TV/CTV) for emotional connection, targeted video (YouTube) in relevant content moments, plus display to catch families in snack consideration contexts.

Does this allocation feel right for driving your awareness and consideration targets, or would you adjust the weighting between any channels?

Turn 13:
Excellent - that channel mix gives you the reach foundation and targeted precision to drive meaningful lift. The daypart strategy for linear TV around after-school and weekend family moments is spot-on for your audience.

Now for Step 8: Measurement. You've already identified brand lift studies as your primary measurement approach, which is perfect for awareness objectives. 

For your 15% awareness and 12% consideration targets, how frequently do you want to measure? Most CPG brands run brand lift studies every 4-6 weeks during active campaigns to track progress and optimize. Also, are you planning any secondary metrics like brand search volume or website traffic to supplement the lift studies?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 14:
Perfect measurement framework - brand lift every 4-6 weeks with brand search, website traffic, and social engagement as leading indicators gives you both validation and optimization signals.

Now for Step 9: Testing. With a $6.5M working budget, we have capacity to test and optimize during flight. 

What aspects are you most interested in testing? For example, we could test creative variations of your "guilt-free indulgence" messaging, different audience segments within your target families, or channel performance optimization. Given this is a new product launch, is there any part of the strategy you'd want to validate early before scaling fully?
