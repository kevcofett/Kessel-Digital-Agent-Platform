# Media Plan Output: Aggressive KPI - Must Narrow to Achieve

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start - you've given me solid foundation data. Let me analyze your efficiency target:

**$750K / 5,000 customers = $150 CAC exactly**

Your 16x LTV/CAC ratio ($2,400/$150) is exceptionally strong and gives us excellent margin for optimization. $150 CAC for B2B SaaS is aggressive but achievable with precise targeting.

Your SMB logistics audience definition is sharp - companies stuck on spreadsheets represents a clear pain point we can target effectively.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 5,000 new customers? For example, is this about hitting an ARR milestone, market expansion, or preparing for a funding round?

Turn 3:
Perfect - annual contracts with upfront cash flow significantly strengthens your position. That 9-10 month payback with annual collection is very healthy for B2B SaaS.

Your economics are solid:
**$200/month × 12 months = $2,400 LTV**
**9-10 month payback with annual collection = strong cash flow**

Starting at $200 CAC and optimizing to $150 is a realistic path. High-performing B2B SaaS campaigns typically see 20-30% efficiency gains through audience refinement and creative optimization over 6-12 months.

Now let's define your primary success metric. Since you're driving toward $12M ARR, I recommend tracking **new customer acquisitions** as your primary KPI rather than traditional ROAS, which can be misleading for subscription businesses.

Your target: **5,000 new customers by year-end**

Does this timeline mean you need all 5,000 customers acquired and onboarded by December 31st, or can some be in-flight? This affects our pacing strategy and measurement windows.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Excellent - doubling to $12M ARR is a clear, ambitious outcome that justifies aggressive targeting. The logistics digitization timing creates urgency that supports your efficiency goals.

Let me validate your economics against B2B SaaS benchmarks:

**Your Target: $150 CAC with $2,400 LTV = 16x ratio**
**Market Benchmark: B2B SaaS typically sees 3-5x LTV/CAC**

Your target is highly aggressive. Market data shows SMB SaaS CAC typically ranges $200-$400. To hit $150 CAC, we'll need extremely tight audience definition and channel efficiency.

The positive: Your strong unit economics give us room to test and optimize. If we start at $200 CAC and optimize down, you're still profitable.

Based on your $2,400 LTV, what's the typical contract value and payback period? Understanding if this is monthly subscriptions building to $2,400 over time versus larger upfront deals will impact our acquisition strategy and measurement approach.

Turn 4:
Got it - 5,000 signed customers generating MRR by December 31st. That's a hard deadline with Series B implications, which means we need to account for your sales cycle in our media planning.

Quick question on timing: What's your typical sales cycle from first marketing touchpoint to signed customer? For example, if someone clicks an ad today, how long until they're typically generating MRR?

This matters because if you have a 60-day sales cycle, we need prospects entering the funnel by early November to count toward your year-end target. Understanding this timeline will shape our pacing strategy and help ensure we're not generating leads too late to convert this year.

Turn 5:
Exactly right - front-loading Q3 and early Q4 is critical with that 45-60 day cycle plus budget approval time. We'll need strong lead flow by early November to hit December targets.

Your economics assessment is complete:
- **Target efficiency: $150 CAC (aggressive but achievable)**  
- **Starting point: $200 CAC with optimization path to $150**
- **Timeline constraint: Front-loaded spend through early November**

This creates a feasibility challenge: aggressive efficiency targets with compressed timeline and front-loaded spend. We'll need precise audience targeting from day one rather than gradual optimization.

Let's move to audience definition. You mentioned SMB logistics managers at companies with 50-500 employees, $5M-$50M revenue, stuck on spreadsheets or legacy TMS. 

What specific job titles convert best for you currently? For example, do you see better conversion from "Logistics Manager" versus "Operations Director" versus "Supply Chain Manager"?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Perfect - those title insights are gold for targeting precision. The daily pain point connection with Logistics and Transportation Managers makes sense for faster conversions.

**Primary targets: Logistics Manager, Transportation Manager, Warehouse Manager**
**Secondary: Operations Director (longer cycle but converts)**
**Avoid: Supply Chain Manager (mixed results)**

Now let's layer in behavioral signals. Beyond job titles, what other characteristics separate your best customers from prospects who don't convert? 

For example, do companies using specific legacy systems (like particular TMS software) convert better? Or do you see patterns around shipping volume, number of locations, or specific pain points they mention during sales calls?

Turn 7:
Excellent behavioral signals - this gives us laser-focused targeting criteria:

**Volume sweet spot: 100-1,000 shipments/month**
**High-intent signals: Multi-location (3-5 facilities), Excel/basic WMS users**
**Pain point triggers: Route optimization struggles, no real-time tracking, manual data entry**

**Avoid: <100 shipments (too small) or >1,000 shipments (enterprise needs)**

This precision targeting should help us hit that aggressive $150 CAC target. Companies in this profile have clear, urgent pain and budget to solve it.

One more audience question: Do you see geographic patterns in your best customers? Are there regions where logistics companies are more digitization-ready, or does shipping density/infrastructure affect conversion rates?

Turn 8:
Perfect geographic insights - distribution hubs and manufacturing regions with high logistics density are exactly where we should focus.

**Primary markets: Northeast corridor, Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, Ohio, North Carolina, Texas**
**Secondary: LA, Bay Area, Pacific Northwest (higher competition/CACs expected)**
**Avoid: Rural markets (lower volume, price-sensitive)**

This geographic focus aligns perfectly with your volume targets - these regions have the shipping density and digitization readiness to support $150 CAC efficiency.

Your audience definition is now complete and highly precise:
- Job titles with daily logistics pain
- 100-1,000 shipments/month sweet spot  
- Multi-location operations (3-5 facilities)
- Excel/basic WMS users in high-density logistics markets

What's your budget allocation preference across these geographic markets? Should we weight toward the proven Northeast/Midwest markets, or do you want meaningful investment in the higher-competition California markets to test scalability?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Smart allocation strategy - prioritizing proven efficiency over risky volume expansion makes perfect sense with your aggressive timeline and board pressure.

**Geographic budget allocation:**
**70% ($525K): Northeast, Midwest, Texas - proven $150-200 CAC markets**
**30% ($225K): California, Pacific Northwest - test markets with higher CAC tolerance**

This gives you $525K in your efficiency sweet spot to drive the majority of your 5,000 customers, while $225K tests scalability without jeopardizing core targets.

Now let's build your value proposition. Given your audience's daily pain points - route optimization headaches, no real-time tracking, manual spreadsheet hell - what's your strongest competitive differentiator? 

For example, is it fastest implementation, easiest migration from Excel, best ROI story, or something else that makes logistics managers choose SwiftDeliver over alternatives?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 10:
Perfect - that 30-day implementation versus 6+ months is a killer value prop for time-pressed logistics managers. The immediate ROI proof (15-20% fuel savings, 3-4 hours saved daily) provides concrete justification for budget approval.

**Core value proposition: "From Excel to optimized routes in 30 days"**
**Supporting proof points: 15-20% fuel cost reduction, 3-4 hours admin time saved daily**
**Competitive advantage: 30 days vs 6+ months for traditional TMS**

This messaging framework should resonate strongly with your target audience's urgency and pain points.

Now let's validate your budget allocation. With $750K total:

**$525K in proven markets targeting 3,500 customers = $150 CAC**
**$225K in test markets targeting 1,500 customers = $150 CAC**

Does this volume split feel realistic, or should we adjust expectations for the California test markets where you mentioned CACs run higher?
