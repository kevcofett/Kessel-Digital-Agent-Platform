# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience Unified Media Plan

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Your setup is excellent - three distinct segments with $3M targeting 25,000 total enrollees. That implies $120 per enrollee ($3M ÷ 25,000 = $120 CAC). This looks achievable for health insurance based on industry benchmarks.

Before we dive into segment-specific strategies, what's the primary business outcome you're trying to achieve? Are you focused on enrollment volume, premium revenue growth, or long-term member value?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Enrollment volume is your primary objective with 25,000 new members as the key target. That gives us a clear success metric.

Now for the economics - your $120 implied CAC looks solid for health insurance. To validate this efficiency target, what's the typical annual premium value for each segment? Even rough ranges help - for example, do Young Professionals average around $3,000 annually while Pre-Medicare might be closer to $6,000?

This helps us assess if $120 acquisition cost creates healthy unit economics across all three segments.

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent! Let me model this out:

**Young Professionals**: $3,000 avg premium ÷ $120 CAC = 25x ratio
**Families**: $5,000 avg premium ÷ $120 CAC = 42x ratio  
**Pre-Medicare**: $5,750 avg premium ÷ $120 CAC = 48x ratio

These ratios look very healthy for insurance, where first-year premium to CAC ratios of 20x+ are typically strong. Your blended efficiency target is definitely achievable.

You're right that segment-level tracking will be crucial - the Pre-Medicare and Family segments offer much more CAC flexibility if needed, while Young Professionals will need tighter efficiency.

Now let's dive deeper into your audience definition. Starting with Young Professionals - beyond the demographics you mentioned (26-35, urban metros, health-conscious), what behavioral signals best identify your ideal prospects? For example, do they typically research online first, respond better to convenience messaging, or show specific digital behaviors?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Perfect! Young Professionals are clearly digital-native with strong convenience and transparency motivations. The freelancer/startup angle is valuable - that's a specific pain point we can target.

Now for the Family segment - you mentioned suburban parents 35-50 focused on comprehensive coverage and cost predictability. What behavioral signals help identify your best family prospects? Do they research differently than Young Professionals, or engage with specific types of content like parenting resources, school district info, or family financial planning?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Excellent insights! Families are clearly more collaborative decision-makers with strong community ties. The back-to-school and AEP timing windows are valuable, and the "what if" scenario messaging addresses their core anxieties.

Now for Pre-Medicare - you mentioned they're 55-64, concentrated in FL, AZ, TX, focused on stability and network quality. What behavioral signals identify your best Pre-Medicare prospects? Do they research through different channels, perhaps more traditional sources, or engage with retirement planning content?

Turn 6:
Perfect! Pre-Medicare clearly values relationship-driven service and continuity messaging. The "gap years" positioning is particularly smart.

Now let's look at geography. You mentioned specific concentrations:
- Young Professionals: NYC, SF, LA, Chicago metros
- Families: Suburban markets around top 50 metros  
- Pre-Medicare: Heavy in FL, AZ, TX

Within these geographies, are there specific DMAs or sub-markets that perform particularly well for TrueHealth? For instance, do certain suburban markets around major metros show stronger family enrollment, or specific Florida markets that over-index for Pre-Medicare?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Great insights! Those growth markets like suburban Dallas/Atlanta/Phoenix for families and tech hubs like Austin/Denver for Young Professionals make perfect sense. Tampa-St. Pete and Phoenix for Pre-Medicare align with retirement migration patterns.

Now for budget allocation across your three segments. With $3M total and 25,000 enrollees targeted, we need to decide how to split investment. 

Given the different CAC flexibility we calculated earlier (families and Pre-Medicare can support higher CACs), and your market observations, how are you thinking about the enrollment split? For example, are you targeting 8,000-8,000-9,000 roughly equal, or does one segment get weighted higher based on strategic priorities or market opportunity?

Turn 8:
Let me run those numbers:

**Families**: 40% = $1.2M ÷ 10,000 = $120 CAC
**Pre-Medicare**: 35% = $1.05M ÷ 8,500 = $124 CAC  
**Young Professionals**: 25% = $750K ÷ 6,500 = $115 CAC

This allocation is smart strategically. You're investing most heavily in Families where you have the highest premium values ($5,000 avg) and strong market momentum. Pre-Medicare gets solid investment matching their LTV potential. Young Professionals get efficient spending that respects their tighter economics.

All three CACs stay close to your $120 blended target, which validates the approach.

Now let's define your value propositions for each segment. Starting with Families - given their focus on comprehensive coverage and cost predictability, what's your core message that differentiates TrueHealth from competitors?

Turn 9:
Excellent! "Complete family coverage with no surprises" perfectly addresses their core anxiety about cost predictability. The family deductible structure and children's hospital networks are strong differentiators, and the 24/7 nurse hotline is brilliant for the "what if" scenarios that keep parents up at night.

Now for Young Professionals - given their focus on convenience, transparency, and flexibility, what's TrueHealth's core value proposition for this segment? How do you differentiate from competitors targeting the freelancer/startup worker market?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Perfect! "Health insurance that works as hard as you do" speaks directly to their hustle mentality. The mobile-first platform, cross-state flexibility for remote workers, and fitness app partnerships show you really understand this segment's lifestyle.

Now for Pre-Medicare - given their focus on stability, network quality, and the transition to Medicare, what's TrueHealth's core value proposition? How do you address their concerns about continuity of care and the gap years before Medicare?
