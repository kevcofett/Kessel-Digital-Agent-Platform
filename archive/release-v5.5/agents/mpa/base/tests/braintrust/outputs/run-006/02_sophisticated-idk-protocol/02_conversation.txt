USER:
Hey, I'm the growth lead at QuickSend. We're a remittance fintech looking to acquire 10,000 new users this quarter with a $500K media spend. Let's build out the media strategy.

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start - you've given me clear volume and budget targets. $500K / 10,000 = $50 per user acquisition, which is tight but achievable for fintech.

For your business outcome, when you say "acquire users" - are you focused on registered users who complete onboarding, or users who complete their first remittance transaction? This affects how we measure success and optimize campaigns.

TURN 2 (Step 3)

USER:
Good question - we're definitely focused on users who complete their first transaction. Registration is easy but getting that first remittance is where the real value kicks in. I'd say about 60% of our registered users actually send money within the first 30 days, so we need to factor that conversion into the planning.

AGENT:
Excellent - first transaction is the right success metric. That 60% conversion rate is actually quite strong for fintech onboarding.

This changes our efficiency calculation significantly:
- $500K / 10,000 first transactions = $50 per transacting user
- But with 60% conversion, we need 16,667 registrations to get 10,000 transactions
- $500K / 16,667 registrations = $30 per registration

So we're targeting $30 per registration with 60% converting to first transaction.

For remittance, I'm modeling a 2-3% take rate assumption. If average first transaction is $300, that's $6-9 revenue per user immediately. What's your typical first transaction amount, and do you have data on customer lifetime value after that first send?

TURN 3 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our average first transaction is around $250, so your math looks pretty solid there. I honestly don't have great visibility into our lifetime value metrics - that's something our finance team is still working on tracking properly. From what I can gather, users who complete that first transaction typically send again within 60 days, but I'd need to dig deeper for precise LTV numbers. Can you model based on industry benchmarks for now?

AGENT:
Got it. I'll model using industry benchmarks for remittance LTV and you can refine anytime.

Based on fintech remittance data, users who complete first transactions typically generate $75-120 LTV over 12 months. I'll use $90 LTV as a conservative estimate.

Here's what your economics look like:
- $50 cost per transacting user
- $90 estimated LTV  
- 1.8x LTV/CAC ratio

At $250 average first transaction with 2.5% take rate, you generate ~$6.25 immediately, meaning 11-month payback period. This is aggressive but workable if retention holds.

Your $50 efficiency target is ambitious for remittance. Market typically shows $60-80 per transacting user based on compliance requirements and trust-building needed. To hit $50, we'll need precise audience targeting and high-converting channels.

Moving to Step 3 - who is your ideal customer for that first remittance transaction?
