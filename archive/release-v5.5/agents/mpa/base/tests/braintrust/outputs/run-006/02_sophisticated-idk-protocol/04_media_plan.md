# Media Plan Output: Sophisticated User - IDK Protocol

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start - you've given me clear volume and budget targets. $500K / 10,000 = $50 per user acquisition, which is tight but achievable for fintech.

For your business outcome, when you say "acquire users" - are you focused on registered users who complete onboarding, or users who complete their first remittance transaction? This affects how we measure success and optimize campaigns.

Turn 3:
Got it. I'll model using industry benchmarks for remittance LTV and you can refine anytime.

Based on fintech remittance data, users who complete first transactions typically generate $75-120 LTV over 12 months. I'll use $90 LTV as a conservative estimate.

Here's what your economics look like:
- $50 cost per transacting user
- $90 estimated LTV  
- 1.8x LTV/CAC ratio

At $250 average first transaction with 2.5% take rate, you generate ~$6.25 immediately, meaning 11-month payback period. This is aggressive but workable if retention holds.

Your $50 efficiency target is ambitious for remittance. Market typically shows $60-80 per transacting user based on compliance requirements and trust-building needed. To hit $50, we'll need precise audience targeting and high-converting channels.

Moving to Step 3 - who is your ideal customer for that first remittance transaction?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Excellent - first transaction is the right success metric. That 60% conversion rate is actually quite strong for fintech onboarding.

This changes our efficiency calculation significantly:
- $500K / 10,000 first transactions = $50 per transacting user
- But with 60% conversion, we need 16,667 registrations to get 10,000 transactions
- $500K / 16,667 registrations = $30 per registration

So we're targeting $30 per registration with 60% converting to first transaction.

For remittance, I'm modeling a 2-3% take rate assumption. If average first transaction is $300, that's $6-9 revenue per user immediately. What's your typical first transaction amount, and do you have data on customer lifetime value after that first send?
