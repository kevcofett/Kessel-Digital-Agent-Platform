# Media Plan Output: Brand Building with Limited Data

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect setup - natural supplements expanding to the West Coast with a solid $500K budget. For brand awareness campaigns, I need to understand your business objective clearly.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with this brand awareness campaign? For example, are you looking to drive online sales, get people into retail locations, build email signups, or something else?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect! Online sales with email list building as a secondary benefit. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success.

What's your primary number for measuring success? For example, are you targeting a specific number of new customers, a total revenue amount, or something else? And what's your target - how many new customers or how much revenue are you aiming for with this $500K investment?

Turn 3:
Let me run the numbers to see what your targets imply:

**Customer Acquisition Math:**
- $500K ÷ 2,500 customers (midpoint) = $200 per customer
- $500K ÷ 3,000 customers = $167 per customer

**Revenue Efficiency Check:**
- $875K revenue (midpoint) ÷ $500K spend = 1.75x return
- That means each customer needs to spend $350 average ($875K ÷ 2,500)

For natural supplements, $167-200 per customer acquisition is aggressive but achievable with tight targeting. The bigger question is whether new customers will spend $350 on their first purchase, since that's what your revenue target requires.

What's your typical first-time customer order value? Do new customers usually buy one product around $50-80, or do they often purchase bundles worth $200-300+?

Turn 4:
Exactly right! Your first-purchase reality is much more grounded. Let me show you the corrected math:

**Realistic Revenue Projection:**
- 2,500 new customers × $100 average first order = $250K revenue
- $250K revenue ÷ $500K spend = 0.5x return on first purchase

This is actually normal for supplements! Most successful brands lose money on first purchase and profit on repeat orders.

The key question becomes: what's a typical customer worth over their lifetime with you? Do customers who start with that $100 first order usually come back and spend another $200-400 over the next 6-12 months?

If your customer lifetime value is $300-400, then spending $200 to acquire them makes perfect sense. What does your repeat purchase data show for customer value over time?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Got it. I'll model using $300 lifetime value based on your estimates - that's conservative given your 40-50% repeat rate and $150-200 second orders. You can refine this as you gather more data.

At $200 cost per customer with $300 lifetime value, that's a 1.5x ratio, which is tight but workable for a new market launch. Many successful supplement brands operate at these ratios initially.

So we're modeling: 2,500 new customers, $200 per acquisition, $300 estimated lifetime value. This gives us a realistic foundation.

Now let's assess if that $200 efficiency is achievable. For natural supplements launching in a new market with brand awareness focus, acquisition costs of $150-250 are typical. Your target sits right in that range.

Are you comfortable moving forward with 2,500 customers as our target, knowing we'll track actual lifetime value closely to validate the economics?

Turn 6:
Perfect! 2,500 customers at $200 per acquisition gives us a solid, realistic foundation. The economics work for a new market launch, and you're right to plan better lifetime value tracking - that data will be crucial for optimizing future campaigns.

Now let's define your target audience. Since you're launching into California, Oregon, and Washington without historical data, we need to build a clear picture of who's most likely to buy natural supplements online.

Who do you think your ideal customer is? For example, are you targeting health-conscious millennials, wellness-focused Gen X, or a broader demographic? Any insights on age, lifestyle, or interests that define your best prospects?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Excellent! Health-conscious millennials and Gen Z (25-40) who prioritize quality, research purchases, and share wellness journeys - that's a well-defined audience with strong digital behaviors.

Let me dig deeper on one key aspect: within that wellness-focused group, are there specific interests or behaviors that make someone more likely to buy supplements online? 

For example, are your best prospects people who are already buying supplements and might switch brands, or are you targeting people new to supplements who are just starting their wellness journey? This affects how we find and message them.

Turn 8:
Perfect! That's a much more targeted profile - existing supplement users seeking higher quality, values-aligned brands. These prospects already have purchase intent and budget allocated, they just need to discover you.

This is actually ideal for efficient acquisition since you're not educating people about supplements generally, just convincing them to switch to your brand.

One more audience question: within the West Coast, do you see any geographic priorities? For example, are you equally focused on all of California, Oregon, and Washington, or do certain metro areas like LA, SF, Seattle, or Portland feel more important for your brand launch?
