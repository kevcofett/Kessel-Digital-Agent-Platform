# Media Plan Output: Precision Targeting with Complex Attributes

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I am excited to build a media plan with you. We will cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Your sophisticated brief gives us excellent foundation data. Let me start with a quick efficiency check: $1.5M ÷ 2,500 = $600 per qualified lead. This is aggressive but achievable for HNW targeting given the audience value.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 2,500 qualified leads? For example, are you targeting a specific AUM acquisition number, new client conversion rate, or revenue goal from this cohort?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect. Your math validates strong unit economics: 2,500 leads × 9% conversion × $2.5M AUM = $562M, hitting your $500M target. At $5M first-year revenue, that's $600 cost per lead against $2,000 revenue per lead - excellent 3.3x first-year ROAS before considering LTV.

Your primary KPI is qualified leads, but given the sophisticated sales process for HNW clients, what defines "qualified" in your CRM? Is it based on asset verification, specific engagement behaviors, or sales team qualification criteria?

Turn 4:
Outstanding economics. Even at conservative $50K LTV, your $600 CPL represents just 1.2% of lifetime value - extremely healthy unit economics that give you significant bidding power in competitive markets.

$50K LTV ÷ $600 CPL = 83x LTV/CAC ratio. This means you can afford to push CPLs to $1,000+ in premium DMAs like NYC/SF and still maintain strong returns.

Your economics are solid. Let's move to audience definition. You've outlined the demographic and behavioral profile well. Given your 50K existing client CRM data, how closely does your current client base match this target profile? Are there any surprising segments or characteristics in your data that outperform expectations?

Turn 5:
Excellent insights. Female executives and younger liquidity event clients with higher conversion rates suggest opportunity for precision targeting beyond traditional HNW demographics.

Your CRM reveals two high-value micro-segments:
- Female executives (tech/healthcare) with higher engagement
- 35-44 liquidity event cohort with faster asset consolidation

This creates audience strategy options: broad HNW targeting for scale, or precision segments for efficiency. Given your quality-over-volume preference and strong unit economics, we could allocate budget toward these higher-converting segments.

For geographic targeting, you mentioned top HNW DMAs. Do you see performance differences across these markets in your current client data, or should we assume even distribution across NYC, SF, LA, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Denver, Miami, Dallas, DC?

Turn 6:
Perfect geographic intelligence. Your performance data clearly shows where to concentrate firepower:

**Tier 1 (Heavy Weight):** SF, Seattle, NYC, Miami - proven performance + strategic advantages
**Tier 2 (Standard):** Chicago, Boston - solid but competitive  
**Tier 3 (Test/Learn):** LA, Denver - promising but limited data

This suggests 60-70% budget allocation to Tier 1 markets, leveraging your equity comp expertise in tech hubs and tax optimization positioning in Miami.

Now for budget structure. With $1.5M total budget targeting 2,500 leads, should we think about this as one integrated campaign, or do you prefer separate budget allocations - perhaps by geography, audience segment, or lead funnel stage? Your multi-touch qualification process suggests we might want different budget treatments for prospecting versus nurture.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Excellent - that multi-touch qualification process explains your strong conversion rates. Your $600 per qualified lead efficiency is realistic given the behavioral depth required.

Now for economics validation. You mentioned LTV is significantly higher than first-year value. What's your typical client LTV in this segment? This helps us assess if we can potentially invest more aggressively for the right prospects, especially in competitive DMAs like NYC and SF where CPMs run higher.

Turn 8:
Powerful value proposition. Technology-enabled tax savings with quantifiable proof points - that $2.3M case study is marketing gold for this audience.

Your differentiation stack:
- **Proprietary tech platform** (unique capability)  
- **Credentialed expertise** (CFP + tax credentials + Big Four background)
- **Quantified outcomes** ($2.3M tax savings case study)
- **Interactive modeling tools** (high engagement + self-qualification)

The interactive planning tools are particularly smart - they serve as both lead magnets and qualification mechanisms while demonstrating your technical superiority.

Now for channels. Given your sophisticated audience, multi-touch qualification process, and geographic concentration in tech/finance hubs, which channels are you currently using, and where do you see the biggest opportunities for this $1.5M investment?

Turn 9:
Smart channel thinking. LinkedIn as your proven anchor with strategic expansion into higher-intent placements makes perfect sense for HNW targeting.

**Current Mix Assessment:**
- **LinkedIn:** Proven performer, executive reach ✓
- **Programmatic:** Underoptimized targeting opportunity  
- **CTV:** Strong brand lift, attribution challenges
- **Financial publishers:** High-intent audience alignment
- **Podcast sponsorship:** Executive/entrepreneur focus

Your interactive planning tools being high-converting suggests we should weight channels by their ability to drive qualified site engagement, not just lead volume.

For measurement, you mentioned attribution challenges with CTV. Given your multi-touch qualification process and long sales cycles, how are you currently tracking the customer journey from first touchpoint to qualified lead? Are you using first-touch, last-touch, or some form of multi-touch attribution modeling?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Excellent strategic thinking. Your budget architecture addresses both acquisition and conversion optimization:

**Structure:**
- 70% Prospecting ($1.05M) → 1,750 new leads
- 30% Nurture ($450K) → Converting 750 engaged prospects

**Prospecting Allocation:**
- 80% Broad HNW ($840K) 
- 20% Precision micro-segments ($210K)

$210K ÷ 350 precision leads = $600 CPL baseline, but these convert 15-20% higher, so effective CPL drops to $500-520. Smart efficiency play.

Your value proposition clearly centers on tax optimization and estate planning expertise, particularly for equity compensation complexity. Given the competitive landscape in wealth management, what differentiates LuxeFinance beyond these specializations? What specific proof points or credentials resonate most with prospects during that multi-touch engagement process?

Turn 10:
Attribution gaps are common with complex B2B sales cycles, and you're smart to flag this before scaling. Last-touch attribution will systematically undervalue your upper-funnel investments like CTV and podcast sponsorship.

**Immediate Measurement Framework:**
- **Campaign-level tracking:** Unique UTMs + dedicated landing pages by channel
- **Behavioral scoring:** Weight planning tool usage + multi-content downloads  
- **Cohort analysis:** Track lead quality by source over 90-day windows
- **Incrementality testing:** Geographic holdout tests for brand channels

For your $1.5M investment, I recommend allocating 5-10% budget to measurement infrastructure - proper attribution modeling and testing frameworks that prove channel contribution beyond last-touch.

Now for testing strategy. With your diversified channel approach and quality-focused objectives, what's your appetite for test budget allocation? Should we build in systematic A/B testing for creative, audiences, and channels, or focus testing on specific unknowns like financial publisher performance?

Turn 11:
Perfect testing philosophy - validate high-potential unknowns rather than optimize proven performers. 

**Testing Allocation Framework:**
- **5-10% Measurement infrastructure** ($75-150K)
- **15% Channel/audience testing** ($225K)
  - Financial publisher validation
  - Podcast sponsorship with proper attribution
  - Female executive precision targeting optimization

This leaves 75-80% for proven performance channels while building data for future scaling decisions.

Finally, let's address risks. You've identified attribution complexity as one challenge. Looking at your plan - $1.5M budget, aggressive $600 CPL target, channel diversification, and quality-focused objectives - what other risks concern you most? Market saturation in top DMAs, competitive response, or execution challenges?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 13:
Excellent - you're thinking like a true performance marketer by focusing on operational execution. Weekly cohort tracking is indeed critical when you're scaling at this pace and budget level.

**Implementation Timeline Estimate:**
- **Measurement infrastructure:** 4-6 weeks (UTM frameworks, attribution modeling, CRM integration)
- **Testing launch:** Week 6-8 (financial publishers, podcast sponsorship)
- **Full campaign scaling:** Week 10-12 (proven channels + validated new channels)

Your ops team alignment on weekly CRM data pulls is crucial - consider automated dashboards rather than manual reports to ensure consistency.

We've built a comprehensive media plan covering all ten strategic areas. Your $1.5M budget targeting 2,500 qualified leads at $600 CPL is achievable with strong unit economics (83x LTV/CAC ratio), tiered geographic strategy, diversified channel mix, and robust risk mitigation.

The combination of proven LinkedIn performance, strategic testing allocation, and quality-focused measurement should deliver your $500M AUM target while building sustainable competitive advantages in HNW acquisition.

Ready to execute this framework?

Turn 14:
Perfect execution mindset. You've built a sophisticated media plan that balances aggressive growth targets with quality-focused discipline - exactly what's needed for HNW acquisition at this scale.

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 12:
Excellent risk assessment. You've identified the three critical failure modes for scaled HNW acquisition:

**Risk Mitigation Framework:**

**Competitive Response:** 
- Geographic pacing with holdout markets to test cost inflation
- Channel diversification reduces dependence on any single auction
- Quality positioning vs. volume bidding strategies

**Market Saturation:**
- Audience modeling from your 50K CRM to find lookalike segments beyond obvious demographics  
- Sequential market entry vs. simultaneous scaling
- Expansion criteria: female executives → broader C-suite women → high-growth company leaders

**Lead Quality Degradation:**
- Weekly cohort quality tracking by source
- Conversion rate monitoring with 2-week lag alerts
- Channel-specific qualification thresholds

Your measurement infrastructure investment becomes insurance against these risks - early detection prevents budget waste on degraded channels.

We've built a solid strategic foundation: realistic economics, tiered geography, diversified channels, and risk-aware execution. Ready to move forward with this framework, or should we refine any elements before implementation?

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 15:
Great question on financial publisher selection. For HNW targeting, you want publications where your audience actively consumes wealth management content.

**Tier 1 Priority:**
- **Barron's** (excellent choice - HNW readership, tax/planning focus)
- **Financial Planning Magazine** (advisor-read but influences client decisions)
- **Wealth Management.com** (direct HNW audience, estate planning content)

**Tier 2 Testing:**
- **Forbes** (wealth sections, entrepreneur focus aligns with your liquidity event segment)
- **WSJ Wealth Advisor** (premium audience, tax optimization content)
- **ThinkAdvisor** (influences advisor recommendations to clients)

**Niche Opportunities:**
- **Entrepreneur Magazine** (younger liquidity event cohort)
- **Harvard Business Review** (executive audience, especially female C-suite)

Start with Barron's and Wealth Management.com for direct HNW reach, then test Forbes for your younger liquidity segment. The key is securing newsletter placements and content syndication, not just banner ads - your case studies and planning tools will perform better in editorial-style placements.

Consider negotiating performance-based pricing where possible, given your strong conversion tracking on qualified leads.
