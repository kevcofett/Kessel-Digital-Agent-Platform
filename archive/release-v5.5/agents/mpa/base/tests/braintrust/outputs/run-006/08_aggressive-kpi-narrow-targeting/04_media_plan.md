# Media Plan Output: Aggressive KPI - Must Narrow to Achieve

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect - you've given me excellent foundation data. Let me run the math on your targets:

**$750K / 5,000 customers = $150 CAC exactly**

At $2,400 LTV, that's a 16x LTV/CAC ratio - exceptionally healthy unit economics that gives us room for optimization and scale.

Your $150 CAC target is aggressive but achievable for B2B SaaS. Based on industry benchmarks, typical SaaS CACs range $100-$300 for SMB segments, so you're targeting the efficient end but within market reality.

Since you've defined both your business outcome (5,000 new customers) and efficiency target ($150 CAC), we can move to economics validation. 

One key question: What's your average sales cycle length from first touch to closed customer?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 3:
Perfect - that gives us 5 high-converting titles with clear pain point alignment. Logistics and Operations Managers are your sweet spot since they live the daily spreadsheet struggle.

Your audience definition is getting sharp. For efficient $150 CAC targeting, I need to understand geographic concentration.

What regions or metro areas generate your highest-value customers? Are you seeing better conversion and retention from specific geographic markets, or is performance fairly even across the US?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Excellent - 45-60 days is manageable for media optimization. That cycle length means we'll see conversion patterns emerge within 8-10 weeks, giving us solid feedback loops for campaign adjustments.

Your economics look strong. At $150 CAC with $2,400 LTV, you have healthy margins for testing and scaling. The 45-60 day cycle also means reasonable cash flow timing.

**Economics Assessment: Your targets are aggressive but realistic for B2B SaaS in the SMB segment.**

Now let's define your audience precisely. You mentioned SMB logistics managers at companies with 50-500 employees and $5M-$50M revenue, currently on spreadsheets or legacy TMS.

To build the most efficient targeting: What specific job titles are your highest-converting prospects? For example, do you see better conversion from "Logistics Manager" versus "Operations Director" versus "Supply Chain Manager"?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Excellent intel - logistics hub concentration makes perfect sense for your targeting efficiency. Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, and LA/Inland Empire as your power markets, with Texas overall performing strong.

The Northeast premium (20-30% higher CACs) is valuable context - we'll need to factor that into geographic budget allocation to maintain your $150 blended target.

For precise audience sizing and budget allocation, I need to map your target markets systematically. 

Should we focus primarily on your proven power markets (Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, LA/Inland Empire, plus broader Texas) for this $750K plan, or do you want to include expansion into other logistics hub markets like Memphis, Louisville, or the Northeast corridor despite higher CACs?

Turn 6:
Perfect - $750K annual budget with Q1/Q2 front-loading and mid-year expansion market validation requirements. That pacing gives us 6 months of Memphis/Louisville data for leadership review.

Your budget allocation is solid and the geographic strategy balances growth with efficiency targets.

**Step 4 Complete:** Proven markets (70%), Memphis/Louisville test (25%), Northeast selective (5-10%)

Now for your value proposition. You mentioned SMBs are "drowning in manual processes" and "stuck on spreadsheets." 

What's the primary business pain point that makes logistics managers take action fastest - is it the time waste of manual tracking, the errors from spreadsheet management, the lack of shipment visibility, or something else that creates urgency to switch from their current process?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Smart allocation strategy - 70% in proven markets protects your $150 CAC target while 25% in Memphis/Louisville and 5-10% Northeast gives you controlled expansion with learning opportunities.

Let me model this geographically:

**Proven Markets (70% = $525K):** Targeting 3,500 customers at ~$150 CAC
**Memphis/Louisville Test (25% = $187.5K):** Targeting 1,250 customers at $150 CAC (unproven efficiency)  
**Northeast Selective (5-10% = $37.5K):** Targeting 250 customers at $150-195 CAC

Your audience is well-defined: 5 high-converting job titles in logistics hub markets with clear geographic efficiency tiers.

Now let's validate your $750K budget allocation. Given your 70/25/5 geographic split and aggressive 5,000 customer target, does this budget feel sufficient, or are there constraints I should know about - like quarterly pacing requirements or board approval thresholds?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Brilliant - customer service crisis is your urgency driver. "Where's my order?" panic creates immediate action when logistics managers realize they're risking customer relationships.

That shifts your value prop from operational efficiency to customer retention protection. The fear of losing customers due to poor visibility trumps spreadsheet pain every time.

**Step 5 Complete:** Primary value prop is customer service protection/shipment visibility, secondary is operational efficiency.

Now let's validate your $750K budget against your targets. At $150 CAC for 5,000 customers, you're allocating every dollar to acquisition. 

Do you have additional budget for retention/expansion of existing customers, or is this $750K purely for new customer acquisition? Also, what's your current monthly recurring revenue run rate - I want to ensure this acquisition investment aligns with your growth trajectory.

Turn 8:
Excellent context - $480K MRR to ~$1.2M MRR represents aggressive but achievable 2.5x growth with your 92% retention supporting the investment thesis.

**$750K / 5,000 customers = $150 CAC exactly**

At $2,400 LTV and 92% retention, your payback math is solid. The board's market share grab strategy makes sense in fragmented SMB logistics.

**Economics validated:** Your $750K acquisition-only budget efficiently targets 5,000 customers at $150 CAC with strong unit economics.

Now for your channel strategy. Given your audience (logistics managers in hub markets), urgency driver (customer service crisis), and $150 CAC efficiency target, I'm seeing LinkedIn as your primary channel for precise job title targeting, plus Google Search to catch active problem-solvers.

What channels are you currently using, and what CACs are you seeing by channel?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Strong channel performance data - LinkedIn at $120-130 and Google Search at $140-160 both hit your $150 target, with LinkedIn offering superior efficiency.

**Current Performance Analysis:**
- LinkedIn: $125 avg CAC (17% below target) - excellent job title precision
- Google Search: $150 avg CAC (on target) - high intent capture  
- Review sites: $190 avg CAC (27% above target) - qualified but expensive

Given your aggressive 5,000 customer target, I'd recommend 60% LinkedIn ($450K for ~3,600 customers) and 35% Google Search ($262.5K for ~1,750 customers), leaving 5% ($37.5K) for review site testing in your highest-value markets only.

This allocation leverages your proven efficient channels while maintaining some review site presence where qualified intent justifies the premium.

Does this 60/35/5 split align with your channel capacity, or do you see constraints in scaling LinkedIn or Search volume at current CACs?

Turn 10:
Excellent strategic thinking - you're absolutely right about LinkedIn volume constraints. Scaling quality targeting 3x typically drives CAC inflation as you exhaust core audiences and face increased competition.

**Revised Allocation:**
- LinkedIn: 50% ($375K for ~3,000 customers at $125 CAC)
- Google Search: 40% ($300K for ~2,000 customers at $150 CAC)  
- Review Sites: 10% ($75K for ~400 customers at $188 CAC)

**Blended CAC: $141** - well under your $150 target with buffer for optimization.

This is more realistic for volume scaling while maintaining efficiency. Google Search's long-tail expansion and geographic reach gives you the headroom LinkedIn lacks.

For measurement, you'll need to track incrementality across channels since search often captures credit from LinkedIn's upper-funnel influence. 

What attribution model are you currently using, and do you have capabilities for incrementality testing to validate true channel contribution?

Turn 11:
You're spot-on about the attribution issue - LinkedIn likely drives significant search volume that Google captures credit for under first-touch. This is critical for your aggressive scale-up.

**Quick incrementality solutions:**
1. **Geo-holdout tests:** Turn off LinkedIn in 2-3 test markets for 4 weeks, measure Google Search volume drop
2. **Brand search monitoring:** Track branded search volume correlation with LinkedIn spend changes
3. **Sequential testing:** Pause/restart channels systematically and observe cross-channel impact

Given your 50/40/10 allocation and $141 blended CAC target, I'd recommend starting with brand search monitoring - it's simple but reveals LinkedIn's true influence when people search "SwiftDeliver" after seeing your ads.

Your measurement foundation needs this before aggressive scaling. LinkedIn's actual contribution is likely higher than first-touch shows, which could justify maintaining that 50% allocation.

Now for testing strategy. With $75K review site budget and expansion into Memphis/Louisville, what's your testing approach - will you run small pilots first, or launch full campaigns in new markets?

Turn 12:
Smart testing approach - $5-10K Memphis/Louisville pilots give you signal without major risk, and G2 focus makes sense for active TMS evaluators.

**Testing Framework:**
- Month 1: $10K each Memphis/Louisville + $10K G2 pilot
- Month 2: Scale winners, pause/pivot losers  
- Q1 end: Full data for Q2 leadership review

This balances speed with risk management for your timeline.

**Step 9 Complete:** Pilot-then-scale approach with monthly decision points.

Finally, let's identify your key risks. I see three major ones:

1. **LinkedIn volume ceiling** - May hit audience saturation before reaching 3,000 customers
2. **Attribution blindness** - Undervaluing LinkedIn's search influence could hurt optimization  
3. **Expansion market efficiency** - Memphis/Louisville CACs could exceed projections

What concerns you most about hitting your aggressive 5,000 customer target, and do you have contingency plans if your primary channels don't scale as expected?

Turn 14:
Perfect! You've built a strong plan that balances aggressive growth targets with realistic execution constraints. The systematic approach gives you clear decision points and backup options when you hit scaling challenges.

**Key next steps:**
1. Implement brand search monitoring this week
2. Socialize the 50/40/10 allocation with leadership  
3. Set up Memphis/Louisville pilot budgets ($10K each)
4. Prepare industry publication testing as LinkedIn backup

Your attribution fix will be game-changing - you'll finally see LinkedIn's true contribution and can optimize budget allocation with real data instead of guessing.

The plan positions you well to hit that aggressive 5,000 customer target while maintaining $150 CAC efficiency. You've got the strategic framework, risk mitigation, and contingencies to execute confidently.

Good luck with the leadership presentation - you've got solid data and reasoning behind every decision. Let me know if you need any support refining specific elements as you roll this out.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 13:
Excellent risk assessment - LinkedIn volume ceiling is your critical constraint, and attribution blindness could make it worse by misallocating budget away from your most efficient channel.

**Risk Mitigation Plan:**
1. **Implement brand search monitoring immediately** - before scaling, so you understand LinkedIn's true contribution
2. **Google Search expansion ready** - long-tail keywords and geographic reach as primary LinkedIn backup
3. **Industry publication testing** - LogisticsManagement.com, SupplyChainDive as LinkedIn alternatives
4. **Monthly volume monitoring** - LinkedIn audience saturation signals (rising CPMs, declining CTRs)

**Final Assessment:**
- **Target:** 5,000 customers at $150 CAC with $750K budget
- **Strategy:** 50% LinkedIn / 40% Google Search / 10% review sites  
- **Geography:** 70% proven markets / 25% expansion test / 5% Northeast selective
- **Timeline:** Q1-Q2 front-loaded with mid-year expansion validation

Your plan is aggressive but well-structured. The attribution fix and volume monitoring are critical success factors.
