# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience Unified Media Plan

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've provided excellent segment detail - that's exactly what we need for Step 3. But first, let's establish your foundation.

$3M budget targeting 25,000 enrollees equals $120 per enrollee. That's quite efficient for health insurance acquisition. What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve - is this about hitting enrollment quotas, expanding market share, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect - enrollment quota achievement with market share expansion gives us clear direction. Now let's nail down measurement so we can model this properly.

For your primary success metric, are you tracking new enrollees as the key number, or do you need to measure something like qualified leads that convert to enrollees? Health insurance often has a longer consideration cycle, so I want to make sure we're measuring the right thing.

Also, $3M / 25,000 = $120 per enrollee. Based on health insurance benchmarks, acquisition costs typically range $150-$400 per enrollee, so your target is quite aggressive. To hit $120, we'll need very tight audience targeting and channel efficiency. What's driving this efficiency target - is it based on your current performance or budget constraints?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it - enrollment quota with budget constraints means we need maximum efficiency. Your instinct about segment prioritization is spot-on.

Let me model this quickly: At $120 per enrollee, you're targeting the lower end of industry benchmarks. Young professionals converting faster could be your efficiency driver, while families and pre-Medicare might need longer nurture cycles.

Quick reality check - when you hit enrollment targets last year with a bigger budget, what was your actual cost per enrollee? Even a rough estimate helps me assess if $120 is achievable or if we need to recommend a different volume target to leadership.

This determines whether we're building an aggressive-but-possible plan or need to reset expectations upfront.

Turn 4:
Exactly right - your instincts are sound. $180-200 historically to $120 target is a 33-40% efficiency improvement needed. That's ambitious but not impossible with smart segment allocation.

Based on your input, I'd model something like:
- Young Professionals: 60% of budget ($1.8M) targeting 16,000 enrollees at $112 each
- Families: 25% of budget ($750K) targeting 6,000 enrollees at $125 each  
- Pre-Medicare: 15% of budget ($450K) targeting 3,000 enrollees at $150 each

This weights toward your fastest converters while keeping all segments active. The blended rate hits your $120 target.

Before we dive into audience details, does this allocation feel realistic based on your market opportunity in each segment? Or should we adjust the mix further toward young professionals?

Turn 5:
Perfect - let's adjust to 65% young professionals. That gives us:
- Young Professionals: $1.95M targeting 17,500 enrollees at $111 each
- Families: $750K targeting 6,000 enrollees at $125 each
- Pre-Medicare: $300K targeting 1,500 enrollees at $200 each

This keeps your blended rate at $120 while maximizing your efficiency play in urban metros.

Now we have solid economics. Let's build your audience strategy. You mentioned young professionals are gym members and health-conscious - beyond fitness behaviors, what other signals help identify your ideal 26-35 urban prospects? For example, income level, job titles, recent life events like new jobs or moves?

The more precise we get on each segment, the better we can hit these efficiency targets.

Turn 7:
Perfect - that longer research cycle explains why families need the higher CAC allocation. 4-6 weeks means multiple touchpoints and nurture sequences versus young professionals' quick digital conversion.

For pre-Medicare (55-64), you mentioned they focus on stability and network quality. What specific signals identify your best prospects in this segment? Are we looking at people currently on individual plans, early retirees, those with specific health conditions, or other indicators that they're actively evaluating coverage before Medicare kicks in?

Also, how long do they typically research - similar to families or even longer given the stakes of healthcare at that age?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Excellent - those are strong behavioral and life-event signals that should drive real efficiency. The age-off and job transition triggers are especially powerful since they create immediate need.

For families (35-50, suburban), what defines your ideal prospects beyond having kids under 18? Are you looking at specific household income thresholds, homeownership, certain types of employment, or particular family life stage indicators like recent moves to suburbs or kids starting school?

And do families typically research for weeks or months before enrolling, versus the young professionals who might decide in days?

Turn 9:
Perfect - that geographic precision will drive much better efficiency. Let me structure this into our targeting framework:

**YOUNG PROFESSIONALS (65% of budget - $1.95M)**
- DMAs: NYC, SF, LA, Chicago, Seattle, Austin, Denver
- Target: Ages 26-35, $60K+ income, urban cores
- Behavioral: Gym/fitness, wellness apps, health-conscious lifestyle
- Life events: Job transitions, recent moves, aging off parents' plans

**FAMILIES (25% of budget - $750K)**  
- Geographic clusters: Suburban counties around major metros
- Target: Ages 35-50, $75K+ household income, homeowners with kids <18
- Behavioral: Small business owners, school district research
- Life events: New babies, school enrollment, suburban relocation

**PRE-MEDICARE (10% of budget - $300K)**
- DMAs: Tampa, Orlando, Naples, Phoenix/Scottsdale, Austin, Dallas suburbs  
- Target: Ages 55-64, individual plan holders, early retirees
- Behavioral: Chronic condition management, provider network research
- Life events: Corporate retirement, relocation to retirement states

Does this capture your targeting strategy accurately before we move to budget allocation by geography?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Excellent - 2-3 month research cycles definitely justify that $200 CAC. The early retiree and chronic condition angles are smart targeting strategies.

Now let's map geography precisely. You mentioned young professionals in NYC, SF, LA, Chicago. For families in suburban markets around top 50 metros - are we talking about specific suburban counties around major cities? And for pre-Medicare being national but heavy in FL, AZ, TX - should we focus on specific metro areas within those states, or go broader?

The more precise we get geographically, the better we can allocate that budget and avoid waste in low-opportunity areas.

Turn 10:
Absolutely - you're right. Pre-Medicare enrollees are high-value, and that segment justifies the investment. Let me adjust:

**FINAL BUDGET ALLOCATION:**
- Young Professionals: 65% ($1.95M) targeting 17,500 enrollees at $111 each
- Families: 20% ($600K) targeting 4,800 enrollees at $125 each  
- Pre-Medicare: 15% ($450K) targeting 2,700 enrollees at $167 each

This keeps your blended rate right at $120 while properly funding the high-value pre-Medicare segment.

Now for value proposition - each segment needs different messaging. Young professionals likely care about convenience and digital experience. Families probably focus on comprehensive coverage and cost predictability. Pre-Medicare emphasizes network quality and stability.

What's your current brand positioning, and how does it need to flex differently for each audience to drive those conversions?

Turn 11:
Excellent - "Healthcare Made Simple" is flexible enough to resonate across all three segments with the right emphasis. Your messaging instincts are spot-on for each audience's core concerns.

**VALUE PROPOSITION FRAMEWORK:**

**Young Professionals:** "Healthcare Made Simple for Your Busy Life"
- Convenience: Mobile enrollment, digital provider lookup, telehealth
- Speed: Quick decisions, instant coverage verification
- Urban lifestyle fit: Network includes city specialists, urgent care

**Families:** "Healthcare Made Simple for Your Growing Family"  
- Predictability: Clear costs, no surprise bills, family deductibles
- Comprehensive: Pediatric networks, maternity, preventive care
- Peace of mind: Family-friendly providers, school physicals covered

**Pre-Medicare:** "Healthcare Made Simple for Life's Transitions"
- Stability: Consistent coverage bridge to Medicare
- Network quality: Established specialists, chronic condition management
- Transition support: Medicare planning, continuity of care

Now let's build your channel strategy. With these distinct audiences and messages, young professionals likely need heavy digital focus, families might need more traditional channels, and pre-Medicare could benefit from direct mail or educational content. What channels have worked best for you historically?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 12:
Great context - your instinct about different channel strategies is exactly right. For young professionals at that aggressive $111 CAC target, we need the most efficient digital channels with precise targeting.

**YOUNG PROFESSIONALS CHANNEL STRATEGY:**

**Search (40% of segment budget)** - High intent, immediate need when life events hit. Target "health insurance [city]", "individual coverage", "lost job insurance"

**Meta/Instagram (35%)** - Excellent life event targeting, gym/fitness interests, recent movers. Video creative showing quick enrollment process

**LinkedIn (15%)** - Job transition targeting, freelancer/contractor audiences, professional content

**Google Display/YouTube (10%)** - Retargeting and awareness in urban DMAs

The key is layering behavioral signals - someone who's a gym member + recent mover + works in tech + lives in SF urban core.

For families needing that longer nurture cycle and pre-Medicare's extended research phase, we'll need different approaches with more touchpoints and educational content.

What's your current search performance been like, and do you have good creative assets for social video?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 13:
Perfect - creative investment will be crucial for hitting those efficiency targets. Quick enrollment demos and lifestyle-focused content should perform well with young professionals.

Now for families and pre-Medicare - these longer research cycles need different approaches:

**FAMILIES (suburban, 4-6 week consideration):**
- Search + educational content marketing for "family health insurance" research
- Facebook targeting parents, homeowners in specific suburban counties
- Local digital radio/podcast sponsorships in school districts
- Retargeting with family-focused testimonials and cost calculators

**PRE-MEDICARE (2-3 month research cycle):**
- Educational webinar series about Medicare transition
- Targeted direct mail with improved messaging in FL/AZ/TX metros
- Search for "Medicare supplement" and "early retirement insurance"
- Email nurture sequences with network quality content

The longer cycles mean more touchpoints and educational content before conversion. Does this multi-touch approach align with your current capabilities, or would you need to build out content marketing and nurture infrastructure?

Turn 14:
Excellent point about timing - AEP deadlines don't wait for perfect infrastructure. Let's prioritize what you can launch quickly versus what needs longer development.

**QUICK WINS (30-45 days):**
- Search optimization with life event keywords
- Meta campaigns with existing creative + new mobile-first enrollment videos
- Basic email sequences using current content
- Direct mail refresh with new pre-Medicare messaging

**MEDIUM TERM (60-90 days):**
- LinkedIn campaigns and job transition targeting
- Webinar series development and promotion
- Marketing automation setup for nurture sequences
- Local podcast/radio partnerships

For measurement, you'll need to track differently across segments given the varying consideration cycles. Young professionals might convert in 3-7 days, families in 4-6 weeks, pre-Medicare in 2-3 months.

How sophisticated is your current attribution tracking, and can you measure cross-channel touchpoints for these longer customer journeys?
