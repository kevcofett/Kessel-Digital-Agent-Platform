# Media Plan Output: Basic User - Steps 1-2 Completion

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve? For example, are you looking to get more new customers, increase sales from existing customers, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Growing your customer base is a clear objective. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success.

What number would tell you this campaign is working? For example, is it the total number of new customers you want to bring in, or a specific dollar amount in new sales from first-time buyers?

Turn 4:
Excellent! Let's work with 2,500 new customers as your target - right in the middle of your range. That gives us a solid goal to build around.

Now I need to understand your economics to see if this target is realistic. How much can you afford to spend to get one new customer? For example, if a typical new customer spends $80 on their first order, you might be able to spend $30-40 to acquire them and still be profitable.

Turn 5:
Got it. I'll model using $35 cost per customer based on your price range - that's typically achievable for footwear businesses. You can refine this anytime after checking with your finance team.

At $35 per customer for 2,500 new customers, that projects to an $87,500 budget:

$35 × 2,500 = $87,500

Does a budget around $85-90K feel realistic for this campaign, or should we adjust either the customer target or the efficiency to better match what you can invest?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it - new customers is the right focus. To help figure out what's realistic, I need a rough target to work with.

How many new customers would feel like a meaningful win for you? Even a ballpark number helps - are we talking hundreds, a few thousand, or more? We can always adjust once we look at the budget and see what's achievable.

Turn 6:
Absolutely! With $250,000, you have much more capacity. Let me show you the math:

$250,000 ÷ $35 = 7,143 new customers

That's nearly triple your original target! This budget gives you serious growth potential.

However, I want to check if $35 per customer is realistic at that scale. Based on footwear industry benchmarks, customer acquisition costs typically range from $25-60 depending on your approach. Your $35 target is achievable but will require focused audience targeting and efficient channel selection.

Does going after 7,000+ new customers feel right for your business capacity, or would you prefer a more conservative target around 5,000 customers, which would give you some buffer room at $50 per customer?

Turn 7:
Smart thinking! 5,000 new customers with your $250K budget gives you a solid efficiency target:

$250,000 ÷ 5,000 = $50 per customer

That's conservative for footwear and builds in buffer for optimization. This efficiency is very achievable based on industry benchmarks, so you're setting yourself up for success.

Perfect - we've nailed down your foundation: 5,000 new customers at $50 per customer with your $250K budget. Now let's define who these customers should be.

Who is your ideal customer for StepRight Shoes? Think about demographics like age, gender, income level, or lifestyle - whoever is most likely to buy and become a repeat customer.
