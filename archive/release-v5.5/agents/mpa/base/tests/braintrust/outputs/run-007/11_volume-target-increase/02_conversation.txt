USER:
Hi, I'm the Marketing Manager at HomeStyle Direct. We're an e-commerce company selling home goods. I need to build a media plan for Q1-Q2. We have a $400K budget and need to acquire 5,000 new customers. Our average customer LTV is $320. Can you help me put together a plan?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've given me great foundational data. Let me start with a quick calculation: $400K ÷ 5,000 customers = $80 per customer acquisition cost. With your $320 LTV, that's a healthy 4x ratio - well above the 3x threshold for sustainable growth.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 5,000 new customers? For example, are you focused on revenue growth, market expansion, or building your customer base for future retention campaigns?

USER:
We're definitely focused on revenue growth - we want to hit our quarterly targets and show strong performance to leadership. Building our customer base is important too since we know repeat customers are valuable, but the immediate goal is driving sales and proving our marketing investment is working. We've been growing steadily but need to accelerate that growth in the first half of the year.

AGENT:
Perfect! Revenue growth with accountability to leadership - that's a clear objective. Your $80 CAC against $320 LTV gives you solid unit economics to work with.

Now I need to understand how you'll measure success. What's your primary metric for tracking progress? Will you focus on total revenue generated ($320 × 5,000 = $1.6M), new customer count (5,000), or something else like return on ad spend?

TURN 3 (Step 3)

USER:
We'll definitely be tracking both the 5,000 new customers and that $1.6M in revenue - leadership wants to see both numbers hit. But honestly, ROAS is probably the metric I'll be judged on most since that shows the efficiency of our spend. We typically aim for at least 4:1 ROAS to keep everyone happy, though I know with the $320 LTV we should be able to do better than that over time.

AGENT:
I need to flag something important about ROAS as your primary KPI. Platform-reported ROAS is often inflated by 20-40% due to attribution issues and doesn't capture incrementality - meaning some sales would have happened anyway without ads.

For leadership reporting and realistic forecasting, I'd recommend tracking both:
- **Immediate metric**: New customer acquisitions (concrete, auditable)
- **Efficiency metric**: Cost per new customer ($80 target, easy to calculate)

Your 4:1 ROAS target translates to $100 cost per $400 in attributed revenue. But if that $400 includes repeat purchases over time rather than just first purchase, the math gets complex.

What's the average first purchase value for new customers? This helps us set realistic efficiency expectations and avoid the ROAS attribution trap.

TURN 4 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
That's a really good point about ROAS being inflated - I hadn't thought about that attribution issue. Our average first purchase for new customers is around $85, so if we're targeting $80 CAC, we'd need the platforms to show about 1:1 ROAS on first purchase. I like your suggestion about tracking new customer acquisitions and cost per customer - that would definitely be cleaner for reporting to leadership and easier to track accurately.

AGENT:
Excellent - that math works perfectly. $85 first purchase with $80 CAC gives you $5 immediate contribution per customer, and the real value comes from your $320 LTV over time.

Let me model your economics: At $80 per customer targeting 5,000 customers, you're projecting a 4x LTV/CAC ratio. Based on home goods benchmarks, this is achievable but requires disciplined audience targeting since the efficiency window is tighter than categories with higher first-purchase values.

Your economics are solid and your success metrics are clear. We're ready to move to audience definition.

Who is your ideal customer? I need to understand both demographics (age, income, location type) and behaviors (shopping patterns, interests, how they discover home goods). The more precise we can be, the better we can hit that $80 efficiency target.

TURN 5 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our ideal customers are homeowners aged 30-55, typically with household incomes of $50K and up. They're usually in suburban areas and own their homes rather than rent. Most of them are women, though we do get some men too.

Behaviorally, they tend to shop online for convenience and like browsing Pinterest and Instagram for home décor inspiration. They're not necessarily buying furniture every month, but when they do make purchases, they want quality pieces that'll last. A lot of them discover us through social media or when they're actively searching for specific items on Google.

AGENT:
Great foundation! Let me get more specific on the behavioral signals that will help us hit your $80 efficiency target.

Beyond Pinterest and Instagram browsing, what specific shopping behaviors indicate someone is likely to buy from HomeStyle Direct? For example:

- Do they typically research products extensively before buying?
- Are they more likely to purchase during home renovation periods?
- Do they respond to seasonal trends (spring refresh, holiday decorating)?
- Are there life events that trigger purchases (new home, moving, major life changes)?

The more precisely we can identify high-intent signals, the better we can focus your $400K on customers most likely to convert at your target efficiency.

TURN 6 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Yeah, they definitely research quite a bit before buying - especially for bigger furniture pieces. We see a lot of people coming back to our site multiple times before purchasing. 

Spring is huge for us, probably our best season with people doing home refreshes. Holiday decorating in Q4 is good too. And you're spot on about life events - we get a lot of customers who just bought a new home or are moving. Those tend to be our highest-value customers since they're furnishing entire rooms or replacing multiple items at once.

We also notice people who engage with our email content about styling tips and room makeovers tend to convert better than those who just browse products.

AGENT:
Perfect - those behavioral signals give us strong targeting precision. Research-heavy buyers, seasonal refresh patterns, and life events are all trackable signals that should help us hit that $80 CAC target.

One more critical piece: Within your 30-55 homeowner audience, are there geographic patterns? Do you see better performance in certain regions, metro areas, or suburban types? 

For example, do customers in growing suburban markets convert differently than established suburbs? Any regional preferences for home styles that affect your product mix?

Understanding geographic performance will help us allocate your $400K efficiently across markets.

USER:
We sell nationwide, so we get customers from all over, but I've noticed we tend to do better in suburban markets in growing areas - places like Austin, Charlotte, Denver, Phoenix. Those markets seem to have more people moving into new homes or upgrading their spaces.

The Northeast and West Coast perform well too, though the customers there tend to have higher budgets and go for more premium pieces. We haven't really broken down performance by specific metro areas in detail, but I know our shipping costs are pretty consistent nationwide so geography isn't a huge factor from a logistics standpoint.

AGENT:
Excellent - that geographic insight is valuable. Growing suburban markets like Austin, Charlotte, Denver, and Phoenix align perfectly with your life-event triggers (new homes, moves), while Northeast and West Coast customers skew premium.

Your geography is solid: nationwide reach with performance patterns that make sense. Let's move to budget allocation.

You have $400K to acquire 5,000 customers at $80 each. How do you want to think about budget allocation? For example:

- Should we weight more heavily toward those high-performing growing markets?
- Any preference between focusing on fewer markets with deeper investment vs. broader national reach?
- Do you need to reserve any portion of the budget for retention/repeat customer campaigns, or is this $400K purely for new customer acquisition?

TURN 8 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
This $400K is purely for new customer acquisition - we have a separate budget for retention campaigns. I think we should definitely weight more heavily toward those high-performing growing markets since they seem to convert better and have more of our ideal life-event customers.

I'd lean toward broader national reach rather than going too deep in just a few markets, since we're trying to hit 5,000 customers and I don't want to saturate any single area. Maybe we allocate like 60% of the budget to those high-performing suburban growth markets and 40% to the rest of the country?

AGENT:
Smart allocation thinking. 60% to high-performing growth markets and 40% national gives you efficiency focus while maintaining scale to hit 5,000 customers.

That breaks down to $240K targeting ~3,000 customers in growth markets at $80 CAC, and $160K targeting ~2,000 customers nationally. The math works cleanly.

Now let's define your value proposition. When your ideal customer - that suburban homeowner researching quality pieces for their home refresh or new house - sees your ads, what core message will make them choose HomeStyle Direct over competitors?

Is it product quality, style selection, price point, convenience, or something else that differentiates you in their decision process?

TURN 9 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I think our main differentiator is that we offer quality pieces at accessible prices - not the cheapest stuff you'd find at big box stores, but not the premium prices of high-end furniture retailers either. We're kind of that sweet spot in the middle.

Our customers also really appreciate our styling advice and room inspiration content. A lot of our competitors just show individual products, but we help people visualize how pieces work together in actual rooms. That seems to resonate with people who want their homes to look put-together but aren't professional designers themselves.

And honestly, our customer service is pretty solid - we get good reviews on shipping times and handling any issues that come up, which matters when people are buying furniture online without seeing it in person first.

AGENT:
Perfect - that's a compelling value proposition. "Quality pieces at accessible prices" with styling guidance hits your research-heavy customers who want professional results without premium costs.

Your value prop is clear: accessible quality + design confidence + reliable service. That resonates strongly with your suburban homeowner audience doing home refreshes.

Now we're ready for channel strategy. Based on your $400K budget, $80 CAC target, and audience that discovers you through social media and Google searches, what channels are you currently using or considering?

I'm thinking about the mix that will efficiently reach your Pinterest-browsing, research-heavy customers across those growth markets while hitting your 5,000 customer target.
