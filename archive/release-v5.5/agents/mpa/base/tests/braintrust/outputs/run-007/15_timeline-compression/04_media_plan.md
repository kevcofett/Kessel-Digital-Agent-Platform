# Media Plan Output: Timeline Compression

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your business outcome. You mentioned acquiring 25,000 new customers - is customer acquisition your primary objective, or are you also focused on revenue growth, brand awareness, or retention alongside acquisition?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So customer acquisition is your primary objective with 25,000 new customers as your success target. 

Let me quickly check the economics: $1.2M ÷ 25,000 = $48 per customer acquisition cost. With your $180 LTV, that projects to a healthy 3.75x LTV/CAC ratio - well above the 3x threshold that high-performing fashion brands typically maintain.

Your target efficiency looks very achievable for fashion retail. The $48 CAC is conservative compared to typical fashion benchmarks of $45-65, which gives us good flexibility for channel mix and testing.

Since you mentioned building recognition in target metros, what specific urban markets are you prioritizing for this expansion?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent geographic strategy - mixing established metros with high-opportunity tier 2 markets is smart. Those secondary cities often deliver better efficiency due to lower competition while still having concentrated target demographics.

Now let's define your target customer more precisely. You mentioned your target demographic is showing strong engagement in these markets. Can you describe who this core customer is - their key characteristics, behaviors, or what makes them most likely to discover and purchase from Urban Essentials?

Turn 4:
Great profile - fashion-forward urban professional women 25-45 who value versatile, quality pieces and brand values alignment. The digital native behavior on Instagram and TikTok gives us clear channel signals for later.

To size this audience properly, do you have any data on how many women fitting this profile exist across your target markets? Or alternatively, what percentage of women 25-45 in these metros would you estimate match your core customer characteristics - the fashion-forward, digitally engaged, values-conscious segment?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Perfect. Using your 15-20% estimate with higher concentration in major metros gives us a substantial addressable audience across these markets.

Let me structure your target geography with audience sizing. I'll use DMA-level analysis for your 8 target markets:

**TARGET GEOGRAPHY ANALYSIS**

| DMA Market | Total Population | Women 25-45 | Target % | Target Audience Size |
|------------|------------------|-------------|----------|---------------------|
| New York | 7,450,000 | 1,340,000 | 25% | 335,000 |
| Los Angeles | 5,200,000 | 935,000 | 25% | 234,000 |
| Chicago | 3,470,000 | 625,000 | 20% | 125,000 |
| Miami-Ft. Lauderdale | 2,750,000 | 495,000 | 20% | 99,000 |
| Austin | 2,350,000 | 425,000 | 15% | 64,000 |
| Denver | 1,740,000 | 315,000 | 15% | 47,000 |
| Nashville | 1,900,000 | 340,000 | 15% | 51,000 |
| Portland | 1,240,000 | 225,000 | 12% | 27,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **26,100,000** | **4,700,000** | **21%** | **982,000** |

Your total addressable audience is nearly 1 million target customers across these markets. At your 25,000 acquisition target, you'd need to convert roughly 2.5% of your addressable audience - very realistic for fashion retail with strong digital targeting.

Does this geographic breakdown align with your market priorities?

Turn 6:
Excellent - your geography foundation is solid with strong addressable audience scale and realistic conversion requirements.

Now let's move to budget allocation. With your $1.2M total budget and these 8 target markets, we need to decide how to distribute spend. 

Should we weight the allocation based on market size and opportunity (larger budgets to NYC/LA), or do you prefer a more balanced approach that gives meaningful investment to test and scale the tier 2 markets? Your current presence and performance data in these markets would help guide this decision.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Smart approach - balancing proven scale with growth opportunity. Let me model a weighted allocation that gives major metros meaningful investment while ensuring tier 2 cities get sufficient budget for optimization.

**BUDGET ALLOCATION BY MARKET**

| Market Tier | Markets | Target Audience | Budget | % of Total | Per Market Avg |
|-------------|---------|-----------------|--------|------------|----------------|
| **Major Metros** | NYC, LA, Chicago, Miami | 793,000 | $660,000 | 55% | $165,000 |
| **Tier 2 Growth** | Austin, Denver, Nashville, Portland | 189,000 | $540,000 | 45% | $135,000 |
| **TOTAL** | 8 markets | 982,000 | $1,200,000 | 100% | $150,000 |

This gives major metros 55% of budget while investing meaningfully in tier 2 growth markets at 45%. Each tier 2 market gets $135K - sufficient for meaningful testing and optimization across multiple channels.

The allocation projects to:
- Major metros: $660K ÷ 13,750 target customers = $48 CAC
- Tier 2 markets: $540K ÷ 11,250 target customers = $48 CAC

Consistent efficiency targets across both tiers. Does this allocation feel right for your growth strategy?

Turn 8:
Perfect! Your budget allocation provides solid foundation for both scale and growth. Now let's define your value proposition.

You mentioned customers want pieces that work for professional and social lives, value quality and versatility, and prefer brands aligned with sustainability and inclusivity values. 

What's Urban Essentials' core brand promise that differentiates you from other fashion retailers? In other words, when your ideal customer discovers your brand, what unique value do you deliver that makes her choose you over competitors?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Excellent value proposition - "Effortless versatility for the modern woman" with the sustainability/inclusivity values alignment is compelling and differentiating.

Now let's build your channel strategy. Given your target customer's digital-native behavior on Instagram and TikTok, plus your need for both acquisition and brand building across 8 markets, we'll need a multi-channel approach.

Based on your $48 CAC target, fashion vertical, and digitally engaged audience, I'm seeing strong potential for:
- Paid social (Meta/Instagram, TikTok) for discovery and engagement
- Google Search for intent capture 
- Programmatic display for awareness and retargeting
- Possibly connected TV for brand building in key markets

Which channels have you tested before, and where have you seen your best performance to date?

Turn 10:
Perfect foundation - Instagram's strong performance and Google Search's intent capture give us proven channels to build on. TikTok's high engagement with conversion optimization upside is exactly what we want for your audience.

Given your $1.2M budget and performance data, here's a strategic channel mix:

**RECOMMENDED CHANNEL ALLOCATION**

| Channel | Budget | % | Strategy Focus |
|---------|--------|---|----------------|
| **Meta/Instagram** | $480,000 | 40% | Primary acquisition + retargeting |
| **Google Search** | $300,000 | 25% | Intent capture + branded defense |
| **TikTok** | $240,000 | 20% | Discovery + conversion optimization |
| **Connected TV** | $120,000 | 10% | Brand awareness in tier 2 markets |
| **Testing Reserve** | $60,000 | 5% | New platform/creative testing |

This prioritizes your proven performers while scaling TikTok's conversion potential and adding CTV for tier 2 awareness. The 40% Instagram allocation maintains your strongest channel while 25% Search ensures intent capture.

Does this allocation align with your channel priorities and comfort level?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Excellent! Your channel strategy balances proven performance with strategic growth opportunities.

Now let's establish measurement. With your $48 CAC target and multi-channel approach, we need metrics that capture both direct performance and cross-channel effects.

**PRIMARY MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK:**

**Core KPIs:**
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): $48 target
- New Customer Count: 25,000 target  
- LTV/CAC Ratio: 3.75x target

**Channel Performance Metrics:**
- Meta/Instagram: CPA, ROAS, engagement rate
- Google Search: CPA, conversion rate, impression share
- TikTok: CPA, view-through conversions, engagement
- Connected TV: Brand lift, assisted conversions

**Cross-Channel Tracking:**
- First-touch attribution for awareness channels
- Last-touch for direct response
- View-through conversion windows

Given Instagram's strong performance and multi-channel complexity, what attribution model are you currently using, and do you have incrementality testing capability to validate true channel impact?

Turn 12:
You're absolutely right - last-click attribution will severely undervalue your awareness investments, especially CTV and upper-funnel TikTok content.

**RECOMMENDED ATTRIBUTION STRATEGY:**

**Multi-Touch Attribution Model:**
- First-touch credit for awareness (CTV, TikTok, upper-funnel Instagram)
- Last-touch credit for intent capture (Google Search, retargeting)
- View-through windows: 1-day click, 7-day view for social; 28-day for CTV

**Budget-Friendly Incrementality Testing:**
- Geographic lift tests: Compare CTV markets vs. control markets
- Platform holdout tests: Meta's Conversion Lift (built-in, no extra cost)
- Search brand lift: Monitor branded search volume increases
- Cross-channel correlation analysis using your existing GA4 data

**Implementation Priority:**
1. Set up proper view-through tracking in GA4 (immediate)
2. Configure Meta Conversion Lift studies (month 1)
3. Design geo-holdout test for CTV launch (month 2)

This approach validates true incrementality without requiring expensive third-party measurement platforms. The geo-testing for CTV will be especially valuable for proving tier 2 market impact.

Does this measurement approach feel manageable with your current resources?

Turn 13:
Perfect! Your measurement framework will give you the data needed to optimize across channels and prove incrementality.

Now let's design your testing strategy. With $60,000 in testing reserve plus built-in platform testing, we can validate key assumptions and discover new opportunities.

**RECOMMENDED TESTING ROADMAP:**

**Quarter 1 Priority Tests:**
- TikTok conversion optimization: Creative formats vs. awareness content ($15K)
- Instagram audience expansion: Lookalikes vs. interest targeting ($10K)
- CTV creative testing: 15-second vs. 30-second spots ($10K)

**Quarter 2-3 Expansion:**
- YouTube Shorts: Leverage TikTok creative for Google ecosystem ($15K)
- Pinterest: Visual platform test for fashion discovery ($10K)

**Ongoing Platform Tests:**
- Meta: Creative fatigue rotation, audience refinement
- Google: Smart Bidding vs. manual, ad extension testing

The Q1 tests directly optimize your core channels, while Q2-3 explores adjacent opportunities. Each test has clear success metrics tied to your $48 CAC target.

What testing priorities interest you most, or are there specific assumptions you want to validate first?
