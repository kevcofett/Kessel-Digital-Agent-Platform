# Media Plan Output: Sophisticated User - IDK Protocol

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, Risks, and Economics. Each step builds on the last.

I can see you want 10,000 new users with $500K - that's $50 per acquisition. For remittance fintech, that's tight but achievable if we target precisely.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 10,000 users? For example, are you focused on transaction volume, revenue growth, or market share in specific corridors?

Turn 2:
Perfect - focusing on active transacting users rather than vanity signups is smart. That $50 acquisition cost makes much more sense when we're talking about users who actually send money.

$500K ÷ 10,000 = $50 per active user. For remittance, high-performing campaigns typically see $40-80 CAC for quality users who transact within 30 days, so your target sits right in the sweet spot.

Based on remittance benchmarks, you'll likely need to acquire 15,000-20,000 signups to get 10,000 active senders, assuming 50-65% activation rates for well-targeted campaigns.

How do you currently measure "active user"? Is it first transaction within 30 days, or do you have a specific transaction frequency threshold that defines success?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Great question - corridor-specific targeting typically delivers 15-20% higher activation rates than broad immigrant targeting. Users searching "send money to Mexico" or "Philippines remittance" show much stronger intent than general diaspora audiences.

So with your 50-65% activation assumption, we're looking at acquiring roughly 15,000-20,000 signups to hit your 10,000 activated users. That works out to $25-33 per signup, which is very achievable for remittance.

Your economics look solid. Assuming a conservative 2-3% take rate on average transaction values, activated users typically generate $15-25 in first-month revenue, creating a reasonable payback timeline.

What's your average transaction value, and do you have a sense of your take rate? This helps us validate whether $50 CAC for activated users gives you healthy unit economics.
