# Media Plan Output: Budget Revision Midstream

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by calculating your implied efficiency: $500K ÷ 10,000 = $50 per customer acquisition cost. With $2,400 LTV, that projects to a 48x LTV/CAC ratio - extremely healthy for B2B SaaS where 3-5x is typical.

Your target efficiency looks very achievable. What specific business outcome are you trying to drive with these 10,000 new customers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect! $24M ARR from 10,000 customers confirms your $2,400 LTV figure and shows strong unit economics alignment.

Your primary objective is clear: accelerate ARR growth targeting mid-market. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success. What will be your primary KPI - the specific number you'll track to know if this campaign is working?

For example, will you focus on qualified leads generated, demos booked, trials started, or customers acquired monthly?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Excellent! Your funnel math is solid: 67,000 MQLs at 15% close rate = 10,000 customers. That means your target efficiency is $500K ÷ 67,000 = $7.46 per MQL.

For B2B SaaS targeting mid-market, $7.46 per MQL is aggressive but achievable with tight targeting and strong value proposition. Typical benchmarks range $15-40 per MQL, so you'll need precise audience definition and efficient channels.

Step 1 complete - we have your objective (ARR growth), KPI (MQLs), and volume target (67,000). 

Now for economics: you mentioned 15% MQL-to-customer conversion. What's your current cost structure? Do you have target gross margins or constraints on how much you can invest upfront before seeing returns?

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using 65% gross margin, which is strong for SaaS and supports your aggressive $7.46 per MQL target. Your cash flow positive position gives good flexibility for upfront investment.

At $50 customer acquisition cost with $2,400 LTV and 65% margins, you're looking at roughly 2-month payback periods - very healthy for scaling.

Your economics foundation is solid for Step 2. The $7.46 per MQL target is ambitious but your strong unit economics support it.

Now let's define your audience. You mentioned targeting mid-market - what size companies specifically? For example, are you targeting companies with 100-500 employees, $10M-100M revenue, or different criteria?

Turn 5:
Perfect! 100-1,000 employees and $10M-$200M revenue gives us clear firmographic boundaries. VPs of Operations, CFOs, and BI heads are excellent decision-maker profiles - they have budget authority and feel the data consolidation pain directly.

To size this audience properly, I need a few more signals. What industries or verticals perform best for CloudMetrics? For example, do you see stronger adoption in manufacturing, professional services, healthcare, retail, or is it fairly industry-agnostic within that company size range?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent! Manufacturing and professional services as primary verticals with healthcare as growth opportunity gives us strong targeting focus. Higher conversion rates in manufacturing/professional services suggests we should weight budget toward those segments.

One more audience question: Are there specific technology signals that indicate good fit? For example, do your best customers typically use certain CRM platforms, have existing data warehouses, or show other tech stack patterns that help identify readiness for analytics solutions?

Turn 7:
Perfect! Salesforce/HubSpot users, existing BI tools like Tableau/Power BI, heavy Excel usage, and ERP systems (NetSuite/SAP) are excellent intent signals. These show data maturity and pain points that CloudMetrics solves.

Your audience definition is solid: 100-1,000 employees, $10M-$200M revenue, manufacturing/professional services primary with healthcare secondary, decision makers in Operations/Finance/BI roles, using existing data tools but struggling with silos.

Step 3 complete. Now for geography - are you targeting specific regions, or is this a national U.S. campaign? Any geographic concentrations where your current customers cluster?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Great! US and Canada with concentration in major metros and manufacturing hubs gives us clear geographic focus. Remote capability removes location barriers while metro concentration suggests where decision makers are most active.

Your geographic scope is well-defined for targeting efficiency.

Now for budget allocation. With $500K total budget, how are you thinking about splitting between US and Canada? Also, do you have any preference for allocating more budget toward your high-performing manufacturing and professional services segments versus spreading evenly across verticals?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Smart allocation thinking! 80/20 US-Canada aligns with market size, and 60/40 weighting toward manufacturing/professional services leverages your higher conversion rates.

Let me calculate this: $500K total budget breaks down to $400K US, $100K Canada. Within that, $300K toward manufacturing/professional services, $200K for other verticals including healthcare.

At your $7.46 per MQL target, this projects to roughly 40,200 MQLs from manufacturing/professional services and 26,800 from other segments.

This allocation makes strategic sense given your conversion data. 

Now let's develop your value proposition. When you win deals against competitors, what's the primary reason prospects choose CloudMetrics? Is it ease of implementation, better analytics capabilities, pricing, or something else?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 10:
Excellent! "Analytics in weeks, not months" is powerful positioning that directly addresses mid-market pain points. Fast implementation (2-4 weeks vs 3-6 months) and seamless data source connection without technical overhead are clear differentiators.

Your value proposition should emphasize speed-to-value and simplicity for busy mid-market operations leaders who can't afford long implementations.

Step 6 complete - we have your core value drivers defined.

Now for channels. Given your $7.46 per MQL target and mid-market B2B audience, what channels are you currently using or considering? For example, are you thinking about LinkedIn ads, Google search, industry publications, or other approaches?
