# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience with Segment-Specific Channels

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a sophisticated segmented media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Your segmentation is excellent - three distinct personas with clear behavioral differences. $5M / 50,000 = $100 per enrollment, which is aggressive but achievable for education with strong lifetime value.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve beyond the 50,000 enrollments? For example, are you optimizing for course completion rates, long-term student success, or building a sustainable acquisition engine for ongoing growth?

Turn 2:
Perfect - sustainable acquisition engine with scalable efficiency across three segments. That's the right strategic focus.

Your $100 implied CAC is ambitious for education. Let me check if this aligns with your unit economics. What's the average lifetime value (LTV) of a student across your segments, or what does a typical student pay for their full program?

This will help us assess whether $100 CAC creates a viable LTV/CAC ratio for sustainable growth.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Excellent - segment-specific efficiency targets will drive much better results than artificial blending.

Based on your input, I'm modeling:
- Career Changers: ~$150 CAC targeting $6K+ LTV (4x+ ratio)
- College-Age: ~$70 CAC with growth potential through repeat purchases
- Corporate L&D: Higher CAC justified by enterprise deal size

This approach is realistic and sustainable. Your $5M budget can support these varied efficiencies while building the data needed to optimize each segment independently.

Economics look solid. Now let's define these segments more precisely for targeting. Starting with Career Changers - beyond the demographics you mentioned (28-42, tech hubs), what behavioral or psychographic signals identify your best prospects? For example, specific job titles, career transition triggers, or research behaviors that predict enrollment?

Turn 5:
Perfect signals - job titles hitting growth ceilings, career disruption triggers, and that 2-3 month research cycle are gold for targeting and nurturing.

The research-heavy behavior suggests they need extended touchpoint sequences, not quick conversions. LinkedIn thought leader engagement and newsletter consumption gives us clear interest targeting.

Now for College-Age - beyond TikTok/Instagram and creator influence, what specific behaviors or life situations drive them to consider your programs over traditional college? Are they college dropouts, gap year students, or actively enrolled but exploring alternatives?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it. I'll model using $3,500 average LTV based on your range - you can refine anytime as you gather more segment data.

$3,500 LTV / $100 CAC = 3.5x ratio, which is healthy for sustainable growth. However, this assumes uniform efficiency across very different segments.

Let me assess feasibility: Career changers likely have higher CACs due to B2B-like research behavior, while college-age may be more efficient through social channels. Corporate L&D will definitely require higher investment given the ABM approach and longer sales cycles.

Your blended $100 target is achievable but will require segment-specific efficiency strategies. Career changers might run $150+ CAC but justify it with $6K+ LTV, while college-age could hit $60-80 CAC.

Does this efficiency variation across segments align with your business model, or do you need each segment to hit closer to that $100 target?

Turn 6:
Excellent - the common thread of cost-consciousness and demand for immediate ROI creates strong messaging hooks. That peer success story influence and salary transparency requirement will be crucial for creative strategy.

For Corporate L&D - you mentioned HR and L&D decision-makers, but who else is typically involved in the buying process? Are you selling to individual L&D managers, or do these decisions require C-suite approval, procurement involvement, or committee consensus?

Turn 7:
Perfect - multi-stakeholder committee sale with 6-9 month cycles. That confirms ABM approach and suggests we'll need content for different personas within the buying committee. The L&D manager champion strategy is spot-on.

Geography is straightforward given your segment definitions, but let me confirm one detail: For Corporate L&D's "corporate HQ cities" - are we talking Fortune 500 headquarters concentration, or broader business centers? This affects our DMA targeting precision.

Your audience definition is excellent across all three segments. Ready to move to budget allocation across these segments?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Perfect - mid-market enterprise concentration in major business centers is smart targeting.

Given your segment economics and channel realities, here's how I'd allocate the $5M:

**Career Changers: $2.5M (50%)**
- Targeting ~16,700 enrollments at $150 CAC
- Justification: Highest LTV segment, LinkedIn/podcast channels are expensive but efficient for this audience

**College-Age: $1.5M (30%)**  
- Targeting ~21,400 enrollments at $70 CAC
- Justification: Social channels offer scale efficiency, largest enrollment volume

**Corporate L&D: $1M (20%)**
- Targeting ~6,700 enrollments, but higher deal values
- Justification: ABM is expensive, longer cycles, but enterprise LTV justifies investment

This gets you to ~44,800 enrollments with $250K flexibility buffer for optimization and testing.

The allocation prioritizes your highest-value segment while leveraging social efficiency for volume. Does this split align with your business priorities, or would you weight differently?

Turn 9:
Excellent - the allocation balances value optimization with scalable volume while maintaining realistic efficiency expectations per segment.

Now let's develop value propositions that resonate with each segment's specific motivations:

**Career Changers** need messaging around career transformation and ROI validation given their extensive research behavior.

**College-Age** responds to speed, cost-efficiency, and peer success stories.

**Corporate L&D** requires business impact metrics and stakeholder consensus-building content.

Starting with Career Changers - what's your strongest proof point for career transformation? Specific salary increases, job placement rates, or success stories that overcome their "extensive research" skepticism?

Turn 10:
Powerful proof points - 40-60% salary increases with specific case studies will cut through their research skepticism. The LinkedIn recommendations create social proof in their native environment.

For College-Age - given their focus on immediate ROI and peer influence, what's your strongest counter-narrative to "you need a college degree"? Do you have data on time-to-employment, starting salaries of graduates, or specific creator/influencer success stories that resonate with this generation?

Turn 11:
Excellent - speed-to-employment (3-6 months vs 4 years), debt-free outcomes, and authentic graduate influencers create a compelling alternative education narrative.

For Corporate L&D - given the committee sale dynamic, what business impact metrics help your L&D champion build internal consensus? Employee retention improvements, productivity gains, or specific ROI calculations that get C-suite and procurement buy-in?

Turn 12:
Perfect - 25% retention improvement and concrete cost savings ($2,500 vs $15K+) with 30-day skill application gives L&D champions bulletproof business cases for committee consensus.

Your value propositions are strong across all segments. Now for channels - this is where segment-specific strategies really matter.

For Career Changers with their research-heavy behavior and LinkedIn focus, I'm thinking LinkedIn Sponsored Content for thought leadership engagement, podcast advertising on business/tech shows, and retargeting sequences that nurture their 2-3 month consideration cycle.

What's been your experience with LinkedIn performance for this segment, and are there specific podcasts or newsletter placements that have worked well?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 13:
Excellent performance data - LinkedIn + podcast + newsletter creates perfect touchpoint sequence for their research behavior.

For College-Age with their TikTok/Instagram focus and creator influence, I'm thinking TikTok ads featuring your graduate influencers, Instagram Reels showcasing quick success stories, and potentially Snapchat for broader Gen Z reach. The authentic graduate content should perform much better than traditional ads.

How scalable is your graduate influencer program, and have you tested TikTok advertising yet, or are you primarily organic on social platforms currently?

Turn 14:
Smart approach - authentic graduate content clearly outperforms polished marketing. The content volume challenge is real for social algorithms.

For Corporate L&D with that complex 6-9 month committee sale, I'm thinking LinkedIn ABM campaigns targeting multiple stakeholders, programmatic display retargeting across business publications, and potentially direct mail for high-value prospects. You'll need different content for L&D champions versus C-suite budget approvers.

Given the multi-stakeholder buying process, have you tested account-based approaches, or are you currently treating this more like individual lead generation?

Turn 15:
Exactly - individual lead gen explains the lower conversion rates. True ABM with coordinated multi-stakeholder messaging will dramatically improve those 6-9 month cycles.

Your channel strategy is taking shape:

**Career Changers:** LinkedIn + podcasts + newsletters with extended nurture sequences
**College-Age:** TikTok + Instagram with authentic graduate influencer content  
**Corporate L&D:** LinkedIn ABM + programmatic display + direct mail for committee consensus

Each approach matches segment behavior perfectly. Now for measurement - with three distinct segments and different channel mixes, how are you currently tracking attribution, and what's your primary success metric beyond enrollments?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 16:
Your attribution gaps are common with complex B2B-like journeys - first/last-touch misses the nurture reality, especially for those 2-3 month career changer cycles.

Given your multi-touchpoint segments, I'd recommend moving toward multi-touch attribution with incrementality testing. For career changers, you need to credit that initial podcast impression even if LinkedIn gets the last click. For Corporate L&D, you need to track account-level engagement across multiple stakeholders.

The engagement depth metric is smart - it predicts completion rates and true customer quality.

For testing approach across these three distinct segments - are you planning to run separate test programs for each, or unified testing with segment breakouts? Each segment's different channels and cycles suggest they need different testing methodologies.

Turn 17:
Perfect - separate testing programs match the distinct behavioral realities. Career changer nurture sequences, college-age creative optimization, and Corporate L&D ABM approaches each need different methodologies and timelines.

Your attribution insight is spot-on - podcasts and thought leadership are likely driving significant value without conversion credit.

Final area: What risks are you most concerned about with this segmented approach? Channel saturation, creative fatigue, competitive response, or operational complexity of managing three distinct strategies simultaneously?
