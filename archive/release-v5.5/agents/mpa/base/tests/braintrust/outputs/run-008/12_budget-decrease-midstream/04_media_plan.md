# Media Plan Output: Budget Decrease Midstream

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Your objective is clear - 500 qualified opportunities from enterprise prospects. Let me confirm your primary success metric: Are you measuring success by Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) that meet your ICP criteria, or Sales Qualified Opportunities that have been vetted by your sales team?

Turn 2:
Perfect - Sales Qualified Opportunities is the right metric for enterprise B2B. Your sales team's validation ensures we're measuring real pipeline impact.

Let me run the efficiency math: $1M ÷ 500 SQLs = $2,000 per SQL. 

For enterprise data infrastructure with $150K average deal size, this is aggressive but achievable. Industry benchmarks typically show $1,500-$3,500 per SQL for this vertical, so you're targeting the efficient end of the range.

To validate this efficiency, I need to understand your sales conversion: What percentage of your SQLs typically convert to closed deals, and what's your average sales cycle length?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent conversion rate - 25-30% SQL-to-close is strong for enterprise infrastructure. Your math checks out: 500 SQLs × 25-30% × $150K = $18.75-22.5M pipeline value.

$2,000 per SQL becomes very attractive when each SQL has $37.5-45K expected value ($150K × 25-30%). That's a 19-23x return on ad spend, which validates your efficiency target as realistic.

The 6-9 month sales cycle means SQLs generated in Q1 may close in Q3-Q4, so we'll need leading indicators for campaign optimization rather than waiting for closed deals.

Your economics look solid. Step 1 complete - you need 500 Sales Qualified Opportunities as your primary KPI with $2,000 target efficiency. Ready to move to audience definition?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Perfect - scaling pain at the 10TB to 100TB+ inflection point is a precise trigger. Analytics teams waiting on slow data refreshes and exploding cloud costs create urgent business impact that justifies six-figure investments.

This gives us strong behavioral signals: companies experiencing rapid data growth, increased cloud spend, and performance degradation. These signals will help us identify prospects actively feeling the pain versus those still comfortable with current solutions.

Now for company firmographics: Beyond the 5000+ employees, are there specific industries where this scaling pain hits most acutely? For example, do you see more traction in fintech, e-commerce, SaaS companies, or is it fairly distributed across verticals?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 4:
Strong ICP definition - VP/Director level data and IT leaders with budget authority at 5000+ employee companies. These are the right decision makers for $150K infrastructure investments.

To build precise targeting, I need to understand the pain points that drive these leaders to evaluate new data infrastructure. What specific business challenges or technical problems typically trigger them to start looking for solutions like yours? 

For example: are they dealing with data pipeline failures, scaling bottlenecks, compliance requirements, or cost optimization pressures?

Turn 6:
Excellent - fintech, e-commerce, SaaS, media, and adtech are perfect verticals with inherent data volume growth that creates your scaling pain points.

These industries also have strong budget authority at the VP/Director level and understand the ROI of infrastructure investments. Transaction processing, real-time fraud detection, and attribution modeling are mission-critical use cases that justify premium solutions.

For geographic focus: Are you primarily targeting North American enterprises, or do you have global reach? And within your target regions, are there specific metro areas or tech hubs where these data-heavy companies concentrate?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Perfect geographic focus - US, UK, and Germany with clear metro concentration. The tech hub strategy makes sense given your target verticals cluster in these areas.

Your audience definition is now complete:

**ICP:** 5000+ employee companies in fintech, e-commerce, SaaS, media, and adtech
**Decision Makers:** VP/Director level in IT and Data (CDOs, VPs of Engineering, Directors of Data Engineering)
**Pain Point:** Scaling infrastructure failing at 10TB to 100TB+ with slow processing and exploding cloud costs
**Geography:** US (SF, Seattle, NYC, Austin), UK (London), Germany (Berlin, Munich)

This gives us roughly 2,000-3,000 target companies across these markets and verticals - a focused but sufficient universe for your 500 SQL target.

Ready to move to budget allocation across these three geographic markets?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
Your geographic allocation is strategically sound: US 70% ($700K), UK 20% ($200K), Germany 10% ($100K).

This translates to efficiency targets of:
- US: $700K ÷ 350 SQLs = $2,000 per SQL  
- UK: $200K ÷ 100 SQLs = $2,000 per SQL
- Germany: $100K ÷ 50 SQLs = $2,000 per SQL

The allocation reflects market maturity well. US enterprise marketing typically shows $1,800-2,500 per SQL for your vertical. UK costs run 10-20% higher due to smaller market, so $2,000 is efficient. Germany can be volatile in early stages but $2,000 gives room for learning.

One consideration: Germany's 50 SQL target with limited market presence might make optimization challenging. We may want to concentrate German spend in shorter, focused flights rather than spreading thin across the year.

Ready to develop your value proposition messaging framework?

Turn 9:
Perfect - concentrated Q2 and Q4 German flights will generate cleaner performance data and stronger market impact.

For your value proposition, we need messaging that directly addresses the scaling pain points we identified. Based on your ICP analysis, I see three core value pillars emerging:

1. **Performance at Scale** - solving the 10TB to 100TB+ bottleneck
2. **Cost Optimization** - reducing exploding cloud compute spend  
3. **Analytics Velocity** - eliminating day-long data refresh delays

Before we develop specific messaging, what's your primary competitive differentiation? When prospects evaluate you against alternatives, what typically wins the deal - is it performance benchmarks, cost savings, ease of implementation, or something else?
