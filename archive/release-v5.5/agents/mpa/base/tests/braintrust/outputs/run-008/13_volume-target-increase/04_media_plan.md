# Media Plan Output: Volume Target Increase

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

I can see you want to acquire 5,000 new customers - that's a clear volume target. Before we dive into the economics, what's the primary business outcome you're trying to achieve with these new customers? For example, are you focused on immediate revenue growth, market share expansion, or building long-term customer value?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Revenue growth through customer acquisition is your primary objective. Now let's check if your targets are realistic.

$400K ÷ 5,000 customers = $80 per customer acquisition cost (CAC)

With your $320 LTV, that creates a 4:1 LTV/CAC ratio, which is excellent for sustainable growth. Based on home goods benchmarks, $80 CAC is achievable but will require focused execution - typical range is $60-$120 depending on product mix and channels.

Your efficiency target looks solid. What's your average order value for new customers? This helps me assess if we need immediate payback or if you can invest for longer-term returns.

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Excellent! $135 AOV with $320 LTV over 6 months gives you solid flexibility. At $80 CAC, you're achieving 1.7x immediate ROAS ($135/$80), which is healthy for first purchase, and your repeat purchase pattern makes the economics very attractive.

Step 1 is complete - revenue growth through 5,000 new customers. Step 2 economics look strong with realistic efficiency targets.

Now for Step 3 - let's define your target audience. Who is your ideal customer for home goods? I'm looking for demographics, behaviors, and any signals that identify your best buyers versus casual browsers.

Turn 4:
Great audience definition! Let me capture the key signals:

**Demographics:** Homeowners, 30-55, middle to upper-middle class, primarily women
**Behavioral:** Active renovators/redecorators, follow home design content, seek unique pieces vs mass market
**Value-driven:** Quality and style conscious, willing to pay premium, multi-purchase behavior

This audience has strong targeting signals for digital channels. Now I need to understand the geographic scope.

Are you planning to target nationally across the US, or do you have specific regions or metro areas you want to focus on? Any geographic restrictions due to shipping costs or performance differences you've noticed?

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 5:
Perfect! National targeting with $400K budget gives you good reach across suburban and metropolitan areas where your audience concentrates.

Step 4 complete - national US targeting with focus on suburban/metro areas where homeowners have larger spaces.

Now for Step 5 - budget allocation. With your $400K total budget and national scope, how are you thinking about splitting this? For example, do you want to allocate a portion for testing new markets, reserve budget for peak performance periods, or distribute evenly across Q1-Q2?

Also, is this $400K purely for media spend, or does it need to cover creative production and other costs?

Turn 6:
Smart approach! Spring home project seasonality is real - Q2 typically sees 15-20% higher conversion rates for home goods based on industry data.

I'd recommend: **Q1: $175K, Q2: $175K, Testing Reserve: $50K**

This gives you equal quarterly firepower while keeping that $50K flexible for doubling down on what works or testing new opportunities. You can shift some Q1 budget to Q2 if early performance confirms the seasonal lift.

The testing reserve is crucial at your $80 CAC target - it allows you to validate new audiences or channels without risking core performance.

Now for Step 6 - your value proposition. What makes HomeStyle Direct different from competitors? What message resonates most with those home design enthusiasts when they're deciding where to buy their unique pieces?

Turn 7:
Excellent positioning! "Transform your space with pieces as unique as you are" is compelling differentiation against mass market sameness. The curation angle and cohesive styling service adds real value beyond just product.

Step 6 complete with strong value proposition focused on uniqueness, quality, and personalized styling.

Now for Step 7 - channels. Given your audience (homeowners 30-55, design-focused, quality-conscious) and $350K active budget, I'm seeing strong potential for Meta/Instagram (visual products, design content affinity), Google (search intent for home décor), and possibly Pinterest (home inspiration hub).

What channels are you currently using, and are there any you definitely want to include or avoid in this plan?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
Perfect channel selection! Meta, Pinterest, and Google Shopping are ideal for your visual products and design-focused audience. Smart to avoid display given your past performance data.

Let me model the allocation based on your $350K active budget:

**Google Shopping: $140K (40%)** - Captures high-intent search for unique home pieces
**Meta/Instagram: $140K (40%)** - Visual storytelling, lookalikes from current customers  
**Pinterest: $70K (20%)** - Home inspiration hub, longer consideration cycle

This balances immediate intent capture (Google) with audience development (Meta) and inspiration-driven discovery (Pinterest). The 40/40/20 split allows meaningful optimization in each channel.

Does this allocation align with your thinking, or would you adjust the percentages based on your current performance data?
