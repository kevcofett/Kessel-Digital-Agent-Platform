# Media Plan Output: Geography Expansion Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

I can see you want to drive 500,000 store visits and online conversions combined - that's a solid volume target. To make sure we're aligned on success, what's the primary business outcome you're trying to achieve? For example, are you focused on revenue growth, market share expansion, or brand awareness in new segments?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Revenue growth with market share expansion is a clear business objective. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success as a number.

$2.5M budget targeting 500,000 visits/conversions = $5 per action. But since your goal is revenue growth, what's your primary success metric? Are you tracking total revenue generated, revenue per customer, or something else? And what's your target number - for example, "$10M in attributed revenue" or "25% revenue increase"?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 4:
Perfect audience definition! You've identified high-value signals: $60K+ income, specific fitness activities, omnichannel shopping behavior, and social engagement patterns. This creates a precise but scalable target.

**Audience Quality Check:**
Your combination of income level + specific activities + research behavior suggests quality over quantity - these customers likely have higher lifetime value and conversion rates than broad "fitness interested" audiences.

The Instagram/Strava engagement is particularly valuable for lookalike modeling if you have customer data from those platforms.

One key question: Do you have first-party customer data (email lists, purchase history, website visitors) that we can use for lookalike audiences? First-party lookalikes typically outperform interest-based targeting by 40-60% and would be crucial for hitting your ambitious 4.8x ROAS target.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Excellent! Your economics look solid. Let me show you the math:

**Target Performance:**
- $12M revenue / $2.5M spend = 4.8x ROAS
- 500,000 actions at $180 AOV = $90M potential (if all convert)
- $2.5M / 500,000 = $5 per action

Your 4.8x target ROAS is achievable for athletic apparel, especially with your $180 AOV providing good unit economics. The $5 cost per action is efficient for driving both online conversions and store visits.

Based on industry benchmarks, athletic apparel typically sees 3-5x ROAS, so your 4.8x target is ambitious but realistic with tight execution.

Now let's define your audience precisely. You mentioned active adults 25-45 who are fitness enthusiasts. Beyond age, what other characteristics define your ideal customer? For example, income level, specific fitness activities, shopping behaviors, or lifestyle signals?

Turn 5:
Excellent! 150,000 email subscribers is a strong foundation for lookalike modeling. Customer purchase data will be especially powerful for creating high-converting audiences.

**Data Asset Quality:**
Your first-party data should drive significant performance advantages. Lookalike audiences from purchase data typically achieve 20-30% better conversion rates than interest-based targeting, which supports your aggressive 4.8x ROAS target.

Now for geography. You mentioned US market - do you want to target all 50 states equally, or are there specific regions, DMAs, or markets you want to prioritize? For example, do you see stronger performance in certain climates, urban vs suburban areas, or regions where your retail partners have stronger presence?

Turn 6:
Smart geographic approach! Top 25 DMAs capture ~54% of US population while focusing spend where your retail partnerships are strongest.

**Geographic Strategy Validation:**
Prioritizing warm-weather markets (CA, TX, FL) plus fitness-conscious metros (Denver, Seattle, Northeast) aligns perfectly with your active lifestyle targeting. This geographic focus should improve efficiency versus broad national targeting.

Let me create your DMA framework once we move to Step 4. The retail partner presence factor is crucial - co-location of digital reach and physical stores typically improves attribution and conversion rates.

Now for budget allocation. You have $2.5M total. How do you want to think about budget distribution? For example, do you want to allocate by geography based on market size, split between acquisition and retention, or divide between driving online sales versus store visits? What's your initial thinking on budget priorities?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Excellent framework! Your allocation strategy shows strong strategic thinking:

**Budget Allocation Math:**
- $2.5M × 60% acquisition = $1.5M for new customers
- $2.5M × 40% retention = $1M for existing customers  
- 50/50 online vs. store visits across both buckets

**Strategic Assessment:**
Your 60/40 acquisition/retention split is smart for a growth-focused brand. The equal online/store split leverages your omnichannel strength and higher LTV customers.

Weighting toward warm-weather + fitness-conscious markets should improve efficiency significantly - these markets typically show 15-25% better conversion rates for athletic apparel.

This allocation should support your 4.8x ROAS target by focusing spend where conversion probability is highest while maintaining growth through acquisition.

Now let's define your value proposition. With quality-focused customers willing to invest in performance gear, what makes ActiveWear Pro different from competitors like Nike, Lululemon, or Under Armour? What's your unique positioning in the market?

Turn 8:
Perfect positioning! "Premium performance at accessible price points" is a compelling value proposition that differentiates you clearly in the market.

**Value Proposition Strength:**
Your "smart choice" positioning targets the gap between mass market and luxury - a sweet spot for your $60K+ income, research-driven customers. The versatility angle (gym-to-street) addresses a real lifestyle need for busy professionals.

This messaging should resonate strongly in your priority markets where people balance active lifestyles with professional demands.

**Strategic Advantage:**
Quality-conscious customers who research before purchasing will appreciate your technical fabric story combined with accessible pricing. This positions you well against both premium brands (better value) and mass market (better performance).

Now we're ready for channels. Based on your audience (Instagram/Strava active, research-driven, omnichannel), your objectives (60% acquisition, 50/50 online/store), and $2.5M budget - what channels are you currently considering or have had success with in the past?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Excellent channel foundation! Your current mix aligns perfectly with your audience behavior and research-driven purchase path.

**Current Channel Assessment:**
- Meta (FB/IG): Strong for fitness enthusiasts, video showcases, lookalike targeting from your 150K database
- Google Search: Captures research behavior, essential for omnichannel attribution
- YouTube influencer: Builds credibility with fitness community

**Strategic Channel Expansion:**
Based on your $2.5M budget and 4.8x ROAS target, I'd recommend:

1. **Connected TV** - Reaches your demo during sports/fitness programming, builds brand awareness to support lower-funnel performance
2. **Google Shopping** - Critical for product research behavior, drives both online and store visits  
3. **Programmatic Display** - Retargeting your website visitors and lookalike expansion
4. **Strava/fitness app partnerships** - High-intent audience alignment

**Budget Allocation Recommendation:**
- Meta: 35% ($875K) - Core acquisition + retention
- Google (Search + Shopping): 25% ($625K) - Capture research intent
- CTV: 20% ($500K) - Brand building + awareness
- YouTube: 10% ($250K) - Influencer + video ads
- Programmatic: 10% ($250K) - Retargeting + expansion

This mix balances proven performance with strategic expansion while maintaining your ROAS target. Does this channel strategy align with your thinking?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 10:
Great questions! Let me address both:

**Programmatic at $250K:**
Actually quite impactful for retargeting. Your website traffic should generate substantial retargeting pools, and $250K allows for:
- Website visitor retargeting: ~$150K
- Lookalike expansion: ~$100K

With retargeting typically achieving 2-3x higher conversion rates, this budget should drive strong incremental performance while keeping CPMs reasonable.

**YouTube Strategy Mix:**
I'd recommend splitting the $250K:
- $150K influencer partnerships (60%) - Builds credibility and authentic product demonstrations
- $100K direct video ads (40%) - Scale reach on fitness/lifestyle content with your own creative

This combination lets you leverage influencer authenticity while maintaining creative control for broader reach.

**Performance Validation:**
At these allocations, you should see clear incrementality. The key is measuring how CTV and influencer work support your Meta and Google performance - expect to see 10-15% lift in lower-funnel conversion rates with proper upper-funnel investment.

Now for measurement - with your omnichannel objectives and 4.8x ROAS target, how are you currently tracking attribution across online and in-store conversions?
