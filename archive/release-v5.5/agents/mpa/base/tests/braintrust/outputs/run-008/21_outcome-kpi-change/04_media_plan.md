# Media Plan Output: Outcome KPI Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start - you've given me strong foundation data. Let me quickly model your efficiency:

$5M / 25,000 = $200 per acquisition

With $2,800 LTV, that's a 14x LTV/CAC ratio - excellent efficiency that gives us substantial room for optimization and testing.

Your business outcome is clear: 25,000 new policy acquisitions. How do you define success beyond volume? Are you tracking policy retention rates, premium values, or specific customer quality metrics as primary KPIs?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Excellent - quality metrics that protect your LTV assumptions. 85% retention at 12 months is strong, and the $1,200+ premium threshold makes perfect sense for sustainable unit economics.

So we have:
- **Primary Objective:** 25,000 new policy acquisitions  
- **Primary KPI:** Volume (25,000 policies)
- **Quality Gates:** 85%+ 12-month retention, $1,200+ average premium
- **Efficiency Target:** $200 CAC (very achievable with your 14x ratio)

This gives us excellent foundation for Step 2. Your $200 CAC target is conservative compared to insurance benchmarks I typically see at $250-400, which means we can prioritize quality over pure volume efficiency.

One economics question: Is that $2,800 LTV based on customers who meet your quality thresholds (85% retention, $1,200+ premium), or is it a blended average? This affects how we balance volume versus quality in our targeting approach.

Turn 3:
Perfect - this changes our efficiency picture significantly:

**Quality-focused scenario:** $5M / 25,000 = $200 CAC against $3,500-4,000 LTV = 17.5-20x ratio

That's exceptionally strong efficiency that justifies premium targeting and channels. Your economics are solid and realistic.

Now let's move to Step 3: Audience. You've outlined homeowners 35-65, $100K+ income, with life event triggers. Let me dig deeper into the targeting precision.

For the life event triggers - buying a home, having a baby, approaching retirement - these happen at different frequencies and have different consideration windows. New homebuyers might need insurance immediately, while pre-retirees plan months ahead.

Which of these three life events represents your highest-converting audience segment, and should we weight our targeting toward that group?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Excellent prioritization based on conversion data. Your 60/25/15 allocation makes strategic sense - lead with high-converting new homebuyers while capturing the high-LTV pre-retiree segment.

This gives us a sophisticated audience framework:
- **Primary:** New homebuyers (60% weight, 8-12% conversion, 30-45 day window)
- **Secondary:** Pre-retirees (25% weight, 3-4% conversion, longer cycle, highest LTV)  
- **Tertiary:** New parents (15% weight, 3-4% conversion)

All within homeowners 35-65, $100K+ income targeting quality customers above $1,200 premium threshold.

The tight homebuyer window means we'll need channels with immediate reach and retargeting capabilities. Pre-retirees suggest longer nurture sequences.

Now for Step 4: Geography. Are you targeting nationally, or do you have geographic constraints based on where TrustGuard is licensed to write policies?

Turn 5:
Smart approach - leading with your proven markets while maintaining national expansion. Let me model this geographically with DMA-level precision.

**Core Southeast/Midwest Markets (40% allocation):** $2M budget
- Strong suburban presence, favorable competition
- Target markets: Atlanta, Charlotte, Nashville, Dallas, Indianapolis, Columbus, Kansas City, St. Louis
- Projected performance: $175-190 CAC (better than national average)

**National Expansion (60% allocation):** $3M budget  
- Higher competition markets like California, New York, plus growth opportunities
- Projected performance: $205-220 CAC (still well within your efficiency targets)

**Blended projection:** $2M + $3M targeting 25,000 acquisitions = $200 average CAC

This geographic split balances proven performance with scale opportunities. Your 14x+ LTV ratio gives us buffer even in competitive markets.

Should we map this to specific DMA targets, or does this directional 40/60 split work for moving to Step 5: Budget allocation?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Perfect - your economics and geography foundation is solid. Now for Step 5: Budget allocation.

Before we dive into channel distribution (that's Step 7), let's first allocate your $5M budget across the strategic dimensions we've established:

**By Audience Segments:**
- New homebuyers (60%): $3M
- Pre-retirees (25%): $1.25M  
- New parents (15%): $750K

**By Geography:**
- Core Southeast/Midwest (40%): $2M
- National expansion (60%): $3M

These create a matrix for optimization. Your new homebuyer budget gets the lion's share, but we're preserving meaningful investment in high-LTV pre-retirees.

One key budget question: Do you have separate budgets for acquisition versus retention/nurture campaigns, or is this $5M purely for new customer acquisition? The reason I ask is your pre-retiree segment with longer sales cycles might benefit from dedicated nurture budget.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Perfect value proposition alignment with audience motivations and buying behaviors. You've nailed the psychological triggers:

**Value Propositions by Segment:**
- **New homebuyers:** Speed/convenience ("Get covered in minutes") - urgency-driven
- **Pre-retirees:** Premium protection ("Protect what you've built") - quality-focused  
- **New parents:** Family value ("Complete protection your family can afford") - value-conscious

These distinct value props will drive creative strategy and channel selection in Step 7.

Your messaging hierarchy makes strategic sense - new homebuyers won't comparison shop extensively due to time pressure, pre-retiires will research thoroughly and pay for quality, new parents need cost justification.

Ready for Step 7: Channels? This is where we'll map your audience segments, geographic strategy, and value propositions to the optimal media mix. Given your life event targeting and nurture requirements, I'm already seeing some clear channel priorities, but I want to hear your current thinking first.

What channels have worked best for TrustGuard historically, and are there any you're particularly interested in testing?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 7:
Excellent thinking - that 70/30 acquisition-to-nurture split recognizes the reality of your conversion cycles. Let me model this:

**Budget Structure:**
- **Acquisition (70%):** $3.5M for initial prospect capture
- **Nurture/Retargeting (30%):** $1.5M for conversion optimization

**Nurture allocation by segment:**
- New homebuyers: $450K (shorter cycle, immediate retargeting)
- Pre-retirees: $375K (extended nurture sequences you mentioned)
- New parents: $225K (moderate nurture needs)

This gives your pre-retiree segment meaningful nurture investment while maintaining acquisition momentum across all segments.

Now for Step 6: Value Proposition. Given your three distinct audience segments with different motivations and timelines, you'll need tailored messaging. 

What's your core value proposition for new homebuyers versus pre-retirees? Do you lead with price, coverage, service, or something else for each segment?

Turn 9:
Excellent channel foundation - your Google Search performance at $180-200 CAC is strong, and the Facebook/radio success with pre-retirees shows good audience understanding.

Based on your segments and performance data, here's my recommended channel allocation:

**Tier 1 Channels (65% - $3.25M):**
- **Google Search (40% - $2M):** Your proven performer, especially for new homebuyers with immediate intent
- **Facebook/Meta (25% - $1.25M):** Pre-retiree nurture sequences and lookalike expansion

**Tier 2 Channels (25% - $1.25M):**
- **Connected TV (15% - $750K):** Perfect for pre-retiree trust-building and brand awareness
- **LinkedIn (10% - $500K):** High-income professional targeting across all segments

**Tier 3 Test Channels (10% - $500K):**
- **Local Radio (5% - $250K):** Expand your proven Southeast pre-retiree success
- **YouTube (5% - $250K):** Educational content for pre-retirees, immediate retargeting for homebuyers

This prioritizes your proven channels while testing CTV and LinkedIn as you wanted. The allocation heavily weights search for homebuyer volume while giving meaningful budget to longer-cycle pre-retiree channels.

Does this channel mix align with your testing priorities?
