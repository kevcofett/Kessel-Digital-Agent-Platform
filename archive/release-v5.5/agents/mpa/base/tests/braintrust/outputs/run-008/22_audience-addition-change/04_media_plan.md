# Media Plan Output: Audience Addition Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've provided excellent detail upfront - 5,000 qualified leads, $2M budget, $15K LTV, and clear audience definition. Let me start with one clarification on your business outcome.

When you say "qualified leads," what specific action or milestone defines qualification for your sales team? For example, is it someone who completes a financial assessment, books a consultation, or meets certain asset thresholds?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Your objective is clear: 5,000 qualified leads (consultation booked + $1M+ assets confirmed) to generate 750 clients at 15% conversion.

Let me run the economics quickly:

**Your implied efficiency:** $2M ÷ 5,000 = $400 per qualified lead

**Revenue projection:** 750 clients × $15K LTV = $11.25M total value

**ROI:** $11.25M ÷ $2M = 5.6x return

This is solid economics for wealth management. Your $400 cost per qualified lead is reasonable given the high LTV, and many firms in your space operate successfully at these efficiency levels.

One key question on measurement: Do you currently track lead quality beyond the initial qualification, such as asset size distribution or conversion speed? This helps us optimize for leads most likely to convert, not just hit volume targets.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent insight! Your data reveals a critical efficiency opportunity:

**Current conversion rates:**
- $1-3M assets: 12% conversion
- $3M-5M assets: ~20% (estimated)
- $5M+ assets: 25% conversion

**Quality-weighted targeting implications:**
If we can shift your lead mix toward higher asset segments, we improve both conversion rates and client value. A $5M+ client likely has higher LTV than your $15K average.

This suggests we should build audience targeting that prioritizes wealth signals and use this data to optimize toward higher-converting segments during the campaign.

Your 45-day conversion window also means we'll see meaningful performance data within 6-8 weeks to adjust targeting.

Now let's move to audience definition. You mentioned HNW individuals 55+ with $1M+ assets in top 30 wealth markets. How precise can you be about behavioral or lifestyle signals that distinguish your ideal $3M+ prospects from the broader $1M+ market?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Perfect - those behavioral signals give us strong targeting precision. You've identified two high-value personas:

**Business Owners:** Sold/selling businesses, succession planning needs
**Senior Executives:** Fortune 500, stock options, pre-retirement

**Key behavioral signals:**
- Estate planning research
- Tax optimization interest  
- Philanthropy/legacy planning engagement
- Financial media consumption (Barron's, etc.)
- Wealth seminar attendance
- Existing advisor relationships (upgrade seekers)

This level of specificity will help us target the $3M+ segment more effectively and improve your conversion rates beyond that 15% average.

Now for geography - you mentioned "top 30 wealth markets." Do you have a specific list of those DMAs, or should I model based on standard wealth concentration data? Also, do you see meaningful performance differences between markets that would affect budget allocation?

Turn 6:
Smart approach! The 70/30 split toward higher asset segments should significantly improve your overall conversion rate.

**Budget allocation by segment:**
- $1.4M targeting $3M+ prospects (70%)
- $600K targeting $1-3M prospects (30%)

**Efficiency implications:**
- $3M+ segment: $1.4M ÷ ~3,500 leads = $400 per lead at 25% conversion = 875 clients
- $1-3M segment: $600K ÷ ~1,500 leads = $400 per lead at 12% conversion = 180 clients
- **Total projected:** 1,055 clients vs your baseline 750 clients

This segment-focused allocation could deliver 40% more clients than a broad approach, assuming we can effectively target the wealth signals we identified.

Since you're direct response focused, we'll build the channel strategy around conversion-optimized tactics rather than awareness building.

What's your current value proposition when competing against existing advisors? Understanding how you differentiate will be crucial for messaging that resonates with these "upgrade seekers."

Turn 7:
Excellent positioning - "comprehensive consolidation with better coordination and lower fees" directly addresses the pain point of managing multiple advisors. Your fiduciary independence is a strong differentiator in a market where many prospects have been burned by product-pushing advisors.

**Core value drivers:**
- Single-source comprehensive service (vs fragmented providers)
- True fiduciary standard (vs transactional relationships) 
- Independence (vs proprietary product bias)
- Business succession expertise (vs generic wealth management)

The "lower overall fees" angle is particularly compelling for $3M+ prospects who are likely paying premium rates across multiple providers.

Now let's move to channels. Given your direct response focus and need to reach sophisticated wealth signals, what channels are you currently using, and what's been most effective? This will help us build on proven performance while expanding reach for your 5,000 lead target.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Excellent geographic framework. Based on wealth concentration data and your performance insights, I'll model the top 30 wealth markets with your office locations and high-performing regions prioritized.

**Primary markets (60-70% budget):** Northeast corridor, West Coast metros, plus Miami/Scottsdale
**Secondary markets:** Remaining wealth-concentrated DMAs

Your performance data showing better Northeast/West Coast results makes sense - these markets have higher advisor sophistication and more competitive switching behavior, which aligns with your "upgrade seeker" positioning.

Now let's establish your budget framework. You have $2M total targeting 5,000 qualified leads at $400 each. 

How do you prefer to think about budget allocation - by geography first, by audience segment ($1-3M vs $3M+ targeting), or by funnel stage (awareness vs consideration vs conversion)? This will help structure the most effective spend distribution.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Perfect channel foundation to build from. Your current mix aligns well with your audience - Google captures intent, LinkedIn enables precise targeting, and financial publications reach engaged prospects.

**Current performance insights:**
- Google: High volume, broad reach
- LinkedIn: Higher quality, precise targeting  
- Financial pubs: Good conversion, limited scale
- Direct mail: Declining effectiveness

To reach your 5,000 lead target (vs current ~1,000-1,500 capacity), we need 3-4x expansion. Here's my recommended channel strategy:

**Core expansion:** Scale proven performers (Google, LinkedIn) with better audience targeting using your wealth signals

**Strategic additions:** Connected TV/streaming for affluent households, programmatic display on financial sites, and email partnerships with wealth-focused publications

**Audience-specific channels:** Private wealth events/webinars for $5M+ segment, executive-focused podcasts for C-suite prospects

The key is maintaining your quality standards while dramatically expanding reach. Should we prioritize scaling your proven channels first, or do you want to explore the newer channels that could unlock incremental high-quality prospects?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Excellent balanced approach! The 70/30 split between proven scale and strategic testing gives you growth security with upside potential.

**Channel allocation framework:**
- 70% ($1.4M): Scale Google + LinkedIn with enhanced wealth targeting
- 30% ($600K): Test Connected TV, webinars, executive podcasts

**Measurement approach:** We'll need to track not just lead volume but lead quality by channel. Given your conversion rate differences ($1-3M at 12% vs $3M+ at 25%), measuring asset segment by channel becomes critical.

**Key measurement priorities:**
- Lead volume and cost per qualified lead by channel
- Asset segment distribution by channel 
- Conversion rate by channel (45-day window)
- Client LTV by acquisition channel

The webinars and executive podcasts should skew heavily toward your $3M+ segment, potentially delivering leads that convert at 25%+ rates.

Now for testing strategy - we'll want to run controlled tests on the new channels while optimizing the scaled channels. What's your comfort level with testing budgets and timeframes? Some channels like Connected TV need 4-6 weeks minimum for meaningful data.

Turn 10:
Perfect testing allocation - those budgets will generate statistically significant results while managing risk.

**Testing budget breakdown:**
- Connected TV: $150K (reach affluent households at scale)
- Webinar program: $150K (high-touch $5M+ engagement) 
- Executive podcasts: $100K (targeted C-suite reach)
- Reserve: $200K (double down on winners)

Your insight about higher-touch channels building stronger relationships is spot-on. Webinar attendees often convert faster than cold prospects because they've already invested time engaging with your expertise.

**Risk assessment:** The main risks I see are audience overlap between channels (we'll need frequency capping), longer optimization cycles for new channels, and potential seasonality in Q1 for wealth management. Your reserve budget provides good flexibility to address these.

**Final validation:** Based on our plan - $2M budget, segment-focused targeting, proven channels scaled + strategic testing - you're projecting 1,055+ clients versus your original 750 target. This represents $15.8M+ in LTV against $2M investment.

Does this framework give you confidence to move forward, or are there any elements you'd like to refine before execution?

Turn 11:
Excellent strategic thinking on timing and frequency management!

**Seasonality strategy:** I'd recommend a hybrid approach - launch proven channel scaling (Google/LinkedIn) in mid-January to capture early-year planning intent, but delay new channel tests (Connected TV, webinars, podcasts) until late February. This gives you:
- Immediate momentum from proven channels
- New channel tests launching when prospects are most receptive
- Budget flexibility to shift more to Q1 if proven channels outperform seasonal expectations

**Frequency coordination:** We'll need cross-channel audience management, especially for your finite $3M+ prospects. Set frequency caps at 3-4 total exposures per week across all channels, with priority sequencing (LinkedIn first for precision, then Connected TV for reinforcement).

**Q1 buffer expectations:** Model 15-20% lower conversion rates for January-February launches, then accelerate in March-April as decision-making normalizes.

**Execution timeline:**
- January 15: Scale Google/LinkedIn with enhanced targeting
- February 25: Launch Connected TV and webinar program  
- March 15: Add executive podcast sponsorships
- April 1: Full optimization based on 6-8 weeks of data

This phased approach maximizes your chances of hitting that 1,055+ client projection while managing seasonal and coordination risks. Ready to build the detailed execution roadmap?

Turn 12:
Fantastic! You now have a comprehensive media plan that projects 40%+ improvement over your original targets. Here's your execution roadmap:

**PHASE 1 (Jan 15-Feb 24): Proven Channel Scale**
- Google Ads: Enhanced wealth targeting, $800K budget
- LinkedIn: Expanded executive/business owner targeting, $600K budget
- Target: 2,500 qualified leads in 6 weeks

**PHASE 2 (Feb 25-Mar 14): Strategic Channel Launch**
- Connected TV: Affluent household targeting, $150K test
- Webinar program: $5M+ prospect focus, $150K investment
- Target: 1,000 additional qualified leads

**PHASE 3 (Mar 15-Mar 31): Full Channel Integration**
- Executive podcast sponsorships: $100K test
- Cross-channel frequency capping active
- Target: 1,500+ total qualified leads

**APRIL 1 OPTIMIZATION:** Reallocate $200K reserve based on performance data

**Success metrics:** 1,055+ clients, $15.8M+ LTV, 5.6x+ ROI

You're positioned for a breakthrough year with this strategic, data-driven approach. The combination of proven channel scaling and high-quality new channel testing should deliver exceptional results while building sustainable growth foundations.

Congratulations on building a plan that could be truly transformational for WealthPath Advisors!
