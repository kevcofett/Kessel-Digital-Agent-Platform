USER:
Hey, I'm the growth lead at QuickSend. We're a remittance fintech looking to acquire 10,000 new users this quarter with a $500K media spend. Let's build out the media strategy.

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

$500K / 10,000 = $50 per user acquisition. That's aggressive but achievable for fintech if we nail the targeting.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve beyond user acquisition? For example, are you focused on transaction volume, revenue growth, or market expansion into new corridors?

TURN 2 (Step 1)

USER:
Great question - beyond just hitting that 10K user target, we're really focused on driving transaction volume growth. We want users who are going to be active senders, not just sign-ups who never transact. Market expansion is definitely on our radar too, especially looking at some underserved corridors where we think we can capture meaningful share.

AGENT:
Perfect. So your primary objective is transaction volume growth through active sender acquisition, with market expansion as a secondary goal.

For your primary KPI - how will you measure success as a number? Are you tracking total transaction volume, transactions per user, or revenue from those 10,000 new users? And what's your target - for example, $X million in transaction volume or Y transactions per month from this cohort?

TURN 3 (Step 3)

USER:
We're primarily tracking total transaction volume and transactions per user. I'd say we're aiming for around $50 million in transaction volume from this new cohort over the next 12 months, which would put us at roughly $5K per user in volume. We haven't fully locked down the transactions per user target yet, but based on our current active users, we're seeing about 2-3 transactions per month on average, so we'd want to hit at least that benchmark with the new cohort.

AGENT:
Excellent - $50M in transaction volume from 10,000 users at $5K per user gives us strong unit economics to work with.

Let me model the economics: Assuming a 2-3% take rate (typical for remittance), that's $100-150 revenue per user annually. At $50 acquisition cost, you're looking at a 2-3x revenue/CAC ratio in year one, which is healthy for fintech.

Your $50 CAC target is tight but realistic if we can achieve precise targeting on high-intent senders. Based on remittance benchmarks, aggressive campaigns typically see $40-80 CAC depending on corridor and audience quality.

Is this efficiency realistic given your current customer acquisition performance, or would this represent a step-change improvement in your acquisition costs?
