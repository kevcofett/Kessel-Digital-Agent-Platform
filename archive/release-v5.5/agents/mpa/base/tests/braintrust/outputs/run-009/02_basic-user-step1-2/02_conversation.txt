USER:
Hi! I'm looking to get more people to buy shoes from our online store. Can you help me figure out the best way to do that?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve? For example, are you looking to get a certain number of new customers, hit a sales target, or grow your overall shoe business by a specific amount?

TURN 2 (Step 1)

USER:
We want to increase our overall sales and get more new customers buying our shoes online. I'd say we're hoping to grow our business by maybe 30-40% this year if that's realistic. We haven't set exact numbers yet, but we definitely want to see more people discovering our brand and making purchases.

AGENT:
That's a solid growth target! To build the right plan, I need to understand what success looks like in concrete numbers.

When you say grow the business by 30-40%, what does that mean for you - is that 30-40% more in total sales dollars, or 30-40% more new customers buying shoes? And roughly what size is your business now so I can understand the scale we're working with?

TURN 3 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I think we're looking at both really - more sales dollars and more new customers. Right now we do maybe around $800,000 in online sales annually, so we'd want to get that up to over a million. I'm not exactly sure how many customers that translates to, but I'd guess we want to bring in a few hundred new customers each month to hit those numbers.

AGENT:
Perfect! So you're aiming to grow from $800K to over $1M in annual sales - let's call that $1.2M as our target, which is a 50% increase. That's ambitious but achievable.

If you're bringing in a few hundred new customers monthly, that's roughly 2,000-3,000 new customers for the year. Let me ask this: what does a typical customer spend when they first buy shoes from you? For example, do most people buy one pair for $80, or do they often buy multiple pairs or higher-end shoes for $150+?

This helps me figure out if your customer numbers and sales target align properly.

TURN 4 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Most people usually buy one pair when they first shop with us, and our shoes are typically priced between $60 to $120. I'd say the average first purchase is probably around $80 to $90. Some customers do come back and buy more pairs later, but for new customers it's usually just one pair to start with.

AGENT:
Great! Let me check the math here. At $85 average first purchase, you'd need about 4,700 new customers to generate $400K in new sales ($1.2M - $800K = $400K growth).

$400K ÷ $85 = approximately 4,700 new customers

That's about 390 new customers per month, which matches your "few hundred monthly" estimate perfectly.

Now here's the key question: how much can you afford to spend to win each new customer? For example, if it costs you $40 in ads to get someone to buy an $85 pair of shoes, does that work for your business after accounting for the cost of the shoes and shipping?
