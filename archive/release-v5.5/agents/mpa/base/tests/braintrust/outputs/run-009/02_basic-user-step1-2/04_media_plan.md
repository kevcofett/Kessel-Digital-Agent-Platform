# Media Plan Output: Basic User - Steps 1-2 Completion

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve? For example, are you looking to get a certain number of new customers, hit a sales target, or grow your overall shoe business by a specific amount?

Turn 2:
That's a solid growth target! To build the right plan, I need to understand what success looks like in concrete numbers.

When you say grow the business by 30-40%, what does that mean for you - is that 30-40% more in total sales dollars, or 30-40% more new customers buying shoes? And roughly what size is your business now so I can understand the scale we're working with?

Turn 3:
Perfect! So you're aiming to grow from $800K to over $1M in annual sales - let's call that $1.2M as our target, which is a 50% increase. That's ambitious but achievable.

If you're bringing in a few hundred new customers monthly, that's roughly 2,000-3,000 new customers for the year. Let me ask this: what does a typical customer spend when they first buy shoes from you? For example, do most people buy one pair for $80, or do they often buy multiple pairs or higher-end shoes for $150+?

This helps me figure out if your customer numbers and sales target align properly.

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 4:
Great! Let me check the math here. At $85 average first purchase, you'd need about 4,700 new customers to generate $400K in new sales ($1.2M - $800K = $400K growth).

$400K ÷ $85 = approximately 4,700 new customers

That's about 390 new customers per month, which matches your "few hundred monthly" estimate perfectly.

Now here's the key question: how much can you afford to spend to win each new customer? For example, if it costs you $40 in ads to get someone to buy an $85 pair of shoes, does that work for your business after accounting for the cost of the shoes and shipping?
