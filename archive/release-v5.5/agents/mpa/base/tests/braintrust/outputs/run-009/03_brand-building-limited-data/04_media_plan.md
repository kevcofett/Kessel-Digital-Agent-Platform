# Media Plan Output: Brand Building with Limited Data

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect setup - natural supplements on the West Coast with a solid $500K budget. For your brand awareness objective, what specific business outcome are you trying to achieve? For example, are you looking to drive a certain number of new customers, reach a revenue target, or establish market presence before a bigger push?

Turn 3:
Perfect! Let's model at 3,500 new customers - right in your target range. 

$500K ÷ 3,500 = approximately $143 per customer acquisition cost. 

For the supplement industry, that's a healthy efficiency target. Now I need to check if this makes business sense - what's the typical value of a new customer to GreenLeaf? For example, does an average customer spend $80 on their first order, or do they typically purchase $150+ over their first few months?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Got it - establishing market presence with initial sales momentum. To build a realistic plan, I need to define success as a number we can measure. 

Since you're new to the West Coast, what would feel like a strong foundation? For example, would acquiring 2,500 new customers feel like solid momentum, or are you thinking bigger like 5,000 customers? This helps me figure out if your $500K budget can achieve your goals efficiently.

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using $200 customer lifetime value based on your estimate - that's conservative given your $60-80 first orders plus $100-150 repeat purchases. You can refine this anytime.

At $143 cost per customer with $200 LTV, that projects to a 1.4x LTV/CAC ratio. That's tight for profitability - most supplement brands need 2-3x to be sustainable long-term.

This suggests two paths: either we need to be more efficient at customer acquisition, or your actual customer value is higher than estimated. Since you're prioritizing market presence over immediate profitability, this could work for a foundation-building campaign. 

Does this efficiency assessment make sense for your launch strategy?

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Perfect, that's a smart foundation-building approach. Your $143 per customer is achievable for market entry, and you're right that actual customer value often exceeds initial estimates once subscription patterns emerge.

Now let's define who we're targeting. You mentioned health-conscious people - help me get more specific about your ideal West Coast customer. Are we talking about wellness enthusiasts who already buy supplements regularly, or people just getting into natural health? Any particular age ranges or lifestyle signals that make someone perfect for GreenLeaf?

Turn 6:
Excellent targeting - millennials and Gen Z who are wellness-curious but not supplement-saturated. That's a growing segment on the West Coast.

Let me get more specific on the behavioral signals. Beyond shopping at Whole Foods and following wellness influencers, what other activities or interests would identify your ideal customer? For example, do they tend to buy organic food, use fitness apps, practice meditation, shop at certain retailers, or engage with specific types of content online?

Turn 7:
Perfect - that paints a clear picture of wellness-integrated millennials and Gen Z who prioritize natural choices within busy lifestyles.

Now for geography. You mentioned California, Oregon, and Washington. Do you want to focus on the major metro areas where this audience concentrates - like LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland - or are you thinking broader coverage across these three states? The metro areas will have higher concentrations of your target audience but also higher media costs.

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Smart choice - concentrating on LA, San Francisco, Seattle, and Portland maximizes your efficiency with this audience. Those metros have the highest concentration of wellness-integrated millennials and Gen Z.

Your $500K budget focused on four major metros projects to strong reach within your target demographic. Now let's talk budget allocation. How are you thinking about splitting this $500K? Are you leaning toward equal investment across all four cities, or do you want to weight certain markets more heavily based on size or opportunity?

Turn 9:
Based on market size and your target demographic concentration, I'd recommend this allocation:

**LA: 40% = $200K** (largest market, huge millennial/Gen Z wellness population)
**San Francisco: 30% = $150K** (high income, strong wellness culture, premium pricing tolerance)
**Seattle: 20% = $100K** (growing wellness scene, tech-savvy millennials)
**Portland: 10% = $50K** (smaller but highly engaged wellness community)

This weights toward the larger markets while ensuring meaningful investment in each city. LA gets the biggest share due to sheer size, SF gets premium allocation due to high customer value potential.

Does this split align with your market priorities, or would you adjust any of these allocations?

Turn 10:
Perfect! That allocation gives you strong market presence where it matters most while maintaining focus.

Now let's define what makes GreenLeaf compelling to these wellness-integrated millennials and Gen Z customers. When someone in LA or SF is deciding between supplement brands, what's your key advantage? Is it ingredient quality, specific health benefits, ease of use for busy lifestyles, sustainability story, or something else that sets you apart from other natural wellness brands?

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 11:
Excellent positioning - "approachable wellness without the overwhelm" is perfect for your target audience. That simplicity message will resonate strongly with busy millennials and Gen Z who want results without complexity.

Now let's build your channel strategy. Based on your audience - wellness-curious millennials and Gen Z who follow influencers, use apps, and shop organic - I'd recommend this media mix:

**Social Media (50% = $250K)**: Instagram and TikTok for wellness content, influencer partnerships
**Digital Video (25% = $125K)**: YouTube wellness channels, streaming platforms  
**Search (15% = $75K)**: Google ads for supplement and wellness searches
**Audio (10% = $50K)**: Spotify/podcast ads during wellness and lifestyle content

This prioritizes the visual, social platforms where your audience discovers wellness brands. Does this channel mix align with where you think your customers spend their time?
