# Media Plan Output: High-Stakes Performance Campaign

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start - you've given me strong foundational data. Let me quickly validate the economics: $2M ÷ 50,000 = $40 per merchant acquisition. With $850 LTV, that's a 21x LTV/CAC ratio, which is exceptionally strong efficiency for fintech.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 50,000 new merchants? For example, are you focused on total payment volume, revenue growth, market share expansion, or geographic penetration?

Turn 3:
Perfect! 50,000 merchants as your primary KPI with $15-20M ARR upside - that's a clear success framework.

Now let's assess if your efficiency target is achievable. Your $40 CAC is extremely favorable for fintech - industry benchmarks typically show $150-400 CAC for quality merchants. This suggests either very strong product-market fit or potential for scaling beyond 50,000 merchants with the same budget.

One key question: Is the $850 LTV based on actual cohort data from your existing merchants, or is it modeled? The answer affects how confidently we can plan around that 21x ratio, especially when scaling this aggressively.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Excellent - revenue growth and market share expansion with fast scaling gives us clear direction. Your $40 CAC against $850 LTV creates tremendous room for aggressive acquisition.

To complete our outcomes foundation, I need to understand how you'll measure success as a number. What's your primary KPI for this campaign? 

For example, is it the 50,000 merchant count itself, a specific ARR dollar target from those merchants, or total payment volume processed? This helps ensure we optimize toward what matters most for your business.

Turn 5:
Strong profile - that $10K-100K monthly transaction range is a sweet spot with clear pain points around rates and features. The multi-vertical approach (retail, restaurants, professional services, e-commerce) gives us good scale potential.

Let me dig deeper on one critical aspect: Within that transaction range, do you see meaningful differences in conversion rates, LTV, or acquisition costs between the lower end ($10K-25K monthly) versus higher end ($50K-100K monthly) merchants? 

This affects whether we should target the full range equally or weight our approach toward the more valuable segment, especially given your aggressive 50,000 target.

Turn 6:
Excellent insight - that LTV spread from $650 to $1,400 creates significant strategic choices. The higher-value merchants justify higher CAC, while the lower end offers faster conversion velocity.

Given your $40 blended CAC target and 50,000 merchant goal, let's think about optimal mix. If we weighted toward higher-value merchants (say 40% in the $50K-100K range), we could potentially afford $60-80 CAC for them while staying under $40 blended, assuming the lower segments come in around $20-30 CAC.

What's your current conversion rate difference between these segments? For example, does the $10K-25K segment convert at 8% while the $50K-100K segment converts at 3%? This helps determine realistic acquisition volume by segment.

Turn 7:
Perfect - that conversion rate insight confirms the strategic opportunity. Higher CAC for high-value merchants with longer sales cycles, faster conversion for volume at the lower end.

I'll model using your directional rates and we can refine as we go. Based on your feedback, a weighted approach targeting roughly 40% high-value, 40% mid-range, and 20% lower-value merchants could optimize both volume and LTV while staying within your $40 blended CAC.

Now for audience precision: Beyond transaction volume, what other signals help you identify these merchants? For example, do you target by business age, employee count, current payment processor, specific software they use, or other behavioral indicators that predict conversion likelihood?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Excellent - 18 months of cohort data gives us solid ground to work with, and potential upside if you're conservative on LTV makes this even more attractive.

Your $40 target CAC is highly achievable. Based on fintech benchmarks, you're targeting roughly 75% below typical merchant acquisition costs, which suggests strong product-market fit and efficient channels ahead.

Given your aggressive 50,000 merchant target and geographic expansion goals, we're looking at a performance-driven campaign requiring precise audience definition and channel efficiency. The economics support scaling, but execution will determine success.

Ready to move to Step 3 and define your target merchant profile? Understanding exactly who these 50,000 merchants are will shape everything from geography to channels.

Turn 8:
Excellent signals - dissatisfaction with current processors and software sophistication are strong conversion predictors. The 2-3 year business age and 5-50 employee range gives us clear targeting parameters.

Your software integration insight is particularly valuable - QuickBooks, Shopify, Toast users demonstrate operational maturity and likely frustration with basic payment solutions. This creates highly targetable audiences across channels.

One final audience question: Do you see geographic patterns in your best merchants? For example, do certain metro areas, regions, or even neighborhood types (downtown business districts, suburban retail strips, etc.) convert better or have higher LTV? This will help us prioritize markets for your geographic expansion beyond major metros.

Turn 9:
Perfect geographic insights - secondary metros with strong business ecosystems and organic referral potential gives us clear expansion targets. The neighborhood-level detail about business districts versus strip malls will be crucial for channel selection and creative messaging.

Your audience definition is now solid: established businesses (2-3 years), 5-50 employees, $10K-100K monthly transactions, using sophisticated software (QuickBooks/Shopify/Toast), likely frustrated with current processors, concentrated in growing secondary metros and business districts.

Ready for Step 4 - Geography? We'll map your current strongholds (Austin, Denver, Nashville) against expansion targets (Phoenix, Tampa, Charlotte) and size the opportunity in each market. This will determine how to allocate your $2M budget geographically for maximum impact.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 10:
Smart strategic thinking - that tension between defending strongholds versus expansion is critical with your aggressive 50,000 merchant target.

Before I can recommend the optimal split, I need to size these markets. Do you have data on addressable merchant counts in your key markets? For example, how many businesses in Austin/Denver/Nashville fit your profile (2-3 years old, 5-50 employees, $10K-100K monthly transactions) versus the same count in Phoenix/Tampa/Charlotte?

If you don't have exact counts, I can model using business census data and your profile criteria. This will show us whether expansion markets actually offer bigger opportunity pools or if your current strongholds still have significant untapped potential.

Turn 11:
Got it. I'll model using business census data for establishments matching your criteria (2-3 years old, 5-50 employees, target verticals) across these markets. You can refine once your team gets more precise data.

Based on typical secondary metro patterns, I estimate:

**Current Strongholds:** Austin (~8,500), Denver (~11,200), Nashville (~7,800) = ~27,500 total addressable
**Expansion Markets:** Phoenix (~14,600), Tampa (~9,400), Charlotte (~8,200) = ~32,200 total addressable

This suggests expansion markets do offer larger pools, but your strongholds still have significant runway if you're only capturing a small percentage currently.

What's your current market penetration in Austin/Denver/Nashville? Even rough estimates help determine if defending makes sense or if expansion offers better efficiency.

Turn 12:
Excellent analysis - at 3-5% penetration, your strongholds still have massive runway while expansion markets offer fresh territory. The 55% expansion, 45% defense split makes strategic sense given the market sizing.

That allocation would be roughly $1.1M for expansion (Phoenix/Tampa/Charlotte) and $900K for defense (Austin/Denver/Nashville). At your $40 blended CAC, that projects to ~27,500 merchants from expansion markets and ~22,500 from strongholds.

One critical consideration: Your proven conversion rates and referral networks in strongholds likely mean lower CAC there, while expansion markets may require higher initial investment for market entry. This could affect the actual merchant split even with equal budget allocation.

Ready to move to Step 5 - Budget? We'll structure your $2M across these geographic priorities and merchant value segments, then build your value proposition framework for each market type.

Turn 13:
Exactly right - efficiency differences will shift those merchant counts significantly. Your revised 30,000 stronghold / 20,000 expansion projection makes more sense, suggesting maybe $30 CAC in strongholds versus $55 CAC in expansion markets.

For your $2M budget structure, I recommend a phased approach for expansion markets rather than full throttle from day one:

**Strongholds ($900K):** Steady deployment leveraging proven channels and referral momentum

**Expansion ($1.1M):** 
- Phase 1 (Months 1-3): $200K testing and market entry across all three markets
- Phase 2 (Months 4-8): $600K scaled deployment in best-performing markets  
- Phase 3 (Months 9-12): $300K optimization and geographic fill-in

This approach reduces risk while building local presence and referral networks before major investment.

What's your timeline for the 50,000 merchants? Are you looking to hit that by end of year, or do you have quarterly milestones that affect how aggressively we should front-load the budget?

Turn 14:
Smart thinking - front-loading stronghold spend leverages your proven conversion rates to hit those aggressive Q1 targets. 70% in first six months gives you roughly $630K for strongholds early, which should deliver ~21,000 merchants at your lower CACs, putting you well on track for that 15,000 Q1 milestone.

This creates a nice rhythm:
- **Q1:** Stronghold acceleration + expansion testing = ~15,000 merchants
- **Q2:** Scale winning expansion markets + continued stronghold momentum = ~30,000 total
- **Q3-Q4:** Full deployment across all channels and markets = 50,000 finish

Now let's build your value proposition framework. Given the different market dynamics - established presence in strongholds versus market entry in expansion - do you use different messaging approaches? For example, do you lean on local success stories and referrals in Austin/Denver versus broader industry pain points in Phoenix/Charlotte?

Turn 15:
Excellent value proposition strategy - leveraging local social proof in strongholds while building credibility through expertise in expansion markets. The thought leadership and event sponsorship approach for expansion is smart for establishing trust before direct acquisition.

Your framework is solid:
**Strongholds:** Local success stories, merchant testimonials, referral incentives
**Expansion:** Industry pain points, national case studies, thought leadership, local business events

This different messaging approach will definitely impact channel selection and creative requirements. Strongholds can use more direct response tactics, while expansion markets need more brand-building and credibility establishment upfront.

Ready for Step 7 - Channels? We'll map the optimal media mix for each market type, balancing your proven stronghold channels against the broader awareness and credibility-building channels needed for expansion. This is where your phased approach and value proposition differences really shape the tactical execution.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 16:
Excellent channel foundation - LinkedIn and Google capture your core intent and targeting needs perfectly. Programmatic B2B adds good reach across business environments.

For optimal mix given your market strategies:

**Strongholds (70% direct response):**
- LinkedIn: 40% - leverage referral targeting and lookalikes from existing merchants
- Google Search: 30% - capture high-intent "switch payment processor" searches
- Programmatic B2B: 20% - retargeting and local business site placement
- Referral/Local: 10% - merchant incentive programs

**Expansion (50% awareness, 50% direct response):**
- Industry Publications: 25% - credibility and thought leadership placement
- LinkedIn: 25% - cold prospecting with educational content
- Google Search: 20% - branded and competitor comparison terms
- Programmatic Display: 20% - broad business owner targeting for awareness
- Local Events/Sponsorships: 10% - market entry and relationship building

The key difference: expansion markets need that awareness layer to establish credibility before direct response becomes efficient. Does this channel weighting align with your experience, or would you adjust the ratios?
