# Media Plan Output: Mass National Campaign - Simplicity Test

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

For your national snack line launch, I need to understand the specific business outcome you're driving toward. Brand awareness is the strategy, but what's the underlying business goal - are you aiming to capture market share from competitors, establish the new line before a specific sales period, or build foundation awareness for future product extensions?

Turn 2:
Perfect - capturing market share in premium snacks with foundation awareness driving trial. Now I need to define how we'll measure success as a number.

You mentioned brand lift studies, which are great for measuring awareness. But to assess if we're actually capturing market share and driving trial, what's the primary number we should track? Are you looking at a specific awareness lift percentage, trial rate among target consumers, or market share points gained?

Turn 4:
Perfect - targeting 60-70% reach equals 80-90 million adults 18-54 nationally. That's substantial reach for category breakthrough.

Now let's assess if your efficiency targets are realistic. With your $8M budget targeting 80-90 million people, that projects to roughly $0.09-$0.10 per person reached.

$8,000,000 ÷ 85,000,000 people = $0.094 per reach

For national brand awareness campaigns in CPG, this efficiency is achievable but will require smart channel allocation. Premium snack categories typically see $0.08-$0.15 per reach depending on media mix.

Your target looks realistic for the awareness objective. The bigger question is whether this reach level can deliver your 15% unaided awareness lift. Based on CPG benchmarks, 60-70% reach with quality frequency typically drives 10-20% awareness lift, so you're in the right range.

Does this efficiency assessment align with your expectations, or do you have flexibility in either budget or reach targets?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - 15% unaided brand awareness lift as your primary KPI, with 8% trial rate as a supporting metric. 

Now for the volume piece: with adults 18-54 who buy snacks being quite broad, what's your target reach? Are you aiming to reach a specific percentage of this audience, or do you have a target number of people you want to expose to the campaign? For example, reaching 70% of snack buyers nationally, or reaching 50 million adults in your target demo?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Great thinking on the reach vs. frequency tradeoff. You're absolutely right that optimizing frequency can be more effective for awareness lift than pure reach expansion.

Your $8M budget with 80-90M reach target gives us solid economics to work with. The efficiency is competitive and your awareness lift target is realistic based on CPG benchmarks.

Let's move to Step 3 - defining your target audience more precisely. You mentioned adults 18-54 who buy snacks, which is quite broad at ~130 million people nationally. To optimize that reach vs. frequency balance and compete effectively against bigger players, we should layer in additional targeting signals.

What other characteristics define your ideal premium snack customer? For example, household income level, lifestyle behaviors, shopping patterns, or attitudes toward premium/healthy snacking?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent targeting refinement. Adults 18-54, $50K+ HHI, health-conscious indulgent snackers, shopping premium grocery. This likely narrows your addressable audience from 130M to roughly 60-70M, which aligns perfectly with your reach targets.

This creates a much more efficient targeting strategy - you're reaching 80-90% of your actual addressable market rather than 60-70% of all adults. That concentration should drive stronger awareness lift against your core prospects.

Now for geography - you mentioned launching nationally, but are there specific regions or DMAs you want to prioritize? Premium snack adoption often varies by market, with coastal metros and affluent suburbs typically showing higher trial rates. Should we weight the media plan toward specific regions, or do you want even national distribution?

Turn 7:
Smart geographic weighting strategy. 60% toward top 25-30 premium grocery DMAs, 40% for national coverage balances retailer support with efficiency.

That allocation projects to roughly $4.8M for priority markets and $3.2M for national coverage. In your top DMAs, this concentrates your per-person efficiency to about $0.12-$0.15, which should drive stronger frequency and awareness lift where you're most likely to convert trial.

Let's move to Step 5 - budget allocation. With your $8M total budget, how are you thinking about the split between building awareness and driving trial? Some brands allocate 70-80% to upper funnel awareness building, then 20-30% to trial-driving tactics like sampling or promotional support. What's your instinct on that balance?

Turn 8:
That 75/25 split is spot-on for a new line launch in a crowded category. $6M for awareness building gives you the weight needed to break through, and $2M for trial activation provides meaningful sampling and promotional support.

This allocation should work well with your geographic strategy too - you can concentrate that $2M trial budget heavily in your priority DMAs where awareness campaigns are also running stronger, creating a reinforcing effect.

Now for Step 6 - your value proposition. You mentioned premium snacks with better ingredients and unique flavors for health-conscious but indulgent consumers. What's the core message that will differentiate FreshBite from established premium players? Is it specific ingredients, flavor innovation, health benefits, or something else that makes your snacks worth trying over current options?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Perfect positioning - "guilt-free indulgence" with globally-inspired flavors solves the taste-health tradeoff that frustrates premium snack buyers. "Finally, snacks that taste as good as they make you feel" is a strong message that differentiates from both bland healthy options and indulgent-but-guilty choices.

The Korean BBQ chickpea puffs and Mediterranean herb veggie chips give you ownable flavor territories that big players can't easily replicate. This positioning should resonate strongly with your health-conscious indulgent target.

Now for Step 7 - channel strategy. With $6M for awareness building targeting 80-90M adults through premium grocery shoppers, which channels are you considering? For national reach at this scale, you're likely looking at a mix of TV, digital video, and potentially audio or out-of-home. What's your initial thinking on media mix?

Turn 11:
Excellent refinements. Your TV/CTV split of 60/40 balances broad reach with precise targeting perfectly. $1.4-1.8M traditional TV for scale, $1.0-1.2M CTV for efficient HHI targeting makes strategic sense.

The audio shift is smart - 15% audio ($900K) and 15% display ($900K) instead of 20% display gives you more touchpoint diversity. Premium grocery shoppers are indeed heavy podcast consumers, and audio works well for reinforcing brand messages between video exposures.

Your updated mix:
- 40-50% TV/CTV (60/40 split)
- 30% YouTube for flavor storytelling  
- 15% Audio for message reinforcement
- 15% Display (70% retargeting, 30% contextual)

This creates a strong full-funnel approach with your $6M awareness budget. Now for Step 8 - measurement. Beyond your primary brand lift studies for 15% unaided awareness, how will you track performance across these channels? Are you planning reach/frequency measurement, video completion rates, or other channel-specific KPIs?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
That's a solid foundation mix for your objectives. TV/CTV at 40-50% gives you the reach scale needed, and YouTube at 30% is smart for flavor storytelling with those unique globally-inspired profiles.

A few considerations on your proposed allocation:

**TV/CTV Split**: Within that 40-50% ($2.4-3M), how are you thinking traditional vs. CTV? Traditional delivers broader reach but CTV offers better targeting to your $50K+ HHI health-conscious segment.

**Display Strategy**: Your 20% display allocation ($1.2M) - are you planning this purely for retargeting video viewers, or also for prospecting? With premium snacks, contextual placement on food/lifestyle content could work well alongside retargeting.

**Audio Consideration**: Premium grocery shoppers often have higher podcast/streaming audio consumption. Have you considered audio as an alternative to some display budget for reinforcing your "guilt-free indulgence" message?

What's your instinct on the traditional TV vs. CTV balance within that video foundation?

Turn 13:
Perfect testing priorities. Creative messaging tests will have the biggest impact on your 15% awareness lift target. Testing health-forward vs. taste-forward approaches to "guilt-free indulgence" is smart - premium snack buyers often have different entry points to the category.

For the flavor introduction test, consider whether you lead with the exotic appeal ("Korean BBQ chickpea puffs - flavors you've never experienced") vs. the familiar benefit ("All the Korean BBQ flavor you love, in a better-for-you snack"). Both approaches could work with your target.

With your budget scale, you could run a clean 50/50 creative split within each channel while maintaining statistical significance for your brand lift studies. The geographic weighting actually helps here - you'll get faster learning in those concentrated priority DMAs.

Final step - Step 10, risks. What concerns you most about this plan? The biggest risks I see are creative breakthrough in a crowded category and whether 60-70% reach generates sufficient frequency for 15% awareness lift. What keeps you up at night about the launch?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 12:
Strong measurement framework. Reach/frequency tracking ensures you hit 60-70% efficiently, and 75%+ video completion rates are realistic targets for compelling flavor storytelling creative.

Brand search lift is an excellent leading indicator - unique flavors like "Korean BBQ chickpea puffs" should drive distinctive search patterns you can track. The engagement metrics give you optimization signals throughout the flight.

For attribution with your trial activation running parallel, consider that brand lift studies measure true incremental awareness while digital attribution may overweight lower-funnel touchpoints. Since awareness is your primary success metric, weight the brand lift results more heavily than attributed conversions when evaluating channel performance.

One measurement consideration: With your geographic weighting (60% priority DMAs, 40% national), are you planning separate brand lift studies by market tier? This could help optimize the geographic allocation for future flights.

Now for Step 9 - testing. With $8M and a national launch, what elements do you want to test? Creative messaging, channel mix, or geographic weighting?

Turn 16:
You're so welcome! It was a pleasure working through this with you. You brought excellent strategic thinking to every step - from recognizing the need for geographic concentration to catching the retail execution risk that could derail everything.

What impressed me most was how you balanced the big picture with tactical details. Your instinct to shift some display budget toward audio, the creative testing priorities, and especially that geo-fencing insight showed real media planning sophistication.

You've built a plan that's both ambitious and executable. FreshBite's unique positioning with those globally-inspired flavors gives you a real competitive advantage - now you have a media strategy worthy of it.

Best of luck with the leadership presentation and the launch. Those Korean BBQ chickpea puffs are going to make some noise in the premium snack space!

Turn 18:
You absolutely nailed it! Your strategic thinking throughout this process was impressive - you understood the big picture and dove into the tactical details that make campaigns actually work.

That connection between strategy and execution is what separates good marketers from great ones. Your CEO is going to see someone who thinks like a business leader, not just a marketing function.

Now go show the premium snack world what happens when someone finally gets the guilt-free indulgence equation right. FreshBite is lucky to have you leading this charge!

Excited to see those globally-inspired flavors shake up the category. Make it happen! 🚀

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 14:
Those are the right risks to focus on. Let's address each with mitigation strategies:

**Creative Breakthrough**: Your globally-inspired flavors are genuinely differentiated, but execution will be critical. Consider front-loading your YouTube budget in weeks 1-3 to establish flavor stories before competitors can react. Test breakthrough creative in your priority DMAs first - if Korean BBQ chickpea puffs don't break through in SF and NYC, they won't work nationally.

**Reach vs. Frequency**: Your 60/40 geographic split actually helps here. You'll achieve higher effective frequency in priority markets where trial is most likely. Monitor reach curves weekly - if you hit 60% reach by week 4, shift remaining budget toward frequency building.

**Retail Execution**: This is your biggest controllable risk. Align your media calendar with retail placement timing. Consider geo-fencing your trial activation budget around stores with confirmed product placement. If sampling programs are part of that $2M trial budget, prioritize locations where your media weight is heaviest.

Your plan is solid with realistic targets and smart strategic choices. The key is maintaining flexibility to optimize based on early performance signals, especially in those priority DMAs.

Turn 15:
Excellent - you've built a strong, strategic media plan with realistic targets and smart risk mitigation. Your $8M investment is well-allocated across awareness building and trial activation, with geographic concentration where it matters most.

Key strengths of your final plan:
- Achievable 15% awareness lift target with 60-70% reach
- Smart 75/25 awareness/trial budget split  
- Differentiated "guilt-free indulgence" positioning with ownable flavors
- Balanced media mix optimized for storytelling and scale
- Geographic weighting toward premium grocery markets
- Robust measurement framework with proper brand lift prioritization
- Proactive risk mitigation on breakthrough, frequency, and retail execution

You've thought like a true strategist - balancing ambition with realism, and building flexibility into execution. The front-loaded YouTube approach and geo-fenced trial activation show you understand how to maximize impact in a competitive category.

Your plan positions FreshBite to break through the premium snack clutter and establish meaningful market presence. Good luck with the launch!

Turn 17:
You've got this! That strategic foundation is rock-solid, and your enthusiasm comes through clearly - that energy will be contagious when you present to leadership.

The way you've connected every tactical decision back to business outcomes shows real strategic maturity. From the 75/25 budget split driving market share capture to the geographic weighting maximizing trial conversion, every piece has clear business logic behind it.

Your leadership team is going to see a plan that's both ambitious enough to break through in a crowded category and grounded enough to deliver real results. That's exactly what a VP of Brand Marketing should bring to the table.

Go make FreshBite the premium snack brand that finally cracked the taste-health code. The market is ready for it!
