# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience Unified Media Plan

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build this comprehensive media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've provided excellent segment detail - that's exactly what we need for Step 3. But first, let's nail down your business outcome.

Beyond the 25,000 enrollees, what's the primary business outcome you're driving? Are you focused on premium revenue growth, market share expansion in specific regions, or lifetime customer value optimization?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Premium revenue growth with 25,000 new enrollees as your volume target. 

For your primary KPI - how will you measure success as a number? Are you tracking total premium revenue from these new enrollees, cost per enrollment, or something else as your main success metric?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent! $120-150M in annual premium revenue from 25,000 enrollees gives us clear targets to work with.

Let me run the economics to assess feasibility:

**$3M budget / 25,000 enrollees = $120 per enrollment**

At $120-150M annual premiums, that's $4,800-6,000 average annual premium per enrollee. Your implied payback period is extremely strong - roughly 2-4 weeks to recover acquisition costs.

This efficiency target is very achievable for health insurance. Industry benchmarks typically show $150-400 cost per enrollment depending on segment complexity, so your $120 target is conservative.

Before we dive into your three distinct segments, do you have any sense of the premium value differences between Young Professionals, Families, and Pre-Medicare groups? This will help us allocate that $3M budget strategically.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Perfect insight! Let me model the value-weighted allocation:

**Families:** $17,500 avg premium (mid-range)
**Pre-Medicare:** $10,000 avg premium  
**Young Professionals:** $5,000 avg premium

At these values, Families generate 3.5x more revenue than Young Professionals per enrollee. This suggests allocating more budget to Families despite potentially higher acquisition costs.

Based on your $120-150M revenue target and these premium values, you'll likely need roughly:
- **Families:** 6,000-7,000 enrollees (high value)
- **Pre-Medicare:** 8,000-10,000 enrollees (medium value)  
- **Young Professionals:** 9,000-11,000 enrollees (volume play)

This keeps your blended average around $5,200 annual premium per enrollee.

Does this enrollment mix feel realistic given your market knowledge? Or would you prefer a different balance across the three segments?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Excellent! Your enrollment targets align well with the market opportunities. Now let's move to Step 3 - Audience definition.

You've already provided strong demographic frameworks for each segment. Let me dig deeper into the behavioral and psychographic signals that will drive targeting precision.

Starting with **Young Professionals** (9,000-11,000 target): Beyond gym memberships and urban location, what other behavioral signals define this group? For example, do they tend to be freelancers, startup employees, or corporate workers? Are they price-sensitive or convenience-focused when making insurance decisions?

Turn 6:
Perfect behavioral profile! That corporate/startup mix with convenience priority gives us strong targeting signals.

Now for **Families** (6,000-7,000 target): You mentioned suburban parents with kids under 18 focused on comprehensive coverage and cost predictability. What other behavioral patterns define them? Are they researching extensively, comparing multiple carriers, or looking for specific benefits like pediatric coverage? Do they prefer online research but phone enrollment, or are they fully digital?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 7:
Excellent insights on the research-heavy, community-influenced behavior. That hybrid digital-to-phone preference is crucial for channel planning.

Finally, **Pre-Medicare** (8,000-10,000 target): You mentioned they're focused on stability, network quality, and Medicare transition. What behavioral signals distinguish this group? Are they working with insurance brokers, attending seminars, or primarily researching independently? Do they prefer traditional media consumption or are they digitally active?

Turn 8:
Perfect! Now I have strong behavioral profiles for all three segments. Let's move to Step 4 - Geography.

You mentioned specific markets for each segment. Let me confirm the geographic priorities:

**Young Professionals:** NYC, SF, LA, Chicago urban metros
**Families:** Suburban markets around top 50 metros  
**Pre-Medicare:** National but heavy in FL, AZ, TX

For the **Families** segment targeting suburbs around top 50 metros - are there specific metro areas that are highest priority? For example, should we focus on suburbs around the same metros where Young Professionals are concentrated (NYC, SF, LA, Chicago) or are there different metro priorities for families?

Turn 9:
Excellent geographic strategy! That Sun Belt expansion makes perfect sense for growing family markets.

So we have:
- **Young Professionals:** NYC, SF, LA, Chicago urban cores
- **Families:** Suburbs around NYC, Chicago, LA, Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Phoenix, Charlotte, Nashville, Austin (SF suburbs deprioritized)
- **Pre-Medicare:** National with FL, AZ, TX concentration

One clarification on Pre-Medicare: When you say "national but heavy in FL, AZ, TX" - are you looking to focus budget primarily in those three states, or maintain national reach while over-indexing in those retirement-heavy markets?
