USER:
Hi, I'm the Marketing Manager at HomeStyle Direct. We're an e-commerce company selling home goods. I need to build a media plan for Q1-Q2. We have a $400K budget and need to acquire 5,000 new customers. Our average customer LTV is $320. Can you help me put together a plan?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business outcome. You mentioned acquiring 5,000 new customers - is customer acquisition your primary objective, or are you also looking to achieve revenue growth, market share expansion, or brand awareness alongside acquisition?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 2 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Customer acquisition is definitely our main goal right now. We're focused on growing our customer base since we're still building market presence in the home goods space. Revenue growth will naturally follow from getting more customers, but the priority is hitting that 5,000 new customer target. We might want some brand awareness as a secondary benefit, but acquisition comes first.

AGENT:
Perfect! Customer acquisition as your primary objective gives us clear direction. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success.

For tracking those 5,000 new customers, what's your primary KPI? Are you measuring first-time purchasers, new account registrations, or something else? And what attribution window works best for your business - do customers typically convert quickly, or do they research home goods over weeks before buying?

TURN 3 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We track first-time purchasers as our main KPI since that's when someone actually becomes a customer for us. Account registrations don't really matter if they don't buy anything.

For attribution, customers usually take some time to decide on home goods purchases - I'd say most convert within 2-3 weeks of first seeing our ads. People like to browse, compare options, maybe check reviews before buying furniture or décor items. So probably a 21-day attribution window would make sense for us.

AGENT:
Excellent - first-time purchasers with 21-day attribution gives us a solid measurement framework that matches your customer journey.

Now let me check your economics. With your $400K budget targeting 5,000 customers:

$400K ÷ 5,000 = $80 per customer acquisition

At $320 LTV, that projects to a 4x LTV/CAC ratio ($320 ÷ $80), which is healthy for sustainable growth. This efficiency target looks achievable for home goods e-commerce.

Before we move forward - do you have any data on your current customer acquisition costs or what you've been spending to acquire customers historically? This would help validate whether $80 per customer is realistic based on your actual performance.

TURN 4 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We've been running some campaigns but honestly our tracking hasn't been the best, so I don't have super clean CAC data. From what I can piece together, I think we've been spending somewhere around $60-90 per customer depending on the channel, but that's a rough estimate. Meta seems to be on the lower end and Google Shopping higher. The $80 target sounds reasonable based on what we've seen, maybe even a bit conservative which would be good for us.

AGENT:
That's really helpful context. Your $60-90 range confirms that $80 per customer is realistic and potentially conservative, which gives us good confidence in your target.

$400K ÷ 5,000 = $80 per customer is achievable based on your experience, and the 4x LTV/CAC ratio provides healthy unit economics for growth.

Now let's define your target audience. For HomeStyle Direct's home goods customers, what are the key characteristics of your best buyers? Think about demographics like age ranges, income levels, homeownership status, or behaviors like recent moves, home renovation projects, or shopping patterns that signal someone is likely to purchase from you.

Events: calculation_performed, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 5 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our best customers are typically homeowners aged 30-55 who are interested in home décor and furniture. They usually have decent disposable income - probably household income of $60K and up. We see a lot of people who've recently moved or are doing home renovation projects, but also just folks who like refreshing their spaces regularly.

Women tend to be our primary buyers, though we get men too especially for furniture pieces. They're usually active on social media, browse Pinterest for home inspiration, and do research online before purchasing. Many are busy professionals or parents who appreciate the convenience of shopping online for home goods rather than spending weekends at furniture stores.

AGENT:
Great profile - homeowners 30-55 with $60K+ income who are actively engaged in home improvement gives us a strong foundation. The Pinterest behavior and online research preference aligns well with your 21-day consideration window.

To refine this further, what's your primary geographic focus? Are you targeting nationally, specific regions, or certain metro areas? And within your target demographics, do you see stronger performance from any particular segments - like new homeowners versus renovators, or specific age ranges within that 30-55 bracket?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 6 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're targeting nationwide since we ship across the US, but I'd say we see better performance in suburban areas where people have houses rather than urban apartments. Makes sense since homeowners have more space to furnish and decorate.

As for segments, new homeowners seem to convert really well - they're motivated to get their place set up quickly. The 35-50 age range tends to be our sweet spot, probably because they have more established income and are past the starter home phase where they're buying nicer pieces that'll last.

AGENT:
Perfect - nationwide with suburban homeowner focus and that 35-50 sweet spot gives us clear targeting parameters. New homeowners as a high-converting segment is valuable insight.

Now for geography planning. Since you're national but perform better in suburban markets, I'd recommend focusing on the top suburban DMAs (Designated Market Areas) rather than spreading budget evenly everywhere.

Which approach would work better for your team: targeting the top 25-30 suburban-heavy DMAs where your audience is concentrated, or going broader with 50+ markets? The focused approach typically delivers better efficiency, while broader reach helps with overall scale toward your 5,000 customer target.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 7 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I think focusing on the top 25-30 suburban DMAs makes more sense for us. We'd rather be efficient with our $400K budget and hit our target cost per customer than spread too thin and potentially miss our 5,000 customer goal. Plus, if we can dial in what works well in those concentrated markets, we can always expand to more DMAs later once we have the formula down. Do you have a sense of which markets typically work best for home goods e-commerce?

AGENT:
Smart approach - concentrated efficiency in 25-30 DMAs will help you hit that $80 CAC target more reliably than spreading thin.

For home goods e-commerce, top suburban DMAs typically include markets like Atlanta, Dallas, Phoenix, Denver, Charlotte, Nashville, Austin, and Raleigh-Durham. These combine strong suburban homeowner populations with good e-commerce adoption and disposable income levels.

I'd recommend starting with the top 25 suburban DMAs ranked by household income $60K+ and homeownership rates, then layering in your historical performance data if you have any geographic insights from past campaigns.

Now let's move to budget allocation. With your $400K targeting 5,000 customers across these focused markets, how would you prefer to distribute this budget? Are you thinking equal allocation across all DMAs, or would you want to weight toward your highest-performing markets if we can identify them?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 8 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Those markets you mentioned sound spot on - Atlanta, Dallas, Phoenix definitely fit our customer profile. We've seen decent performance in Texas and Georgia markets before, though I don't have super detailed breakdowns by DMA.

I think we should weight toward the highest-performing markets rather than spread equally. Maybe start with 60-70% of budget in our top 10-15 DMAs where we know we can hit our targets, then use the remaining 30-40% to test some of those other promising markets you mentioned. That way we're not risking the whole budget on unproven areas but still have room to find new opportunities.

AGENT:
Excellent strategy - 60-70% in proven top performers with 30-40% for expansion testing gives you both reliability and growth opportunity.

So we're looking at roughly $240-280K in your top 10-15 DMAs and $120-160K testing new markets. This should help ensure you hit your 5,000 customer target while discovering new efficient markets.

Now let's develop your value proposition. For HomeStyle Direct competing in home goods, what makes you different from major players like Wayfair, Overstock, or big box retailers? Is it product selection, pricing, quality, customer service, or something else that gives you an edge with those suburban homeowners we're targeting?

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 9 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I'd say our main differentiator is that we focus on curated collections rather than overwhelming customers with thousands of options like Wayfair does. We handpick pieces that work well together so customers can easily create cohesive looks without being interior designers themselves. 

Our pricing is competitive but we're not trying to be the cheapest - we're more about that sweet spot of good quality at fair prices. We also have really strong customer service, especially helping people visualize how pieces will work in their spaces. A lot of our customers tell us they appreciate not having to sift through endless generic options to find something that actually fits their style and home.

AGENT:
Perfect - "curated collections for cohesive style without the overwhelm" is a compelling differentiator that directly addresses a real pain point in home goods shopping.

That positioning should resonate strongly with your busy professionals and parents who want their homes to look great but don't have time to become interior designers. The quality-at-fair-prices positioning also fits well with your $60K+ income target.

Now we're ready for channel strategy. Based on your acquisition objective, suburban homeowner audience, and curated positioning, I'm seeing strong potential for a multi-channel approach. 

Which channels have you tested before, and what's your comfort level with managing multiple platforms? This will help me recommend the right mix for your $400K budget and 5,000 customer target.

TURN 10 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We've mainly been running campaigns on Meta and Google Shopping, with some Pinterest testing. Meta has been our strongest performer - the visual nature works really well for home goods and we can target homeowners pretty effectively. Google Shopping drives good traffic but the CAC tends to be higher like I mentioned earlier.

Pinterest feels like a natural fit since our customers are already browsing there for home inspiration, but we haven't scaled it much yet. I'm comfortable managing multiple platforms - we have a small team that can handle 3-4 channels without getting overwhelmed. I'd rather focus on doing a few channels really well than spreading across too many and not executing properly.

AGENT:
Smart focus - 3-4 channels done well beats spreading thin across many platforms. Your experience with Meta's visual strength and Pinterest's natural fit for home inspiration makes perfect sense.

Given your $400K budget, 5,000 customer target, and channel experience, I recommend this mix:

**Meta (40% - $160K)**: Your proven performer, great for homeowner targeting
**Google Shopping (30% - $120K)**: Captures high-intent shoppers despite higher CAC  
**Pinterest (20% - $80K)**: Scale your testing with home inspiration audience
**Google Search (10% - $40K)**: Capture brand and competitor searches

This projects roughly 2,000 customers from Meta, 1,200 from Shopping, 1,000 from Pinterest, and 800 from Search, totaling your 5,000 target.

Does this allocation align with your team's capacity and comfort with scaling Pinterest while maintaining your Meta strength?
