# Media Plan Output: Volume Target Increase

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business outcome. You mentioned acquiring 5,000 new customers - is customer acquisition your primary objective, or are you also looking to achieve revenue growth, market share expansion, or brand awareness alongside acquisition?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Customer acquisition as your primary objective gives us clear direction. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success.

For tracking those 5,000 new customers, what's your primary KPI? Are you measuring first-time purchasers, new account registrations, or something else? And what attribution window works best for your business - do customers typically convert quickly, or do they research home goods over weeks before buying?

Turn 3:
Excellent - first-time purchasers with 21-day attribution gives us a solid measurement framework that matches your customer journey.

Now let me check your economics. With your $400K budget targeting 5,000 customers:

$400K ÷ 5,000 = $80 per customer acquisition

At $320 LTV, that projects to a 4x LTV/CAC ratio ($320 ÷ $80), which is healthy for sustainable growth. This efficiency target looks achievable for home goods e-commerce.

Before we move forward - do you have any data on your current customer acquisition costs or what you've been spending to acquire customers historically? This would help validate whether $80 per customer is realistic based on your actual performance.

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 5:
Great profile - homeowners 30-55 with $60K+ income who are actively engaged in home improvement gives us a strong foundation. The Pinterest behavior and online research preference aligns well with your 21-day consideration window.

To refine this further, what's your primary geographic focus? Are you targeting nationally, specific regions, or certain metro areas? And within your target demographics, do you see stronger performance from any particular segments - like new homeowners versus renovators, or specific age ranges within that 30-55 bracket?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
That's really helpful context. Your $60-90 range confirms that $80 per customer is realistic and potentially conservative, which gives us good confidence in your target.

$400K ÷ 5,000 = $80 per customer is achievable based on your experience, and the 4x LTV/CAC ratio provides healthy unit economics for growth.

Now let's define your target audience. For HomeStyle Direct's home goods customers, what are the key characteristics of your best buyers? Think about demographics like age ranges, income levels, homeownership status, or behaviors like recent moves, home renovation projects, or shopping patterns that signal someone is likely to purchase from you.

Turn 6:
Perfect - nationwide with suburban homeowner focus and that 35-50 sweet spot gives us clear targeting parameters. New homeowners as a high-converting segment is valuable insight.

Now for geography planning. Since you're national but perform better in suburban markets, I'd recommend focusing on the top suburban DMAs (Designated Market Areas) rather than spreading budget evenly everywhere.

Which approach would work better for your team: targeting the top 25-30 suburban-heavy DMAs where your audience is concentrated, or going broader with 50+ markets? The focused approach typically delivers better efficiency, while broader reach helps with overall scale toward your 5,000 customer target.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Smart approach - concentrated efficiency in 25-30 DMAs will help you hit that $80 CAC target more reliably than spreading thin.

For home goods e-commerce, top suburban DMAs typically include markets like Atlanta, Dallas, Phoenix, Denver, Charlotte, Nashville, Austin, and Raleigh-Durham. These combine strong suburban homeowner populations with good e-commerce adoption and disposable income levels.

I'd recommend starting with the top 25 suburban DMAs ranked by household income $60K+ and homeownership rates, then layering in your historical performance data if you have any geographic insights from past campaigns.

Now let's move to budget allocation. With your $400K targeting 5,000 customers across these focused markets, how would you prefer to distribute this budget? Are you thinking equal allocation across all DMAs, or would you want to weight toward your highest-performing markets if we can identify them?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Excellent strategy - 60-70% in proven top performers with 30-40% for expansion testing gives you both reliability and growth opportunity.

So we're looking at roughly $240-280K in your top 10-15 DMAs and $120-160K testing new markets. This should help ensure you hit your 5,000 customer target while discovering new efficient markets.

Now let's develop your value proposition. For HomeStyle Direct competing in home goods, what makes you different from major players like Wayfair, Overstock, or big box retailers? Is it product selection, pricing, quality, customer service, or something else that gives you an edge with those suburban homeowners we're targeting?

Turn 9:
Perfect - "curated collections for cohesive style without the overwhelm" is a compelling differentiator that directly addresses a real pain point in home goods shopping.

That positioning should resonate strongly with your busy professionals and parents who want their homes to look great but don't have time to become interior designers. The quality-at-fair-prices positioning also fits well with your $60K+ income target.

Now we're ready for channel strategy. Based on your acquisition objective, suburban homeowner audience, and curated positioning, I'm seeing strong potential for a multi-channel approach. 

Which channels have you tested before, and what's your comfort level with managing multiple platforms? This will help me recommend the right mix for your $400K budget and 5,000 customer target.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Smart focus - 3-4 channels done well beats spreading thin across many platforms. Your experience with Meta's visual strength and Pinterest's natural fit for home inspiration makes perfect sense.

Given your $400K budget, 5,000 customer target, and channel experience, I recommend this mix:

**Meta (40% - $160K)**: Your proven performer, great for homeowner targeting
**Google Shopping (30% - $120K)**: Captures high-intent shoppers despite higher CAC  
**Pinterest (20% - $80K)**: Scale your testing with home inspiration audience
**Google Search (10% - $40K)**: Capture brand and competitor searches

This projects roughly 2,000 customers from Meta, 1,200 from Shopping, 1,000 from Pinterest, and 800 from Search, totaling your 5,000 target.

Does this allocation align with your team's capacity and comfort with scaling Pinterest while maintaining your Meta strength?
