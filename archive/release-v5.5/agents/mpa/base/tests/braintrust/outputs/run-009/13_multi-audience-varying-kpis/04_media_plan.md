# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience with Different KPIs Per Segment

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! This is a sophisticated multi-objective challenge - I'm excited to build this with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've outlined three distinct business outcomes with different success definitions. Before we dive into the segment-specific economics, I need to understand the primary success metric for the overall program.

When you report results to leadership, what single number best indicates whether this $4.5M investment succeeded? Is it a blended metric across all three segments, or does one segment drive the primary evaluation?

Turn 2:
Perfect - incremental revenue with segment-specific timeframes gives us our north star. That's exactly the right approach for a multi-objective program.

Now let's establish volume targets for each segment to model the economics:

**Segment 1 (Conquest - $1.58M)**: Over 18-24 months, how many competitor vehicle owners do you need to shift into active consideration? Are we talking thousands or tens of thousands?

**Segment 2 (In-Market - $2.03M)**: How many qualified leads do you need to generate? What's your typical lead-to-sale conversion rate?

**Segment 3 (Loyalty - $900K)**: How many existing customers should take retention actions - service appointments, trade-ins, or renewals?

Starting with Segment 2 since it's your largest budget allocation and most measurable - what's your lead volume target?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it. I'll model based on a reasonable assumption, cite the source clearly, and you can refine anytime. Moving on to establish baseline economics.

**In-Market Segment**: $2.03M / 10,000 leads = $203 per lead

That's aggressive for automotive but achievable with tight targeting. Typical automotive lead costs range $150-400 depending on brand tier and geography.

For the other segments, what's your average vehicle sale value across your portfolio? This helps model conquest conversion value and determines if $203 per lead works with your margins.

Also, what's a typical service ticket value for your loyalty segment? Need this to assess whether the $900K loyalty investment can generate positive ROI within 90 days.

Turn 4:
Perfect. Let me model the economics:

**In-Market Economics**: $203 per lead with $47K average sale value
- At typical auto conversion rates (2-4%), that projects to $5,075-10,150 cost per sale
- With ~15% gross margin, that's $7K gross profit per sale
- Your implied efficiency is tight but viable if conversion hits 3%+

**Loyalty Segment**: $900K budget needs careful allocation
- Pure service plays: $450 service ticket requires $900K to generate 2,000+ appointments
- Trade-in focus: Much higher value but lower volume potential

**Conquest Challenge**: 18-24 month attribution window makes ROI measurement complex, but if you shift even 200-300 future buyers, the $1.58M investment pays off.

This efficiency assessment suggests your targets are ambitious but achievable with precise execution. The bigger question: Is your lead-to-sale conversion rate actually 3%+ across all brands, or should we model more conservatively?

Turn 6:
Excellent. Let's remodel with quality focus:

**Revised In-Market Economics**: $2.03M / 7,000 leads = $290 per lead
- At 3.5% conversion: $290 / 3.5% = $8,286 cost per sale
- With $7K gross profit per sale, you're still $1,286 underwater

We need to push cost per lead down or conversion up further. High-intent targeting typically improves conversion but increases cost per lead due to competition.

**Reality check**: Your $290 per qualified auto lead is at the premium end of market rates. Either we need:
- 4%+ conversion rates (achievable with very tight targeting)
- Higher average sale values through luxury brand weighting
- Or accept thinner margins as customer acquisition investment

Before we optimize further, what's your typical customer lifetime value beyond the initial sale? Service, repeat purchases, referrals? This changes the acquisition economics significantly if we're modeling long-term value vs. first-sale breakeven.

Turn 7:
Exactly right. Let's model luxury brand weighting:

**Luxury Brand Focus**: $65K sale with 15% margin = $9,750 gross profit
- At $290 per lead and 3.5% conversion = $8,286 cost per sale
- **Profit per sale**: $1,464 before LTV
- **With service LTV**: $4,464-6,464 total customer value

The math works beautifully for luxury. Even at conservative 3% conversion, you're profitable.

**Revised Strategy**: Weight 60-70% of in-market budget toward luxury targeting, 30-40% toward volume brands in highest-intent scenarios only.

This projects to roughly:
- 3,000 luxury-focused leads 
- 4,000 volume brand leads (ultra-high intent only)
- Blended efficiency that works financially

Your conquest and loyalty segments look solid at their allocations. Ready to move to audience definition, or do you want to refine the lead allocation between luxury and volume brands first?

Turn 8:
Perfect - let's define your audiences with precision that matches your efficiency targets.

Starting with **Segment 2 (In-Market)** since it's your largest investment and needs the tightest targeting:

For your **luxury-focused leads** (60% of in-market budget), what specific behavioral signals indicate someone is actively shopping for a $65K+ vehicle? 

Are we talking about people visiting luxury brand websites, researching specific models on Autotrader/Cars.com, or do you have insights about competitor service customers approaching lease-end? The more precise we get here, the better that 3.5%+ conversion rate becomes achievable.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Smart approach - let's model conservatively. At 2.5% conversion:

$203 per lead / 2.5% conversion = $8,120 cost per sale

With $47K average sale and 15% margin ($7K gross profit), you're losing $1,120 per sale. The math doesn't work at current efficiency.

**Three paths forward:**
1. **Improve lead quality** - Target higher-intent audiences, accept fewer leads at better conversion rates
2. **Reduce cost per lead** - Need to hit ~$175 per lead to break even at 2.5% conversion  
3. **Blend higher-margin opportunities** - Weight more budget toward luxury brand or loyalty trade-ins

Given your attribution challenges, I'd recommend Path 1 - tighter targeting for quality over quantity. This might mean 6,000-8,000 higher-converting leads instead of 10,000.

Should we model a more conservative lead target with better assumed conversion, or explore how much lead cost reduction you'd need?

Turn 10:
Smart multi-tier conquest strategy. The conquest-up play from loaded volume vehicles is particularly clever - those customers are already demonstrating willingness to pay for premium features.

**Conquest Audience Structure**:
- **Luxury lateral**: Current BMW/Mercedes/Audi owners (2-4 years into ownership cycle)  
- **Volume lateral**: Toyota/Honda/Nissan owners approaching typical trade cycle
- **Conquest-up**: Owners of loaded Camry/Accord/Altima (3-4 years old, showing premium feature preference)

For **Segment 3 (Loyalty)**, you mentioned service due, trade-in cycle, and contract expiration. How do you identify these customers? Do you have first-party data on service intervals and lease/loan maturity dates, or are you modeling based on purchase timing and typical ownership cycles?

This determines whether we can do precise CRM-based targeting or need to model behavioral signals for existing customers.

Turn 11:
Perfect - you have strong first-party foundation with clear gaps to fill.

**Loyalty Audience Precision**:
- **Service due**: CRM customers 4-6+ months since last visit + mileage-based service intervals
- **Trade-in ready**: Lease expiration (6-12 months out) + loan payoff modeling  
- **Contract expiration**: Extended warranty/service contract end dates
- **Gap customers**: Third-party data for off-site servicers + behavioral signals for external purchasers

Now for geography - with 12 dealerships across 3 brands, are your locations clustered in specific metro areas, or spread across multiple states? This affects whether we target broad DMAs or need corridor-level precision within markets.

Also, do different dealerships handle different brands, or do some locations carry multiple brands? This impacts how we allocate budget geographically.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 9:
Excellent targeting strategy. That layered approach - behavioral signals + financial qualification + competitor lease-end timing - should definitely drive 3.5%+ conversion.

**Luxury Audience Precision**: 
- Third-party auto site engagement ($50K+ vehicles)
- Competitor luxury brand website activity  
- Lease expiration targeting (6-12 months out)
- $100K+ household income + prime credit
- Active shopping recency (30-60 days)

That's 4-5 targeting layers creating a highly qualified pool.

Now for **Segment 1 (Conquest)** - your awareness play targeting competitor vehicle owners for future consideration. What specific competitor brands are you trying to pull from? Are we talking about owners of similar-tier vehicles, or are you trying to conquest up-market from lower-tier brands as well?

This affects whether we target current BMW owners to consider your luxury brand, or current Honda owners to consider your volume brand.

Turn 13:
Perfect geographic allocation strategy. That brand-location mapping prevents waste and maximizes fulfillment capability.

**Geographic Budget Weighting**:
- **Top 2 metros**: 60% of total budget ($2.7M)
- **Secondary metros**: 40% of total budget ($1.8M)
- **Luxury geo-fencing**: 75-mile radius around 3 specific luxury locations only
- **Volume/mid-tier**: All 4 metros with 50-mile radius around relevant dealerships

Now let's validate your total budget allocation across segments:

- **Conquest**: $1.58M (35%) - Brand awareness across 4 metros
- **In-Market**: $2.03M (45%) - 7,000 quality leads, weighted 60% luxury
- **Loyalty**: $900K (20%) - CRM-based retention actions

Does this $4.5M total feel realistic for your market position and growth objectives? Are there seasonal considerations or competitive factors that might require budget flexibility reserves?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 12:
Excellent geographic clarity. That radius strategy maximizes each dealership's pull while recognizing luxury customers' travel flexibility.

**Geographic Framework**:
- **Standard radius**: 50 miles (conquest + in-market)
- **Luxury radius**: 75 miles (higher value justifies travel)
- **Loyalty targeting**: CRM-based (geography irrelevant)

**Budget allocation question**: Should we weight spend toward your higher-performing metro areas, or distribute evenly across all 4 markets? 

Also, with dealerships handling different brands, do we need to ensure luxury brand spend concentrates around those 3 luxury locations, or can luxury prospects reasonably travel to any of your 12 dealerships for luxury inventory?

This affects whether we geo-fence tightly around brand-specific locations or can spread luxury budget across all 4 metro areas.

Turn 14:
Smart seasonal strategy. Holding reserves for peak conversion periods maximizes ROI.

**Seasonal Budget Framework**:
- **Base allocation**: 85-90% of $4.5M ($3.83M-4.05M)
- **Seasonal reserve**: 10-15% ($450K-675K) for Q4 and spring peaks
- **Conquest flex**: Weight awareness spend toward high-consideration windows

Your value proposition is the next critical piece. With three distinct segments and seasonal dynamics, each needs different messaging:

**Conquest** needs long-term brand positioning, **In-Market** needs immediate purchase drivers, **Loyalty** needs retention incentives.

Starting with your **In-Market luxury focus** - what's your key differentiator when someone's actively shopping $65K vehicles? Is it inventory selection, financing terms, service experience, or something else that pulls them from competitors at decision time?

Turn 15:
Excellent luxury positioning - the concierge experience plus immediate availability is a powerful combination.

**Luxury Value Proposition**:
- **Primary**: Concierge-level ownership experience (dedicated advisors, matching loaners, full-service support)
- **Secondary**: Superior financing through multi-brand relationships
- **Urgency driver**: In-stock luxury inventory, immediate delivery vs. factory wait times

For **Volume/Mid-Tier In-Market**, what's your key differentiator? Are you competing on price, selection, financing accessibility, or something else when someone's shopping $35-45K vehicles?

The value prop likely shifts significantly from luxury's relationship focus to more practical purchase drivers at volume price points.

Turn 16:
Perfect positioning - you're solving the multi-brand shopping complexity while providing financing access others can't match.

**Volume/Mid-Tier Value Proposition**:
- **Primary**: Financing accessibility (multiple lenders, broader approval capability)
- **Secondary**: Multi-brand convenience (compare options under one roof)
- **Deal advantage**: Better trade values + service flexibility across brands
- **Friction reduction**: Complete solution vs. lowest price

Now for **Channels** - with your three distinct segments and value propositions defined, let's map the optimal media mix.

**In-Market** needs high-intent channels where active shoppers live. **Conquest** needs broad reach for awareness building. **Loyalty** leverages owned channels plus targeted digital.

Starting with your **In-Market luxury focus** - which channels currently deliver your highest-converting luxury leads? Paid search, third-party auto sites, social targeting, or something else?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 17:
Excellent channel performance insights. You've identified the full funnel - search captures intent, social enables precise targeting, YouTube builds awareness with retargeting capability.

**Luxury In-Market Channel Mix Recommendation**:
- **40% Paid Search** - Brand/model terms, high-intent capture
- **25% Paid Social** - Layered targeting (income + behavior + lookalikes)  
- **20% Third-Party Auto Sites** - Strategic inventory promotion despite cost
- **15% YouTube Pre-Roll** - Luxury lifestyle targeting with retargeting sequences

For **Volume/Mid-Tier In-Market**, do the same channels work, or do you need different approaches? Volume customers might have different research behaviors - more price-focused search terms, different social platforms, broader third-party site usage?

Turn 18:
Perfect channel adaptation - volume customers research more broadly and focus on practical value drivers.

**Volume/Mid-Tier In-Market Channel Mix Recommendation**:
- **30% Third-Party Auto Sites** - Broader comparison shopping behavior
- **25% Paid Search** - Generic terms, financing-focused copy
- **25% Facebook** - Financing accessibility, multi-brand messaging
- **15% YouTube** - Financial/family content targeting
- **5% Display Retargeting** - Price/deal-focused creative

**Conquest Channels** need broad reach for awareness building across that 18-24 month window. For competitor vehicle owners, are you thinking traditional awareness channels like Connected TV, radio, and display, or can digital channels like YouTube and social provide sufficient reach at better targeting precision?

Your luxury lateral conquest versus volume conquest-up strategies might need different channel approaches too.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 19:
Excellent conquest strategy - matching channel selection to customer digital behavior and purchase timeline.

**Conquest Channel Mix Recommendation**:

**Luxury Lateral** (40% of conquest budget):
- **35% YouTube** - Premium inventory, competitor owner targeting
- **30% Premium Display** - Programmatic with vehicle ownership data
- **25% Paid Social** - LinkedIn/Instagram, sophisticated creative
- **10% Audio/Podcast** - Premium content alignment

**Conquest-Up** (60% of conquest budget):
- **40% Connected TV** - Broad reach, primetime frequency
- **25% Radio** - Commute-time awareness building  
- **20% YouTube** - Broader lifestyle targeting
- **15% Strategic OOH** - High-traffic corridor presence

**Loyalty Channels** should leverage your CRM strength. Are you thinking email sequences, direct mail for high-value opportunities, plus digital retargeting to existing customers, or do you have other owned channel capabilities?

Turn 20:
Perfect loyalty channel strategy - leveraging owned data for personalized, high-conversion touchpoints.

**Loyalty Channel Mix Recommendation**:
- **40% Email Marketing** - Automated sequences, service intervals, ownership milestones
- **25% Digital Retargeting** - Display/social to existing customers, higher conversion rates
- **20% Direct Mail** - High-value opportunities (lease expiration, trade-in consideration)
- **10% SMS** - Service reminders, appointment confirmations
- **5% DMS Integration** - Automated triggers from actual service data

Now for **Measurement** - with three segments having different success timelines, we need segment-specific measurement approaches.

**In-Market** can use standard lead attribution and conversion tracking. **Loyalty** measures retention actions within 90 days. But **Conquest** presents the biggest measurement challenge with that 18-24 month attribution window.

How do you plan to measure conquest effectiveness when the revenue impact won't show up for years? Brand lift studies, consideration tracking, or do you have other approaches in mind?
