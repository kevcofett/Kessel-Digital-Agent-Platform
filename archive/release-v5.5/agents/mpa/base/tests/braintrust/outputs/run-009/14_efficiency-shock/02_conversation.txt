TURN 1 (Step 1)

USER:
Hi, I'm the Director of Digital Marketing at SecureLife Insurance. We sell life and annuity products. I need to build a media plan for next year. We have a $750K budget and need 15,000 new policy applications. Our average LTV is about $2,800 per policyholder. Can you help?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect starting data - $750K budget for 15,000 applications gives us a clear efficiency target. Let me run the math: $750K ÷ 15,000 = $50 per application. With $2,800 LTV, that projects to a strong 56:1 LTV-to-acquisition ratio.

This is very achievable for insurance - industry benchmarks typically show $40-80 per application depending on product mix and targeting precision.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 15,000 applications? For example, are you focused on premium growth, market share expansion, or entering new customer segments?

USER:
Great, those benchmarks are reassuring. Our primary goal is premium growth - we need to hit our annual revenue targets and the executive team is pushing hard on new customer acquisition. We're also looking to expand our reach into some younger demographics, maybe capture more of that 35-45 age group since they're starting families and thinking about protection. Market share would be nice too, but revenue growth is the main driver here.

AGENT:
Excellent - premium growth through new customer acquisition is clear. The 35-45 demographic focus makes strategic sense as that's prime life insurance consideration age.

Let me clarify one key measurement point: when you say 15,000 "policy applications," are these qualified applications that convert to policies at a predictable rate, or do you need 15,000 actual issued policies? 

This matters because if applications convert at, say, 60%, then 15,000 applications would yield about 9,000 policies. But if you need 15,000 actual policies, we'd need roughly 25,000 applications, changing our efficiency target significantly.

What's your typical application-to-policy conversion rate?

TURN 3 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our conversion rate is usually around 65%, so we're talking about qualified applications that we expect to convert. The 15,000 applications should give us roughly 9,750 issued policies, which should hit our revenue targets based on our average premium per policy. I should clarify though - when I say "qualified," these are people who've completed the full application process, not just initial leads.

AGENT:
Perfect - 15,000 qualified applications converting at 65% to 9,750 policies gives us a solid foundation. Your $50 per qualified application target is realistic for insurance.

Now let's validate the economics. With $2,800 LTV per policyholder, your 9,750 issued policies project to roughly $27.3 million in lifetime value against your $750K investment. That's excellent unit economics.

One key question: Is that $2,800 LTV based on first-year premiums or true lifetime value over the full policy term? Insurance LTV calculations vary widely - some use 3-5 year value, others model full policy lifetime. 

Understanding this helps ensure our $50 acquisition cost aligns with your actual payback timeline and profitability requirements.

TURN 4 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
That $2,800 is our 5-year LTV calculation - it includes premiums, renewals, and cross-sell opportunities over that timeframe. We don't really model out the full policy lifetime since there are too many variables, but our actuarial team feels confident about the 5-year projections. Our margins are pretty healthy at around 55%, so even with the $50 CAC, we should see positive ROI within the first 18 months or so.

AGENT:
Excellent - $2,800 over 5 years with 55% margins gives you strong unit economics. At $50 per qualified application, you'll achieve positive ROI well within 18 months, which is healthy for insurance acquisition.

Your efficiency target is realistic and your economics are sound. We have a solid foundation for Steps 1-2.

Moving to Step 3 - Audience. You mentioned wanting to expand into the 35-45 demographic for families starting to think about protection. 

What does your current customer base look like demographically? Understanding who converts best today will help us balance proven segments with your expansion goals into younger demographics.

TURN 5 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our current customer base skews a bit older - probably 45-60 is our sweet spot right now, with good representation of families who already have mortgages and established financial responsibilities. We do well with middle to upper-middle income households, typically dual-income families or single high earners. The challenge is that we're not capturing enough of those younger families in the 35-45 range who are just starting to think seriously about life insurance after having kids or buying their first home.

AGENT:
Great context - your proven 45-60 segment with established financial responsibilities gives us a strong foundation, while the 35-45 expansion represents clear growth opportunity.

For the 35-45 segment specifically, what life events or circumstances typically trigger their interest in life insurance? You mentioned having kids and first home purchases - are there other key moments when this demographic becomes most receptive to life insurance messaging?

Understanding these trigger events helps us identify the right behavioral signals for targeting beyond just age demographics.

TURN 6 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
The main triggers we see are definitely new babies - that's huge for driving urgency around protection. Home purchases are big too, especially when they're taking on a mortgage for the first time. We also see upticks around job changes, particularly when someone gets promoted or switches to a higher salary role and starts thinking more seriously about their financial responsibilities. Divorce is another one, though that's harder to target. Sometimes it's just hitting certain age milestones like 35 or 40 where people start getting more serious about their financial planning overall.

AGENT:
Perfect - those are strong behavioral triggers: new babies, first mortgages, job promotions, and age milestones. These life events create natural urgency and receptivity that we can target effectively.

Let me get a sense of audience scale. In your target markets, roughly how many households fit your ideal profile? For example, if we're targeting 35-45 year-olds with new babies or recent home purchases in middle-to-upper income brackets, are we looking at hundreds of thousands or millions of potential households?

This helps determine if we have sufficient audience scale to support your 15,000 application goal, or if we need to broaden the targeting approach.

TURN 7 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I'd estimate we're looking at several million households nationwide that fit our profile. The 35-45 age group with middle to upper-middle income is pretty substantial, and when you layer in the life event triggers like new babies or home purchases, we're still talking about hundreds of thousands of households annually. Our current customer acquisition only captures a tiny fraction of that market, so there's definitely enough scale to support 15,000 applications. The challenge has been reaching them at the right moment when they're actively considering life insurance rather than just eligible for it.

AGENT:
Excellent - several million households with hundreds of thousands experiencing key life events annually gives us massive scale. You're right that timing is everything - reaching them when they're actively considering, not just eligible.

Moving to Step 4 - Geography. Are you targeting nationwide, or do you have specific states or regions where you're licensed to sell? Insurance regulations vary significantly by state, so understanding your geographic scope will shape our targeting approach.

Also, do you see better performance in certain regions currently, or any areas you specifically want to prioritize for growth?
