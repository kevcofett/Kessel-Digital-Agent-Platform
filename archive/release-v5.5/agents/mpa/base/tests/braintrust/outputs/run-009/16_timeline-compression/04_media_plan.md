# Media Plan Output: Timeline Compression

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your primary objective. You mentioned acquiring 25,000 new customers - is customer acquisition your main business outcome, or are you also focused on revenue targets, brand awareness, or retention alongside acquisition?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Customer acquisition as your primary objective with 25,000 new customers as your north star metric gives us a clear target.

Now let me check your efficiency target: $1.2M ÷ 25,000 = $48 per customer acquisition cost (CAC). With your $180 LTV, that projects to a 3.75x LTV/CAC ratio, which is strong and sustainable for fashion retail.

This $48 CAC target is achievable but will require disciplined execution. Fashion retail typically sees CACs ranging from $35-65 depending on channels and audience precision.

Is this $48 CAC efficiency target realistic based on any previous campaign performance you've seen, or should we model scenarios around different efficiency levels?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - your channel experience validates that $48 CAC target perfectly. The fact that you're already seeing $42-55 across channels with Instagram at $45 and Google at $60 gives us solid benchmarks to work with.

Your point about quality customers is crucial - some channels may justify higher CACs if they deliver better retention or higher repeat purchase rates. We'll factor that into channel selection in Step 7.

With your objective and economics locked in, let's move to audience definition. For Urban Essentials, who is your ideal customer? I'm looking for the core demographic and psychographic profile that drives the majority of your sales - age range, lifestyle characteristics, shopping behaviors, anything that defines your best customers.

Turn 4:
Perfect profile - fashion-forward urban women 25-45 who view fashion as identity curation. This audience values authenticity and discovers brands through social platforms, which aligns well with your Instagram efficiency at $45 CAC.

One key consideration: this audience spans a 20-year age range with different shopping behaviors. The 25-35 segment likely skews more TikTok and impulse-driven, while 35-45 may be more deliberate purchasers on Instagram and Google.

Should we segment this into two cohorts for targeting precision, or do you see consistent behavior patterns across the full 25-45 range that suggest treating them as one unified audience?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Excellent - two cohorts will definitely improve targeting precision and creative relevance. Let's define these segments:

**Cohort 1: Trendsetters (25-35)**
- More spontaneous purchasing behavior
- High TikTok engagement 
- Impulse-driven fashion decisions

**Cohort 2: Curators (35-45)**
- Research-driven purchase process
- Instagram discovery, Google conversion
- More deliberate fashion investments

For audience sizing, I need to understand your geographic footprint. When you mentioned "urban areas and tier 2 cities," are you targeting nationally across all major metros, or do you have specific markets where Urban Essentials has stronger brand presence or distribution advantages?

Turn 6:
Perfect - national expansion with efficiency-focused allocation makes strategic sense. Since you're building national presence evenly, we'll want to identify DMAs with the highest concentration of fashion-forward urban women 25-45 for optimal spend efficiency.

Based on your target audience, I'm thinking we focus on approximately 40-50 DMAs that combine:
- High population density of your demographic
- Strong digital engagement rates
- Urban/metropolitan characteristics
- Mix of tier 1 and tier 2 markets

This would include your proven markets like Austin, Nashville, Portland alongside major metros, but exclude rural or demographically misaligned DMAs where your $48 CAC target would be harder to achieve.

Does concentrating on the top 40-50 DMAs align with your national expansion goals, or do you need broader geographic coverage even if some markets are less efficient?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Excellent - 40-50 high-concentration DMAs gives us the focused national presence you need while protecting that $48 CAC target.

Now let's talk budget allocation. With $1.2M total budget and two audience cohorts across 40-50 DMAs, I'm thinking about how to distribute this effectively.

A few key considerations: Your Trendsetters (25-35) may need higher frequency on TikTok and Instagram, while Curators (35-45) might require more touchpoints across the research journey. Also, some DMAs will be more expensive than others - NYC and LA will cost more per impression than Austin or Nashville.

What's your thinking on budget flexibility? Should we allocate evenly across cohorts and let performance data guide reallocation, or do you have a hypothesis about which segment might be more efficient to prioritize initially?

Turn 8:
Smart allocation - 60/40 favoring Curators leverages your proven Instagram performance and their higher purchase intent. That splits to roughly $720K for Curators and $480K for Trendsetters.

Your point about flexibility is crucial. I'd recommend holding back 10-15% as a reallocation reserve - about $120-180K that can shift between cohorts based on performance signals after the first 6-8 weeks.

This gives us:
- **Curators (35-45)**: ~$600K committed + flex allocation
- **Trendsetters (25-35)**: ~$400K committed + flex allocation  
- **Flexibility Reserve**: ~$150K for optimization shifts

The reserve lets you double down on what's working without being locked into initial assumptions. Does this structure give you the agility you need while maintaining focus on the higher-intent Curators segment?

Turn 9:
Perfect! The budget structure with flexibility reserve sets you up for both aggressive scaling and risk management.

Now let's define your value proposition for each cohort. This will drive creative messaging and channel positioning.

For your **Curators (35-45)** - the research-driven segment that converts through deliberate fashion investments - what's the core value proposition that resonates most? Is it quality and craftsmanship, versatile pieces that work across occasions, the curation aspect of building a cohesive wardrobe, or something else that speaks to their more intentional shopping mindset?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Excellent - "timeless versatility with quality construction" perfectly captures their cost-per-wear mindset and deliberate purchasing approach.

**Curators Value Proposition**: Investment pieces that seamlessly transition across occasions - quality construction meets effortless versatility for the modern woman building a cohesive, timeless wardrobe.

Now for your **Trendsetters (25-35)** - the spontaneous, TikTok-engaged segment. Given their impulse-driven behavior and identity curation through fashion, what value proposition drives their purchasing decisions? Is it about being first to discover emerging trends, expressing individuality, accessible luxury, or the social currency of wearing something Instagram-worthy?

Turn 11:
Perfect! Two distinct value propositions that align beautifully with each cohort's mindset and shopping behavior.

**Trendsetters Value Proposition**: Discover-first fashion that elevates your personal brand - accessible luxury pieces designed for self-expression and social currency, helping you stand out in the cultural conversation.

**Curators Value Proposition**: Investment pieces that seamlessly transition across occasions - quality construction meets effortless versatility for the modern woman building a cohesive, timeless wardrobe.

Now we're ready for channel strategy. Based on everything we've established - your $48 CAC target, two distinct cohorts, national DMA focus, and differentiated value propositions - which channels are you currently using, and are there any you're particularly interested in testing or scaling up?
