# Media Plan Output: Audience Addition Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

I can see you're targeting qualified leads for wealth management - that's a strong foundation. To make sure we define success precisely, what specific business outcome happens after you generate those 5,000 qualified leads? Are you measuring lead-to-client conversion, total new AUM, or revenue from new clients?

Turn 2:
Perfect! So your primary objective is new AUM acquisition, targeting $900M-$1.2B in new assets from 750-1,000 converted clients. That's a clear success framework.

Let me run the efficiency math: $2M budget ÷ 5,000 leads = $400 cost per qualified lead. With your 15-20% conversion rate, that projects to $2,000-$2,667 per new client acquisition cost.

At $15K LTV per client, this gives you a 5.6x to 7.5x LTV/CAC ratio - that's exceptionally strong economics for wealth management where client relationships span decades.

Your target efficiency looks very achievable for this vertical. High-net-worth lead generation typically runs $300-$800 per qualified lead depending on channel mix and audience precision.

Now let's move to your audience definition. You mentioned HNW individuals 55+ with $1M+ investable assets approaching retirement. What behavioral or life event signals help you identify prospects who are actively seeking wealth management services versus those who are satisfied with their current advisor?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - those life transition and active research signals are gold for wealth management targeting. Those behavioral indicators typically improve conversion rates by 40-60% versus demographic-only targeting.

Let me clarify one key point: when you say "qualified leads," what specific criteria make a lead qualified? For example, do they need to complete a financial assessment, schedule a consultation, or meet minimum asset verification? 

This matters because different qualification levels affect both your $400 per lead efficiency and downstream conversion rates. A lead who books a consultation converts differently than someone who just downloads a retirement guide.

Turn 4:
Perfect - that's a high-quality qualification standard. Someone who completes a financial assessment AND books a consultation is genuinely engaged. That validates your 15-20% conversion rate and supports the $400 per qualified lead efficiency.

Your economics look solid: $2M budget targeting 5,000 consultation-booked leads at $400 each, converting to 750-1,000 clients at $2,000-$2,667 CAC with $15K LTV. That's a defensible 5.6x to 7.5x return.

Now let's define your audience more precisely. Within that 55+ HNW segment experiencing life transitions, are there specific wealth levels or professional backgrounds that convert best? For example, do recently retired executives respond differently than business owners, or does the $1M-$3M segment behave differently from $3M+ prospects?

Turn 5:
Excellent segmentation insights. Recently retired executives as your highest converters makes perfect sense - they have immediate need, decision-making authority, and complex assets requiring professional management.

Your $1M-$3M sweet spot is smart positioning - above the robo-advisor threshold but below family office competition. The $3M+ segment trade-off of lower conversion but higher AUM value gives you good portfolio balance.

Based on this, I'm seeing three primary audience segments:
1. Recently retired executives ($1M-$5M assets) - highest conversion priority
2. Business owners in transition ($1M-$3M) - longer sales cycle but solid volume
3. High-net-worth prospects ($3M+) - lower volume, higher value

Within your top 30 wealth markets, do you see meaningful geographic performance differences? Do prospects in traditional wealth centers like NYC or San Francisco behave differently than emerging markets like Austin or Nashville?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Perfect insights - that competitive dynamic is exactly what I see across wealth management campaigns. Traditional centers have higher CACs but faster decision cycles, while emerging markets offer better efficiency with longer nurture requirements.

This geographic variation will be crucial for your budget allocation and channel strategy. You'll likely want different approaches for saturated versus emerging markets.

Let me model your audience sizing across those 30 markets. With recently retired executives as your primary segment, business owners secondary, and $3M+ prospects tertiary, we're looking at a fairly targeted universe within each DMA.

Before we map the specific markets, what's your current geographic mix? Are you already strong in certain markets where you can optimize existing presence, or are you looking to expand into new territories with this $2M investment?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Excellent strategic thinking. The Southeast expansion focus makes strong sense - corporate relocations are bringing your ideal prospects (recently retired executives) to markets with lower competitive intensity and media costs. Charlotte and Atlanta especially have that sweet spot of financial services familiarity without the saturation of traditional wealth centers.

So we're looking at:
- Established markets (40% / $800K): NYC, Boston, Chicago, California markets
- Southeast expansion (60% / $1.2M): Atlanta, Charlotte, Nashville plus 2-3 additional markets

This gives you geographic diversification while concentrating firepower where you have the best efficiency opportunity.

Now let's talk value proposition. Given that emerging market prospects often need more education about wealth management value, while established market prospects are sophisticated but heavily courted - how do you typically differentiate WealthPath from competitors? What's your core value proposition that resonates most with these HNW prospects considering a switch?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Smart allocation thinking - 60% toward emerging markets makes sense given your diminishing returns in established territories. That competitive saturation in traditional centers means you're likely paying premium CPMs for lower conversion rates.

Your 40/60 split suggests $800K for optimizing established markets and $1.2M for expansion. Let me check this math: 

Established markets (40%): $800K targeting ~2,000 qualified leads at potentially higher CAC due to competition
Emerging markets (60%): $1.2M targeting ~3,000 qualified leads at more efficient rates

Does this breakdown align with your expectations? And within those emerging markets, do you have preference for Southeast expansion (Atlanta, Charlotte, Nashville) versus Western growth (Austin, Denver, Phoenix), or should we evaluate based purely on audience density and competitive landscape?

Turn 9:
Perfect positioning - that comprehensive retirement income architecture versus traditional asset management is a strong differentiator. Your dual messaging approach is smart: fiduciary trust for sophisticated established markets, educational planning value for emerging markets.

The proprietary tools for tax-efficient withdrawals and Social Security optimization are particularly compelling for your 55+ audience. Those are complex, high-value services that justify advisory fees and create switching motivation.

With your value proposition defined, let's move to budget allocation by segment. Within your $800K established markets budget and $1.2M emerging markets budget, how do you want to weight investment across your three audience segments?

Should we prioritize recently retired executives (highest conversion) across both geographies, or do you want different segment emphasis between established versus emerging markets based on audience availability and competitive dynamics?

Turn 10:
That allocation is strategically sound. Let me break down the math:

**Established Markets ($800K):**
- Recently retired executives (70%): $560K
- $3M+ prospects (30%): $240K

**Emerging Markets ($1.2M):**
- Recently retired executives (55%): $660K  
- Business owners (35%): $420K
- $3M+ prospects (10%): $120K

This gives you $1.22M total focused on executives across both geographies - smart given their highest conversion rates. The heavier business owner weighting in emerging markets (35% vs 0%) makes perfect sense since those markets have more untapped entrepreneurs.

Your instinct about audience density is spot-on. Traditional wealth centers have concentrated $3M+ prospects worth targeting, while emerging markets offer that underserved business owner opportunity.

Now we're ready for channels. Given your sophisticated audience segments, geographic split, and need for both education (emerging) and differentiation (established), what channels are you currently using or considering? We'll want to match channel strengths to your segment and geography strategy.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Your current mix makes sense but we can definitely optimize the allocation. For HNW wealth management, I typically see these channel performance patterns:

**Highest performers:**
- LinkedIn (executive targeting precision)
- Google Search (high-intent retirement queries) 
- Direct mail (still works exceptionally well for 55+ HNW)
- Seminars/webinars (education + relationship building)

**Strong supporting channels:**
- Programmatic display (retargeting and lookalikes)
- Connected TV (reaches cord-cutting executives)
- Financial publication sponsorships

Given your $2M budget and geographic strategy, I'd recommend this allocation:

**Established Markets ($800K):**
- LinkedIn: 35% ($280K) - executive precision targeting
- Direct mail: 30% ($240K) - proven HNW channel
- Google Search: 20% ($160K) - capture high intent
- Programmatic: 15% ($120K) - retargeting support

**Emerging Markets ($1.2M):**
- Seminars/webinars: 40% ($480K) - education emphasis
- LinkedIn: 25% ($300K) - business owner targeting  
- Google Search: 20% ($240K) - retirement planning queries
- Connected TV: 15% ($180K) - broad executive reach

Does this channel mix align with your capacity for seminar execution and comfort with digital precision targeting?

Turn 12:
Great point on seminar capacity - that's a significant operational commitment. We could adjust that allocation if needed, perhaps shifting some seminar budget to LinkedIn or adding financial publication sponsorships in emerging markets to maintain the education focus with less operational complexity.

The Connected TV opportunity is strong for your demographic - executives streaming premium financial content on platforms like Bloomberg, CNBC apps, or even general premium content where we can layer in your wealth targeting.

Now let's establish measurement. With your qualified lead definition (financial assessment + consultation booking) and 15-20% conversion rates, what's your current tracking setup? Can you measure lead quality by source, and do you have attribution for the full journey from first touch to new client AUM?

This matters because with a 60-90 day consideration cycle typical for wealth management, we'll need proper attribution to optimize spend across your channel mix and geographic segments.
