# Media Plan Output: Sophisticated User - IDK Protocol

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

$500K / 10,000 = $50 per user acquisition. That's aggressive but achievable for fintech remittance if we execute precisely.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 10,000 new users - is this about transaction volume, revenue growth, or market expansion into new corridors?

Turn 2:
Perfect - proving unit economics at scale is the right foundation. Your $50 CAC target is tight for remittance, where industry benchmarks typically show $75-150 depending on corridor and customer LTV.

To assess if $50 is realistic, I need to understand your customer value. What's the average revenue per user over their first 6-12 months? For context, successful remittance companies typically see $40-80 in take rate revenue per active user annually, but this varies significantly by send frequency and corridor mix.

Turn 5:
Perfect strategy - start conservative with upside optionality. Now let's build the audience precision that makes aggressive efficiency possible.

High-performing remittance campaigns typically target 15-25 behavioral and demographic signals. The most efficient segments are:

**PRIMARY SIGNALS (highest conversion)**
- Recent immigrants (0-5 years in country)
- Specific corridor dominance (Mexico-US, Philippines-US, etc.)
- Age 25-45 with household income $35K-75K
- Employed in service, construction, healthcare sectors

**BEHAVIORAL SIGNALS (efficiency multipliers)**
- Western Union/MoneyGram users (proven send behavior)
- Mobile banking app users
- Cross-border e-commerce purchasers
- International calling card buyers

**GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION**
- Metro areas with 15%+ immigrant population
- Zip codes with high remittance volume density

For your corridors specifically - which countries/regions do your current users send to most frequently? And do you have any data on what acquisition sources have driven your highest-LTV customers so far?

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Absolutely - modeling both scenarios gives you strategic options for leadership discussions.

**AGGRESSIVE SCENARIO: $50 CAC**
$500K budget = 10,000 users at $50 each
Revenue projection: 10,000 × $65 = $650K first-year revenue
Challenge: Requires top 10% channel efficiency

**CONSERVATIVE SCENARIO: $75 CAC** 
$500K budget = 6,667 users at $75 each
Revenue projection: 6,667 × $65 = $433K first-year revenue
Advantage: 2x higher success probability, better optimization runway

**ALTERNATIVE: BUDGET INCREASE**
10,000 users × $75 = $750K budget needed
Revenue projection: 10,000 × $65 = $650K first-year revenue

The conservative approach actually de-risks your quarter significantly. Missing 10K at $50 CAC could mean 6,000-7,000 users and damaged credibility. Hitting 6,667 at $75 CAC builds confidence for future budget increases.

Before we dive into audience targeting that could make $50 work - what's leadership's bigger priority: hitting the exact 10K number or proving sustainable acquisition economics?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it. I'll model using $65 average first-year revenue per user based on your range. You can refine this as cohort data matures.

$65 revenue at typical 2-3% remittance take rates suggests your users are sending $2,200-3,200 annually, which is solid volume.

Your $50 CAC target is aggressive but not impossible. Here's the reality: $65 revenue / $50 CAC = 1.3x ratio. Industry typically aims for 3x+ for healthy unit economics after operational costs.

However, early-stage fintechs can justify tighter ratios if:
- LTV extends beyond year 1 (retention matters hugely)
- You're building toward network effects
- Operational leverage improves margins over time

This is ambitious. To hit $50 CAC, we'll need extremely tight audience targeting and channel efficiency. The alternative is adjusting either the 10K target or budget to more conservative $75-100 CAC range.

What's your take - push for the aggressive efficiency or model more conservative scenarios?
