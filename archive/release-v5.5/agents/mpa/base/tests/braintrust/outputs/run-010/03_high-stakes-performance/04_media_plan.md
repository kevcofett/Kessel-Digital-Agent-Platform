# Media Plan Output: High-Stakes Performance Campaign

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your business outcome. You mentioned acquiring 50,000 new merchants - is merchant acquisition your primary objective, or are there other business outcomes like increasing transaction volume or expanding into new verticals that should be part of this plan?

Turn 2:
Perfect! So merchant acquisition is your primary objective with geographic expansion as a secondary goal. Now I need to clarify how you'll measure success.

You mentioned 50,000 new merchants as your main KPI - when you say "new merchants," are you counting any business that signs up, or do you have a specific activation threshold? For example, do they need to process their first transaction, hit a minimum processing volume, or stay active for a certain period to count toward your 50,000?

Turn 4:
Got it - moving from $65-70 to $40 CAC is ambitious but shows good strategic thinking. The secondary market expansion could definitely help, as competition is typically lighter and CPMs lower outside major metros.

To hit $40 CAC, you'll need approximately 40% efficiency improvement. Based on your current $65-70 performance, this is achievable through:
- Geographic arbitrage (secondary markets typically 20-30% cheaper)
- Funnel optimization (you mentioned improvements in progress)
- Tighter audience targeting to reduce waste

Your $850 LTV gives you solid cushion even if you land at $50-55 CAC, maintaining healthy 15-17x ratios.

Before we dive into audience targeting to help achieve this efficiency, what's your typical sales cycle from first transaction to reaching full LTV? This affects how we should structure the campaign timeline and measurement windows.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent, that's a much stronger success metric. Now let me check your efficiency targets.

$2M budget ÷ 50,000 merchants = $40 per merchant acquisition. With your $850 LTV, that projects to a 21.3x LTV/CAC ratio, which is extremely healthy for B2B fintech.

However, this efficiency is quite aggressive for merchant acquisition. Based on fintech benchmarks, typical merchant CACs range from $75-$150 depending on merchant size and vertical. Your $40 target suggests you'll need very tight audience definition and high-performing channels.

Is this $40 CAC based on historical performance, or is this a stretch target you're setting to maximize volume within budget?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Perfect - that 90-day quality checkpoint is smart given the early churn pattern. Your economics look solid for hitting the $40 CAC target with geographic expansion and optimization.

Now let's define your target audience to maximize efficiency. You mentioned small businesses processing $10K-$100K monthly. 

What specific business characteristics beyond processing volume help you identify your best merchants? For example, are there particular industries, business ages, employee counts, or other signals that correlate with higher LTV and faster activation?

Turn 6:
Excellent targeting intelligence. Service businesses with 2-5 years in business and 5-25 employees in professional verticals - that's a well-defined audience that should help hit your efficiency targets.

Let me add a few more signals to sharpen the definition. For the $10K-$100K monthly processing volume, do you have insights on:

1. Current payment processor signals that indicate switching intent or dissatisfaction?
2. Technology adoption patterns - are there business tools or software usage signals that correlate with your best merchants?

These behavioral signals often provide the efficiency edge needed to move from $65 to $40 CAC.

Turn 7:
Perfect audience definition. You've identified clear behavioral and technographic signals that should drive significant efficiency gains:

**Target Audience Summary:**
- Service businesses: consulting, agencies, SaaS, professional services, healthcare, legal
- 2-5 years in business, 5-25 employees  
- $10K-$100K monthly processing volume
- Using legacy processors or basic solutions (Square/Stripe)
- Recently funded or scaling businesses
- Tech-forward: HubSpot, Salesforce, QuickBooks users
- Subscription/recurring revenue models

This precision targeting should help bridge your efficiency gap from $65 to $40 CAC.

Now let's define your geography strategy. You mentioned expanding beyond major metros into secondary markets for cost efficiency. Which specific markets are you currently strong in, and which secondary markets are you considering for expansion?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Smart geographic strategy. Those secondary markets should deliver the cost efficiency you need while maintaining volume.

**Primary Markets (Established):** NYC, SF, LA, Chicago, Boston, Seattle - higher CPMs but proven performance
**Secondary Expansion:** Austin, Denver, Nashville, Raleigh-Durham, Salt Lake City - growing tech scenes, lower competition
**Tertiary Opportunities:** Portland, Kansas City, Columbus - cost-efficient with solid SMB density

The 20-30% efficiency improvement in secondary markets could be the key to hitting your $40 CAC target. Combined with your tight audience definition, this geographic arbitrage should help bridge the gap from your current $65-70 performance.

Your $2M budget across these markets targeting 50,000 merchants is mathematically challenging but strategically sound. The audience precision and geographic expansion create a realistic path to efficiency gains.

What percentage of your total budget are you thinking of allocating to these secondary and tertiary markets versus maintaining presence in your established primary markets?

Turn 9:
Excellent allocation strategy. Let me model this out:

**Budget Allocation:**
- Primary markets: $1.2M (60%) - established volume, higher CPMs
- Secondary markets: $600K (30%) - efficiency focus with growth potential  
- Tertiary markets: $200K (10%) - testing and validation

This projects to roughly:
- Primary: 24,000 merchants at ~$50 CAC (higher than target but volume critical)
- Secondary: 15,000 merchants at ~$40 CAC (hitting efficiency target)
- Tertiary: 5,000 merchants at ~$40 CAC (if tests validate)

The weighted average gets you close to your $40 overall target while maintaining volume from established markets.

Your Q2/Q3 reallocation plan is smart - performance data from secondary markets will inform optimization.

Now let's develop your value proposition framework. With your sophisticated audience and competitive landscape, what key differentiators resonate most with prospects during the consideration phase? What typically tips the decision in your favor over legacy processors or basic solutions?

Turn 10:
Strong value proposition with clear competitive advantages. Your messaging framework should emphasize:

**Primary Value Drivers:**
- API flexibility: "Seamlessly integrates with your existing tech stack"
- Transparent pricing: "Flat-rate, no hidden fees" 
- Cash flow advantage: "Same-day settlement vs 2-3 day holds"
- Cost savings: "15-20% processing cost reduction"

This positioning directly addresses the pain points of your target audience - tech-forward service businesses frustrated with legacy limitations.

Your value prop aligns perfectly with the audience signals we defined: businesses using HubSpot/Salesforce/QuickBooks who need integration, cost-conscious 2-5 year companies wanting pricing transparency, and scaling businesses needing better cash flow.

Now let's build your channel strategy. With $2M budget, tight efficiency targets, and this value proposition, which channels are you currently using and which new ones are you considering for this expansion plan?
