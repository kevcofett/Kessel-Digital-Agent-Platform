# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience Unified Media Plan

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've provided excellent segment detail - that will be crucial for Step 3. First, let's establish your foundation.

$3M budget targeting 25,000 enrollees projects to $120 per acquisition across all segments. That's efficient for insurance if your unit economics support it.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve beyond enrollment numbers? For example, are you focused on total premium revenue, long-term customer value, or market share in specific regions?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your primary objective is premium revenue growth through high-LTV enrollees, with a secondary focus on market share expansion in suburban family markets.

For your primary KPI, what's most important to track - total premium revenue from new enrollees, or average premium value per enrollee? And do you have a specific revenue target for these 25,000 new customers?

Understanding this helps us weight the segments properly, since your pre-Medicare segment likely commands much higher premiums than young professionals.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Perfect. 85% retention over 4-5 years with annual premium increases creates excellent LTV fundamentals. 

Let me model this: $650 average premium × 4.5 years × 85% retention ≈ $2,500+ LTV per customer. At $120 acquisition cost, that projects to roughly 20:1 LTV/CAC ratio - very healthy economics.

The segment variation is key insight. Pre-Medicare likely delivers $3,000+ LTV with high retention, while young professionals might be $1,500-2,000 LTV with higher churn risk.

This suggests we can afford higher acquisition costs for pre-Medicare and families versus young professionals. Your $120 blended target is definitely achievable.

Now let's dive deeper into those three segments. Starting with Young Professionals - beyond the demographics you mentioned, what behavioral signals or life events make someone most likely to enroll? Job changes, moving cities, aging off parents' plans?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent. $15-18M annual premium revenue from 25,000 enrollees equals $600-720 average premium per customer. That's strong unit economics for insurance.

$3M acquisition cost / $15-18M annual premium = 17-20% of first-year revenue for acquisition. That's aggressive but achievable if your LTV extends multiple years.

Quick reality check: What's your typical customer retention rate and average customer lifespan? For example, if customers stay 3+ years, your acquisition efficiency looks very healthy. If it's closer to 1-2 years, we'll need tighter targeting to hit those economics.

This determines how much we can afford to spend per segment while maintaining profitability.

Turn 6:
Perfect. Tech hubs with $50K-$100K earners who value convenience - that's a well-defined segment.

Now for Families: You mentioned parents with kids under 18 in suburban markets. What specific concerns or trigger events drive family enrollment decisions? Is it birth of a child, dissatisfaction with current coverage, or something else?

And for the suburban targeting around top 50 metros - are you thinking the immediate suburbs, or extending further out to exurban areas where families might relocate for more space?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Excellent behavioral insights. Those life transition moments create urgency and openness to switching.

For targeting precision: Are there specific job industries or income ranges that perform best for young professionals? For example, do tech workers, consultants, or gig economy workers convert better than others?

And geographically, you mentioned NYC, SF, LA, Chicago - are there other metros that work well for this segment, or should we focus tightly on those four major markets?

Turn 8:
Perfect. That completes our audience foundation - three distinct segments with clear triggers and geographic patterns.

Now let's map your geography strategy. You've identified:
- Young Professionals: 7 urban metros (NYC, SF, LA, Chicago, Seattle, Austin, Denver)
- Families: Suburban markets around top 50 metros
- Pre-Medicare: National with concentration in FL, AZ, TX

For the family suburban targeting, which specific metro areas are your top priorities? We need to define the core markets to properly size your target audience and allocate your $3M budget.

Are you thinking the top 10-15 metro suburbs, or casting wider to all 50?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Excellent. Child-related life events and cost predictability for multi-member coverage - those are powerful motivators.

Finally, Pre-Medicare segment: Beyond approaching retirement, what specific concerns drive enrollment for 55-64 year-olds? Is it employer plan changes, early retirement, or concerns about healthcare gaps before Medicare kicks in?

And for the geographic concentration in FL, AZ, TX - are these retirees who've already relocated, or people planning retirement moves to those states?

Turn 9:
Smart approach. Focused presence in 15-20 metro suburbs beats thin coverage across 50 markets.

Now let's structure your $3M budget allocation. Given your LTV insights - pre-Medicare delivering highest value, families representing volume growth opportunity, and young professionals having lower LTV but good efficiency - how are you thinking about budget weighting across the three segments?

For example, are you leaning toward equal thirds ($1M each), or do you want to weight toward the higher-value segments? Your 25,000 enrollment target suggests roughly 8,300 per segment if split evenly.

Turn 10:
Let me check that math: $1.2M / 10,000 families = $120 per family acquisition, $1.2M / 8,000 pre-Medicare = $150 per pre-Medicare, and $600K / 7,000 young professionals = $86 per young professional.

That allocation is strategically sound. You're investing more in pre-Medicare ($150 CAC) where you can afford it given their $3,000+ LTV, while keeping young professionals lean at $86 CAC to match their lower LTV.

The $120 family CAC balances volume goals with your growth market investment. All three efficiency targets look achievable for insurance.

Now let's develop your value propositions. For young professionals who prioritize convenience and digital experience, what's your core message? Is it ease of enrollment, mobile access, or specific benefits that resonate?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 11:
Excellent positioning. "Healthcare that fits your life" with mobile-first tools and transparent pricing speaks directly to their digital-native, convenience-focused mindset.

For families, what's your core value proposition? Given their focus on comprehensive coverage and cost predictability for multiple family members, how do you frame your benefits differently than the young professional message?

Turn 12:
Perfect. "Comprehensive protection you can count on" with family care coordination and real customer service - that addresses their complexity and peace-of-mind needs.

For pre-Medicare, what's your value proposition? Given their focus on stability and transition planning, how do you position your benefits for this life stage?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 13:
Excellent. "Secure coverage for your transition years" with Medicare planning support and provider continuity - that directly addresses their stability concerns and transition anxiety.

Now we move to channels. Given your three distinct segments, different geographies, and varying LTV targets, let's build your media mix.

Starting with young professionals in urban metros: They're digital-first with $86 CAC target. What channels are you currently using or considering for this segment? Paid social, search, programmatic display, or others?

The key is matching channels to their research behavior and preferred touchpoints.

Turn 14:
Smart channel selection. Digital channels align perfectly with their behavior and your $86 efficiency target.

For families in suburban markets: They need human touchpoints and comprehensive information for family decisions. Are you considering different channels than young professionals? For example, local digital, connected TV for household reach, or search focused on family-specific terms?

The $120 CAC target gives you more flexibility, and suburban targeting might require broader reach channels.
