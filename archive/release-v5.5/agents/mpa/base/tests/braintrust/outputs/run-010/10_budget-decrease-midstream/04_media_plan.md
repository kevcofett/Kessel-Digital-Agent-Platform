# Media Plan Output: Budget Decrease Midstream

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

$1M ÷ 500 opportunities = $2,000 per qualified opportunity. That's a solid efficiency target for enterprise software with your deal size.

Your business outcome is clear - generate qualified opportunities. How do you define "qualified opportunity" specifically? Is it MQL, SQL, or a specific scoring threshold?

Turn 2:
Perfect - SQLs with validated BANT criteria is a strong qualification standard for enterprise sales. That $2,000 cost per SQL is aggressive but achievable for your deal size.

At $150K average deal value, even a 10% close rate would yield $15K revenue per SQL, giving you a healthy 7.5x return. Enterprise data infrastructure typically sees 15-25% SQL-to-close rates based on industry benchmarks.

What close rate are you modeling from SQL to closed-won? This will help us validate if the $2,000 efficiency target aligns with your unit economics.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - 15% close rate gives you $22.5K revenue per SQL, making your $2,000 target very healthy at 11x return. With 40-50% expansion, the lifetime value is even stronger.

$1M budget ÷ 500 SQLs = $2,000 per SQL is definitely achievable for enterprise software, though it will require precise targeting and efficient channels. Based on enterprise data infrastructure benchmarks, this sits in the "tight but realistic" range - you'll need strong audience definition and channel efficiency to hit it consistently.

Perfect - we've established solid economics. Now let's define your audience precisely. You mentioned 5000+ employees targeting data and IT leaders. Which specific titles are you prioritizing - Chief Data Officer, VP of Data Engineering, IT Director, or others?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Excellent targeting strategy - VP/Director level gives you that perfect balance of technical understanding and budget influence. Principal Data Engineers at tech companies is a smart addition given their outsized influence in flatter orgs.

So we're targeting:
- VP of Data Engineering  
- Director of Data Architecture
- VP of IT Infrastructure
- CDO (when reachable)
- Principal Data Engineers (especially at tech companies)

All at companies 5000+ employees. 

What geographic focus do you have? Are you targeting specific regions, or is this a national campaign? Also, do you have any industry verticals that convert particularly well for your data infrastructure solutions?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Perfect - US (70%), UK, and Germany with strong vertical focus. Financial services, retail, and tech companies are smart priorities given their data complexity and your proven performance there.

So your core audience is:
- VP/Director level data and IT leaders + Principal Data Engineers
- 5000+ employee companies  
- Financial services, retail, and tech verticals
- US (70% budget), UK, Germany

At $2,000 per SQL targeting this precise audience, you'll need tight channel efficiency. Enterprise audiences of this seniority typically require multiple touchpoints and longer nurture cycles.

Now for budget allocation - you mentioned $700K for US and $300K split between UK and Germany. How are you thinking about the UK/Germany split, and do you have different efficiency expectations by region?

Turn 6:
That allocation makes perfect sense - $700K US, $180K UK, $120K Germany. Your efficiency expectations are spot-on based on market maturity.

Modeling your targets:
- US: $700K ÷ $2,000 = 350 SQLs
- UK: $180K ÷ $2,000 = 90 SQLs  
- Germany: $120K ÷ $2,600 (30% higher) = ~46 SQLs
- Total: ~486 SQLs (close to your 500 target)

The German premium for localization and brand building is realistic. UK efficiency matching US makes sense given your established presence.

Now let's nail your value proposition. With enterprise data infrastructure, what's your core differentiation that resonates most with these VP/Director level buyers? Is it performance, cost efficiency, ease of implementation, or something else that drives their evaluation?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 7:
"One platform, infinite scale" - that's a compelling value prop that hits both technical and business pain points. Eliminating vendor sprawl while delivering 3-5x performance gains gives you strong ROI messaging for budget-conscious VPs.

Your unified orchestration story should resonate well across all three geos, especially in financial services where regulatory compliance makes vendor management critical.

Perfect - we've got solid economics ($2,000 per SQL), precise audience (VP/Director level at 5000+ employee companies), clear geography (US/UK/Germany), realistic budget allocation, and strong value proposition around platform consolidation.

Now for channels. Given your enterprise audience and complex sale, what channels are you currently using, and which have driven your best SQL quality? This will help us optimize your mix for next year.

Turn 8:
LinkedIn at 40% makes perfect sense for your enterprise audience - the targeting precision for VP/Director level is unmatched, and ABM campaigns align perfectly with your high-value, long-cycle sales process.

Based on your $2,000 per SQL target and proven channels, I'd recommend this allocation:

**LinkedIn (45% - $450K)**: Increase investment in what's working. Scale ABM and add LinkedIn Events for webinar promotion.

**Programmatic Display (25% - $250K)**: Expand beyond retargeting to include prospecting on B2B tech sites and industry publications.

**Search (20% - $200K)**: Capture intent with branded and competitor terms, plus high-intent keywords like "data orchestration platform."

**Events/Content (10% - $100K)**: Trade shows, webinars, and sponsored content on industry sites.

This mix prioritizes proven performance while adding search to capture active evaluation behavior. The 45% LinkedIn allocation gives you scale while maintaining efficiency.

How does this channel allocation align with your current performance data and comfort level?
