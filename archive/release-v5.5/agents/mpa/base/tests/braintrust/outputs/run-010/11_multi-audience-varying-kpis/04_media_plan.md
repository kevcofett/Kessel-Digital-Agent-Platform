# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience with Different KPIs Per Segment

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! This is a sophisticated multi-objective challenge - exactly the type that benefits from our structured approach. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've outlined three distinct business outcomes with different success definitions. Let me clarify the primary KPIs for each segment:

**Segment 1 (Conquest)**: You mentioned "brand lift" - are you measuring this through aided/unaided brand awareness surveys, or do you have a different brand lift methodology?

**Segment 2 (In-Market)**: VDP views, form fills, calls, test drives - which of these is your primary success metric? They have very different economics.

**Segment 3 (Loyalty)**: Service appointments, trade-in inquiries, lease renewals - again, which drives the most business value?

I need to understand your primary KPI hierarchy before we can model realistic efficiency targets across your $4.5M budget.

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your primary KPIs are:
- **Conquest**: Reach/frequency with quarterly consideration tracking
- **In-Market**: Test drive appointments (qualified leads)
- **Loyalty**: Service appointments (with trade-in inquiries as secondary)

Now for volume targets. With $4.5M allocated as 35%/45%/20% ($1.575M/$2.025M/$900K):

**In-Market** is easiest to quantify - how many test drive appointments do you need to generate with that $2.025M? Your BDC should have solid conversion data from test drives to sales.

Once I have that target, I can work backwards to model if your implied cost-per-test-drive is achievable based on automotive benchmarks.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it. I'll model using automotive benchmarks and you can refine anytime.

Based on automotive industry data, cost-per-test-drive typically ranges $150-$300 depending on market competitiveness and brand positioning. For multi-brand dealership groups, $200-$250 is common.

Let me run the math on your range:

**Conservative scenario**: $2.025M ÷ $250 = 8,100 test drives annually
**Your target range**: 3,000-4,000 test drives = $506-$675 per test drive
**Aggressive scenario**: $2.025M ÷ $150 = 13,500 test drives annually

Your 3,000-4,000 target implies $506-$675 per test drive, which is significantly above market benchmarks. At 35-40% conversion, you're looking at roughly $1,400-$1,900 cost per sale just in media spend.

This suggests either: 1) Your market has unique challenges requiring premium acquisition costs, or 2) The target may be conservative relative to budget capacity.

What's your average gross profit per vehicle sale? That will help us assess if these economics work for your business.

Turn 4:
Excellent - 7,000-8,000 test drives annually is much more aligned with your budget capacity. 

$2.025M ÷ 7,500 test drives = $270 per test drive, which hits the sweet spot of automotive benchmarks. At 35% conversion and $3,750 average gross profit, you're looking at $771 media cost per sale with $2,979 remaining gross profit - very healthy unit economics.

Now let's assess your other segments. For **Conquest ($1.575M)**, reach/frequency campaigns typically run $8-$15 CPM in automotive. At $12 CPM, that's approximately 131 million impressions annually.

For **Loyalty ($900K)**, existing customer targeting is much more efficient - often $50-$150 per service appointment depending on your database quality and recency.

At $100 per service appointment, your $900K projects to 9,000 service appointments annually. Does that volume align with your service bay capacity and current customer base size?

Turn 5:
Perfect - 9,000 service appointments at $100 each gives you strong efficiency leveraging your existing customer data.

You're absolutely right about timing being critical. CRM-driven campaigns with service due dates and trade-in cycle triggers typically achieve $50-$80 per appointment, so $100 is conservative and accounts for some broader loyalty messaging.

Now that we have realistic efficiency targets across all three segments:
- **Conquest**: 131M impressions at $12 CPM
- **In-Market**: 7,500 test drives at $270 each  
- **Loyalty**: 9,000 service appointments at $100 each

These economics look achievable based on automotive benchmarks. Next, we need to define your target audiences for each segment. 

Starting with **Conquest** - when you target competitor vehicle owners, are you focusing on specific competitive brands, or casting a wider net across all non-Velocity drivers in your market areas?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 7:
Excellent approach - cross-shopping behavior is strong in automotive, especially in those core categories. Active research signals like third-party site visits and financing inquiries typically convert 2-3x higher than cold audiences.

For **Loyalty**, you mentioned using your customer database with service timing and trade-in cycles. How many total customers do you have across all three brands and 12 locations? This helps determine if your 9,000 service appointment target represents reasonable penetration of your existing base.

Also, are you segmenting loyalty outreach by recency - recent buyers vs. customers from 3-4 years ago approaching trade-in windows?

Turn 8:
Perfect - 20% penetration of your 45K customer base is realistic, and your lifecycle segmentation approach is sophisticated. That database with 8 years of purchase/service history gives you strong targeting precision.

Now let's define geography. With 12 dealerships across multiple locations, are you planning to allocate budget proportionally across all markets, or do you have specific dealerships/markets that are priorities for growth?

Also, what's the geographic spread - are these clustered in one metro area, or distributed across different DMAs/regions?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Smart targeting - focusing on comparable brand owners in that 2-4 year ownership window maximizes relevance and minimizes waste.

Third-party automotive data providers typically achieve 60-75% accuracy on vehicle ownership and purchase timing. At 70% accuracy, your 131M impressions would reach approximately 92M qualified households multiple times throughout the year.

For **In-Market**, active vehicle shoppers have much stronger behavioral signals - website visits, dealer lot visits, financing inquiries. Are you primarily targeting people showing research behavior for your specific brands, or casting wider to capture cross-shoppers researching multiple brands including yours?

The targeting approach affects both reach and conversion rates significantly.

Turn 9:
Excellent geographic strategy - weighting toward growth markets while maintaining established locations makes strong business sense.

The segment-specific geo approach is smart: broader conquest reach for awareness, tight radius for in-market to drive showroom traffic, and database-driven loyalty without geo constraints.

Now for budget allocation. You've established your segment split (35%/45%/20%), but within that $4.5M total, how do you want to weight between your established primary market versus the growth markets?

For context: Growth markets typically need 1.5-2x the per-location investment of established markets to build awareness and consideration. Are you thinking roughly 60% to growth markets and 40% to established, or a different split?

Turn 10:
Smart allocation - 65% to growth markets with segment rebalancing makes perfect strategic sense.

Let me model this:

**Growth Markets (65% = $2.925M)**
- Conquest: 50% = $1.463M 
- In-Market: 35% = $1.024M
- Loyalty: 15% = $439M

**Established Market (35% = $1.575M)**  
- Conquest: 20% = $315M
- In-Market: 55% = $866M  
- Loyalty: 25% = $394M

This projects to approximately:
- Growth markets: 117M conquest impressions, 3,800 test drives, 4,400 service appointments
- Established market: 26M conquest impressions, 3,200 test drives, 3,900 service appointments

Does this allocation feel right for driving expansion while maintaining your strong primary market position?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 11:
Excellent - you're seeing how the math supports your strategic priorities. The $270 per test drive consistency across markets validates the allocation.

Now for value proposition. Each segment needs different messaging:

**Conquest** needs to shift consideration from competitor brands - typically competitive advantages, incentives, or brand differentiators that give people a reason to consider you over their current brand loyalty.

**In-Market** needs conversion-focused messaging - inventory, pricing, financing offers, immediate reasons to visit your showroom over competitors.

**Loyalty** needs retention messaging - service value, trade-in advantages, loyalty benefits.

What are your key competitive advantages that would make a Ford owner consider switching to your Toyota/Honda/Nissan lineup? This drives your conquest messaging framework.

Turn 12:
Perfect - leading with rational benefits backed by third-party validation is smart positioning against emotional brand loyalty. "Stop overpaying for repairs and losing money on depreciation" is a compelling value proposition that directly addresses the pain points of current domestic brand owners.

For **In-Market**, you'll need more immediate conversion drivers. What's your competitive advantage for active shoppers who are comparing you against other Toyota/Honda/Nissan dealers in your markets? Is it inventory availability, pricing, financing terms, or service experience?

This shapes whether your in-market messaging leads with "largest selection," "best prices," "fastest financing," or "superior service experience."

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 13:
Excellent differentiation - "find it today, drive it today" directly addresses the biggest pain points in automotive retail: inventory availability and financing delays. Multi-brand inventory across 12 locations plus sub-30-minute approvals is a strong competitive moat.

For **Loyalty**, what's your retention value proposition? Is it service convenience across multiple locations, loyalty pricing, trade-in advantages, or something else that keeps customers in your ecosystem rather than going to independent shops or other dealers?

This completes your value proposition framework before we move to channel selection.

Turn 14:
Perfect value proposition framework:
- **Conquest**: "Stop overpaying for repairs and losing money on depreciation" (rational, data-backed)
- **In-Market**: "Find it today, drive it today" (immediate availability + speed)
- **Loyalty**: "We know your car, we know you" (relationship + convenience)

Now for channels. With your three distinct objectives and audiences, each segment needs different channel strategies:

**Conquest** (awareness/reach): Needs channels that efficiently deliver broad reach to competitor vehicle owners. Think upper-funnel channels that can target automotive data segments.

**In-Market** (test drives): Needs channels that capture active shopping behavior and drive immediate action.

**Loyalty** (service appointments): Needs channels that leverage your customer database for precise targeting.

Starting with **Conquest** - what channels are you currently considering for reaching competitor brand owners with your reliability/value messaging? Are you thinking traditional (radio, TV) or more targeted digital approaches?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 17:
Perfect loyalty channel mix leveraging your CRM capabilities and lifecycle segmentation.

**Loyalty Budget Allocation** across your $833K total:
- Email/CRM: 40% = $333K (automated workflows, personalized campaigns)
- Retargeting: 30% = $250K (lifecycle-triggered digital messaging) 
- Direct mail: 20% = $167K (high-value segments, major milestones)
- SMS: 10% = $83K (time-sensitive, appointment-focused)

Now for measurement. Each segment needs different success metrics:

**Conquest**: Reach/frequency plus quarterly consideration tracking
**In-Market**: Test drive appointments (your BDC tracks this)
**Loyalty**: Service appointments + trade-in inquiries

The challenge is attribution across multiple touchpoints. A customer might see conquest TV, later search for your dealership, then convert via retargeting. How are you planning to track and attribute these multi-touch journeys, especially for conquest-to-conversion paths that span months?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 15:
Excellent channel strategy for conquest - TV/CTV for broad reach plus precision digital targeting creates effective reach and frequency against competitor owners.

For **In-Market** (test drives), you need channels that capture active shopping behavior. Based on your cross-shopping strategy, I'm thinking:

- **Search** (Google, Bing) for immediate intent capture when people search for specific models
- **Social** (Meta, potentially TikTok) with lookalike audiences based on recent buyers
- **Automotive sites** (Autotrader, Cars.com, CarGurus) where your prospects are actively researching
- **YouTube** for shopping-phase video content

Which of these aligns best with where your BDC sees the highest-quality leads currently coming from? That data should guide budget allocation within your $1.024M in-market spend for growth markets.

Turn 16:
Smart allocation based on your BDC's lead quality data. Search and auto sites delivering your highest-converting traffic should definitely get the lion's share.

**In-Market Budget Allocation:**
- Search: 50% = $512K (growth) + $433K (established) = $945K total
- Auto sites: 30% = $307K (growth) + $260K (established) = $567K total  
- Social: 20% = $205K (growth) + $173K (established) = $378K total

For **Loyalty** (service appointments), you have that robust 45K customer database. Are you planning to use:

- **Email/CRM** for service reminders and trade-in outreach
- **Direct mail** for higher-impact messaging to high-value segments
- **Retargeting** to reach customers digitally when they're online
- **SMS** for time-sensitive service reminders

Which channels does your current CRM system support, and where do you see the best engagement rates from your existing customer base?
