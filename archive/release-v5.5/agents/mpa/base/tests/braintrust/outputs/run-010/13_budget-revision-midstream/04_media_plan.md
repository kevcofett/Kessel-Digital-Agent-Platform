# Media Plan Output: Budget Revision Midstream

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your economics since you've provided great detail. $500K / 10,000 = $50 per customer acquisition cost. With $2,400 LTV, that's a 48x LTV/CAC ratio - exceptionally strong unit economics that gives you significant flexibility.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 10,000 new customers? For example, are you focused on revenue growth, market expansion, or hitting a particular ARR milestone?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your primary objective is revenue growth to $15M ARR, with market expansion as a secondary benefit. Your primary KPI is new customer acquisitions - those 10,000 customers at your current pricing model.

Let me validate the efficiency target. At $50 CAC with $2,400 LTV, you have exceptional unit economics that are highly achievable for B2B SaaS. Industry benchmarks typically show $200-800 CAC for analytics SaaS, so your target is very conservative and gives you room for premium channels and high-quality acquisition.

This efficiency suggests we can focus on quality over volume and invest in channels that reach decision-makers effectively, even at higher CPMs. Your strong unit economics also allow for longer consideration windows typical in B2B sales cycles.

Now let's define your audience. Who is the ideal customer within your target companies? Are you selling to data analysts, marketing directors, C-suite executives, or a mix of decision-makers?

Turn 4:
Perfect. Mid-market (100-1000 employees) with strong traction in e-commerce, retail, manufacturing, healthcare, and fintech. The compliance considerations in healthcare and fintech are important for messaging and channel selection.

Two quick clarifications on audience sizing: 

First, within those 100-1000 employee companies, are you targeting businesses of any revenue size, or do you focus on companies hitting certain revenue thresholds?

Second, geographically, are you targeting specific regions? For example, are you focused on North America, or do you have international expansion plans that would affect this 10,000 customer target?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Excellent - a dual-audience approach with analysts as influencers and C-suite as final decision-makers. This is common in B2B SaaS and affects both messaging and channel strategy.

For the analysts and BI managers who do initial research, what size companies are you targeting? Are you focused on mid-market companies with specific employee counts or revenue ranges? And within those companies, are there particular industries or verticals where your analytics platform performs especially well?

Turn 5:
Excellent - companies with $10M+ revenue in the US and Canada. That gives us a well-defined target market.

Let me model your target audience size. Based on your criteria:
- Mid-market companies (100-1000 employees)  
- $10M+ annual revenue
- Strong fit verticals: e-commerce, retail, manufacturing, healthcare, fintech
- Geography: US and Canada

This suggests approximately 150,000-200,000 companies in your total addressable market across North America. Your 10,000 target represents about 5-7% market penetration, which is aggressive but achievable given your strong unit economics.

Now for geography planning - do you want to focus on specific regions within the US and Canada, or are you planning national coverage? For example, are there particular metro areas or regions where your current customer base is concentrated?

Turn 6:
Smart approach - national coverage with concentration in proven markets leverages your referral momentum. Let me structure your geography plan:

**GEOGRAPHY PLAN - DMA LEVEL**

| DMA Name | Total Population | Target Companies | Concentration Level |
|----------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose | 7.8M | 12,500 | High |
| Seattle-Tacoma | 4.0M | 6,200 | High |
| Austin | 2.4M | 3,800 | High |
| Toronto | 6.2M | 8,900 | High |
| Atlanta | 5.9M | 8,100 | High |
| Denver | 3.1M | 4,700 | High |
| Remaining US Markets | 285M | 98,000 | Standard |
| Remaining Canada Markets | 32M | 6,800 | Standard |
| **TOTAL** | **346M** | **149,000** | **Mixed** |

Your high-concentration markets represent about 30% of your target companies but likely 50%+ of your near-term conversion potential due to existing momentum.

Now let's establish your budget framework. With $500K total and this geography mix, are you thinking of allocating budget proportionally by market size, or would you weight more heavily toward your high-concentration markets?

Turn 7:
Excellent strategic thinking - concentrating 60-70% of budget in high-momentum markets maximizes your referral network effects and market penetration where you're already resonating.

Let me model this allocation:

**BUDGET ALLOCATION BY MARKET CONCENTRATION**

| Market Type | Budget Allocation | Total Spend | Target Companies | Spend Per Target |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| High-Concentration Markets | 65% | $325,000 | 44,100 | $7.37 |
| Standard Coverage Markets | 35% | $175,000 | 104,900 | $1.67 |
| **TOTAL** | **100%** | **$500,000** | **149,000** | **$3.36** |

This gives you 4.4x higher spend per target company in your proven markets while maintaining national presence. At $50 target CAC, this projects to approximately 6,500 customers from high-concentration markets and 3,500 from standard markets.

Now let's define your value proposition. Given your dual audience of analysts who research and executives who approve, how do you position CloudMetrics differently? What's your core value proposition that resonates with both user and buyer?

Turn 8:
Perfect positioning - "analytics without the complexity" hits both audiences effectively. The 90-day ROI story is compelling for executives, while the quick implementation appeals to analysts who've likely experienced painful enterprise rollouts.

Your value proposition creates clear messaging hierarchy:
- **Primary**: Enterprise insights without enterprise complexity
- **For Analysts**: Week 1 productivity vs. quarter 1 frustration  
- **For Executives**: 90-day measurable ROI and faster decision cycles
- **Differentiator**: Sweet spot between limited tools and over-engineered platforms

This positions you perfectly for the mid-market gap and supports your geographic concentration strategy since these pain points are universal in growing companies.

Now let's move to channel strategy. Given your dual audience, proven markets, and value proposition, which channels are you currently using or considering? For example, are you thinking about LinkedIn for reaching executives, Google for analysts doing research, industry publications, or other approaches?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Excellent foundation to build on. Given your $50 CAC target, dual audience, and proven markets, here's my recommended channel mix:

**RECOMMENDED CHANNEL ALLOCATION**

| Channel | Budget % | Monthly Spend | Primary Audience | Rationale |
|---------|----------|---------------|------------------|-----------|
| LinkedIn Ads | 40% | $16,667 | Both audiences | Best B2B targeting, dual messaging |
| Google Search | 30% | $12,500 | Analysts (research) | High-intent, bottom-funnel |
| Programmatic Display | 20% | $8,333 | Executives | Retargeting + account-based |
| Content Syndication | 10% | $4,167 | Both audiences | Amplify existing assets |

**Why this mix works for $50 CAC:**
- LinkedIn: $30-60 B2B CAC typical, perfect for your economics
- Google Search: $20-40 CAC for SaaS keywords
- Display: $40-80 CAC but excellent for executive reach
- Content: $25-50 CAC, leverages your existing assets

**Geographic execution:** Start with 70% in your high-concentration DMAs, 30% national.

The key is LinkedIn's dual-audience capability - you can run separate campaigns for analysts vs. executives with tailored messaging while maintaining efficient targeting.

Which of these channels feels most aligned with where you want to start, or do you have concerns about any of them?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Great questions! Let me break down both channels for your B2B context:

**CONTENT SYNDICATION**
This amplifies your existing case studies and whitepapers through B2B publisher networks like TechTarget, Demand Gen Report, or industry publications. 

How it works: Your content gets promoted to targeted audiences (analysts/executives at mid-market companies), and you pay per qualified download or engagement. The leads come pre-qualified since they actively consumed your content.

For CloudMetrics: Your manufacturing case study gets syndicated to operations managers at $10M+ manufacturing companies in your target DMAs. CAC typically runs $25-50 because the leads are highly qualified.

**PROGRAMMATIC DISPLAY**
This is sophisticated banner/video advertising that can drive both awareness and conversions.

Two approaches for you:
1. **Account-Based Display**: Target specific companies in your prospect list with executive-focused messaging
2. **Retargeting**: Re-engage website visitors who viewed pricing or demo pages

At $40-80 CAC, it works because you're reaching decision-makers who are harder to find elsewhere. A CTO who sees your "90-day ROI" message across business publications is more likely to take that demo call.

Both channels complement LinkedIn beautifully - content syndication feeds your funnel, display reinforces your message.

Does this help clarify how they'd fit your strategy?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 11:
Great question on timing! I'd recommend a phased approach to ensure proper optimization and learning:

**RECOMMENDED LAUNCH SEQUENCE**

**Month 1-2: Foundation**
- LinkedIn Ads (both analyst and executive campaigns)
- Google Search (high-intent keywords)
- Start: 70% of total budget

**Month 3-4: Expansion** 
- Add Content Syndication (leverage existing assets)
- Increase to 85% of budget

**Month 5-6: Full Mix**
- Launch Programmatic Display (account-based + retargeting)
- Scale to full 100% budget

**Why this sequence works:**
- LinkedIn + Google give immediate feedback on messaging and targeting
- Content syndication builds on early learnings about which assets resonate
- Display requires the most setup (prospect lists, creative development) and works better with retargeting pools from earlier channels

**Timeline expectations:**
- LinkedIn: 2-3 weeks setup
- Google: 1-2 weeks setup  
- Content Syndication: 3-4 weeks (asset optimization)
- Programmatic: 4-6 weeks (account lists, creative, tracking)

This approach lets you optimize each channel before adding complexity, and ensures your retargeting has sufficient traffic volume.

Now let's talk measurement. What's your current tracking setup, and how do you plan to measure success across these channels?
