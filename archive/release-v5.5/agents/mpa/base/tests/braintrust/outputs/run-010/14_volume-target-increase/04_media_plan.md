# Media Plan Output: Volume Target Increase

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've given me great foundational data - $400K budget for 5,000 customers with $320 LTV. Let me start with your business outcome.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 5,000 new customers? For example, are you focused on revenue growth, market expansion, or something else?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect! Revenue growth through customer acquisition is your primary objective. Now let me check if your efficiency target is realistic.

$400K ÷ 5,000 customers = $80 per customer acquisition cost. With your $320 LTV, that's a 4x LTV/CAC ratio, which is excellent for sustainable growth in e-commerce.

Based on home goods benchmarks, $80 CAC is achievable but will require focused targeting. Most home décor brands see $60-120 CAC depending on product mix and audience precision.

How do you currently measure success? Is it total new customers acquired, or do you track a specific revenue metric as your primary KPI?

Turn 3:
Excellent - you have strong historical performance to build on. Your $75-85 CAC track record validates the $80 target, and 3:1 first-month ROAS shows healthy unit economics.

One quick note on ROAS: platform-reported ROAS can inflate due to attribution overlap. For primary measurement, I'd recommend focusing on your customer count and 90-day revenue metrics since those reflect true incrementality.

Your economics look solid for Step 2. We have:
- Primary KPI: 5,000 new customers acquired  
- Target efficiency: $80 CAC (realistic based on your history)
- Strong unit economics: 4x LTV/CAC ratio

Ready to move to Step 3 and define your target audience? Who is your ideal customer for these home goods?

Turn 4:
Great audience foundation! Homeowners 30-55 with home décor interest gives us a solid starting point. Let me dig deeper to sharpen your targeting.

Within that 30-55 homeowner group, are there specific life stage triggers that drive purchases? For example, do you see more success with recent home buyers, people renovating, empty nesters redecorating, or is it more evenly distributed across different motivations?

Understanding the "why now" moment helps us identify the highest-intent segments within your broader audience.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Perfect! Those behavioral triggers give us much stronger targeting precision. Let me map your audience segments:

**Primary Segments:**
- Recent home buyers (30-45, within 6-12 months of purchase)
- Active renovators (40-55, room-by-room updates)  
- Recent movers (30-55, regardless of ownership timeline)

**Secondary Segment:**
- Empty nesters (45-55+, price-sensitive, longer conversion cycle)

This targeting should significantly improve your $80 CAC efficiency since you're focusing on high-intent moments rather than general home décor interest.

For audience sizing, do you have data on what percentage of your current customers fall into each of these segments, or should I model based on typical home goods benchmarks?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Perfect - that breakdown aligns well with home goods benchmarks. Recent buyers and renovators typically drive 65-75% of high-value acquisitions in your vertical, so your 60-70% tracks closely.

I'll model using:
- Recent home buyers + renovators: 65% (your highest-converting segments)
- Recent movers: 20% 
- Empty nesters: 15% (secondary focus given longer conversion cycles)

This audience definition should support your $80 CAC target since we're prioritizing the life-stage moments that drive immediate purchase intent.

Now for Step 4 - where geographically are you focusing? Are you targeting nationally, specific regions, or particular metro areas where your audience segments are concentrated?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Great - nationwide reach gives you maximum scale for hitting 5,000 customers. Your instinct about suburban areas and newer housing developments is smart targeting.

Let me model this geographically. For your audience segments, I'd recommend focusing on:

**Primary focus:** Suburban DMAs with high home turnover (recent buyers/movers concentrate here)
**Secondary focus:** Metro suburbs with active renovation activity (higher disposable income)

This approach should improve efficiency versus broad national targeting while maintaining the scale you need.

For audience sizing: Nationally, your combined segments (recent buyers + renovators + movers) represent roughly 8-12 million households annually. At 0.04-0.06% conversion rates typical for home goods, that projects to sufficient scale for your 5,000 target.

Ready for Step 5? With $400K budget targeting these geographic and audience segments, how are you thinking about budget allocation - any priorities between customer segments or geographic areas?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
Based on your conversion performance by segment, here's my recommended allocation:

**By Audience Segment:**
- Recent buyers + renovators: $260K (65% of budget)
- Recent movers: $80K (20% of budget) 
- Empty nesters: $60K (15% of budget)

**By Geography:**
- High-turnover suburban DMAs: $280K (70% of budget)
- Metro suburban areas: $120K (30% of budget)

This allocation prioritizes your highest-converting segments while maintaining enough investment in secondary audiences for scale. The 65%/20%/15% split matches your customer performance data.

At these levels:
- Primary segments: $260K targeting ~3,250 customers at $80 CAC
- Secondary segments: $140K targeting ~1,750 customers at $80 CAC

Does this allocation feel right given what you know about your customer performance, or would you adjust the segment priorities?

Turn 9:
Excellent! Your budget allocation is strategically sound - prioritizing proven converters while maintaining scale opportunities.

Now for Step 6 - your value proposition. With recent home buyers and renovators as your primary targets, what key message or value proposition resonates most with these customers? 

For example, do they respond better to convenience and fast shipping, design expertise and curation, competitive pricing, or something else that differentiates HomeStyle Direct in the crowded home goods space?

Turn 10:
Perfect! Your value proposition has three strong pillars that align beautifully with your target segments:

**Primary Value Props:**
- One-stop convenience (everything in one place)
- Fast shipping (quick move-in/renovation completion)
- Curated room collections (removes decorating overwhelm)

This positioning is smart - recent buyers and renovators are time-pressed and decision-fatigued, so convenience + curation solves their core pain points better than price competition.

Your messaging should emphasize "get settled faster" for recent buyers and "complete your vision quickly" for renovators, with the curated collections as proof points.

Ready for Step 7 - channel strategy? Given your $400K budget, target efficiency of $80 CAC, and audience of intent-driven homeowners, which channels are you currently using, and are there any you're considering adding or adjusting?
