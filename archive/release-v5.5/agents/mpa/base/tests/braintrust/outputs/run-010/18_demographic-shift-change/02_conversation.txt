USER:
Hey, I'm Marketing Manager at UrbanStyle Collective, a streetwear brand. Need help building our media plan for the year. Budget is $1.5M, goal is 100K new customers. We're targeting Millennials 25-40 who are into streetwear and urban fashion. LTV is around $350. Focused on top 25 DMAs.

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by checking your efficiency target. $1.5M ÷ 100K customers = $15 per customer acquisition cost. With $350 LTV, that projects to a 23x LTV/CAC ratio - extremely strong unit economics that gives you significant room for scale.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 100K new customers? For example, are you focused on revenue growth, market share expansion, or establishing presence in new markets?

TURN 2 (Step 1)

USER:
Great question! Our main focus is revenue growth - we want to hit $35M in new customer revenue this year. But we're also looking to expand our market presence, especially in cities where we don't have strong brand awareness yet. The streetwear market is getting more competitive, so establishing ourselves as a go-to brand for urban fashion is really important for long-term growth.

AGENT:
Perfect! Your $35M revenue target aligns well with your customer goals - 100K customers × $350 LTV = $35M exactly. That confirms strong planning alignment.

With revenue growth as your primary objective and market expansion as secondary, how will you measure success? What specific number will tell you this campaign worked? 

For example, would it be total new customer revenue, number of first-time purchasers, or something else that best indicates you're hitting both growth and market presence goals?

TURN 3 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I think the main metric will be total new customer revenue - hitting that $35M number is what the board really cares about. But I'd also want to track first-time purchasers by market to make sure we're actually expanding into those cities where our brand awareness is weak. Maybe looking at brand lift surveys in key DMAs too, since building that market presence is so important for our long-term strategy in this competitive space.

AGENT:
Excellent - $35M new customer revenue as your primary KPI with first-time purchaser tracking by market as your secondary metric. That gives us clear success definition.

Now let's assess if your $15 CAC target is realistic. Based on fashion/apparel benchmarks, typical CACs range from $20-60 depending on brand positioning and channels. Your $15 target is aggressive but achievable for a strong brand with good creative and tight audience targeting.

To hit this efficiency, what's your average order value for new customers? I'm modeling $350 LTV but want to understand if that's from one large purchase or multiple purchases over time - this affects how quickly you can validate the $15 CAC is working.

TURN 4 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Good point on the CAC being aggressive - I was hoping we could be efficient but maybe $15 is too optimistic. For new customers, our average order value is around $120, so that $350 LTV comes from about 3 purchases over their lifetime with us. Most customers make their second purchase within 6 months if they're going to stick around. So we'd need to wait a bit to really validate if our CAC is working long-term.

AGENT:
That's realistic thinking. With $120 AOV, you'd need 3.5x ROAS on first purchase to hit $15 CAC - that's tight but achievable for strong streetwear creative with precise targeting.

However, since most repeat purchases happen within 6 months, you could validate efficiency faster than full LTV. If you hit $30-40 CAC initially, you'd still be well-positioned once repeat purchases factor in.

Let me recalculate: At $30 CAC with your repeat purchase pattern, you'd get $120 immediate + ~$230 in 6-month value = $350 total, maintaining strong unit economics.

Does $25-35 CAC feel more realistic as a target range, or do you want to push for the aggressive $15 and see what's possible with premium creative and tight audience work?

TURN 5 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Yeah, I think $25-35 CAC is probably more realistic given the competitive landscape in streetwear. I'd rather set a target we can actually hit and scale from there. If we nail the creative and targeting and end up closer to $20, that's a nice bonus. Let's plan around $30 CAC - that still gives us solid unit economics and room to optimize. Plus it means we might need fewer customers to hit our revenue target if we're being more conservative on the efficiency side.

AGENT:
Smart approach. At $30 CAC with your $1.5M budget, that projects to 50,000 customers rather than 100K. 

50K customers × $350 LTV = $17.5M in customer value, which falls short of your $35M revenue target.

This means you'll either need to increase budget to reach 100K customers at $30 CAC (would require $3M total), or find ways to drive higher AOV/LTV to hit revenue goals with fewer customers.

Which direction feels more viable - increasing budget allocation for customer acquisition, or focusing on strategies to increase customer value per acquisition?

TURN 6 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Hmm, that's a good catch on the math. Getting more budget might be tough - the $1.5M was already a stretch to get approved. I think we need to focus on increasing customer value. Maybe we could work on bundle offers or premium product lines to boost that initial AOV from $120 to something higher? Or look at strategies to accelerate that second purchase timing. If we could get new customers to spend $150-180 on their first order instead of $120, that would help bridge the gap without needing to double our budget.

AGENT:
Exactly right - increasing AOV is more realistic than doubling budget. If you boost first purchase AOV from $120 to $170, then 50K customers × $170 = $8.5M immediate revenue, plus repeat purchases get you much closer to target.

At $170 AOV with same repeat pattern, total LTV would jump to around $490 per customer. That creates even stronger unit economics and gives you flexibility to invest more in acquisition if needed.

Your economics look solid now. With $30 CAC target and strategies to increase AOV, you have a realistic foundation. 

Ready to move to audience definition? You mentioned Millennials 25-40 interested in streetwear - let's get specific about who within that group converts best for UrbanStyle Collective.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 7 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Yeah, that math makes a lot more sense - $8.5M immediate plus the repeat purchases should get us pretty close to our $35M target. Love that the stronger unit economics give us more flexibility too.

For audience, our best converting customers are usually urban professionals and creatives in the 28-35 range who follow streetwear influencers and shop at places like Kith or Fear of God. They're willing to pay premium for quality pieces that work both for weekend and more casual work settings. Income-wise, probably $50K+ since our price points aren't exactly fast fashion.

AGENT:
Perfect profile - urban professionals and creatives 28-35 with $50K+ income who value premium streetwear that transitions from weekend to work. The Kith/Fear of God reference points are excellent for targeting.

To get more precise for media targeting, what behavioral signals best identify these customers? For example, do they follow specific types of accounts beyond streetwear influencers - like certain fashion publications, lifestyle brands, or cultural movements? 

And are there any purchase behaviors or interests that separate your ideal customers from casual streetwear shoppers who might not convert at premium price points?

TURN 8 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Good question - our best customers tend to follow accounts like Hypebeast, Complex, and The Hundreds for culture content. They're also into sneaker culture, so they follow accounts like Sneaker News and Nice Kicks. Lifestyle-wise, they're interested in coffee culture, vinyl records, and street art.

Purchase behavior-wise, they typically buy fewer pieces but higher quality - they'll spend $200 on one hoodie instead of buying 3 cheaper ones. They also care about limited drops and exclusivity, so they follow brand launch announcements and actually engage with our social content rather than just browsing. The ones who convert usually have a history of buying from other premium streetwear brands, not just fast fashion.

AGENT:
Excellent targeting intel. The cultural interests (coffee culture, vinyl, street art) combined with sneaker culture and premium brand loyalty create strong behavioral signals for targeting.

The "fewer pieces, higher quality" mindset and engagement with limited drops perfectly aligns with your AOV increase strategy - these customers will pay $170+ for the right piece.

One more audience question: Within your top 25 DMAs, are there specific cities where this audience profile is strongest, or markets where you're seeing better conversion rates? Understanding geographic performance will help us allocate that $1.5M budget most effectively across markets.

TURN 9 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're definitely strongest in LA, NYC, and Atlanta - those markets have been our bread and butter. Chicago and Miami are also performing well. But we're seeing some surprising traction in Portland and Austin where the creative scene really resonates with our brand. The markets where we're weaker but want to grow are places like Denver, Seattle, and some of the Texas markets like Dallas and Houston. Our conversion rates in those cities are lower, but when people do convert, they tend to have higher AOVs, so there's definitely opportunity there.

AGENT:
Great market intelligence. Strong performance in LA/NYC/Atlanta with emerging strength in Portland/Austin shows your brand resonates with creative hubs. The higher AOVs in Denver/Seattle/Dallas despite lower conversion rates suggests brand perception is premium but awareness is the barrier.

This creates a clear geographic strategy opportunity - defend and grow in strong markets while building awareness in high-potential expansion markets.

Now let's talk budget allocation. With your $1.5M across these markets, how are you thinking about splitting investment? Should we allocate more heavily to proven markets like LA/NYC for reliable volume, or invest more aggressively in expansion markets like Denver/Seattle where you could build significant presence?

Events: benchmark_cited, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 10 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I think we should probably do a mix - maybe 60% in our strong markets to ensure we hit our volume targets, and 40% in the expansion markets where we can really make an impact. Those proven markets like LA and NYC are going to be our safety net for hitting that 50K customer goal, but the expansion markets like Denver and Seattle could be where we build our future growth. Plus with those higher AOVs in the expansion markets, even if conversion rates are lower initially, the customers we do acquire could be really valuable. What do you think about that split?

AGENT:
That 60/40 split is strategically sound. It balances reliable volume from proven markets with meaningful investment in expansion markets where higher AOVs offset lower conversion rates.

Let me model this: 60% = $900K in strong markets, 40% = $600K in expansion markets. At $30 CAC, that projects to 30K customers from strong markets + 20K from expansion markets = your 50K target.

The expansion market customers with higher AOVs could actually drive more revenue than the 40% allocation suggests, helping bridge that revenue gap we discussed earlier.

Ready to move to value proposition? You mentioned limited drops and exclusivity resonate with your audience. How do you want to position UrbanStyle Collective in the messaging - what makes someone choose you over Kith or Fear of God when they're considering a premium streetwear purchase?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 11 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
That math looks solid - I like how the higher AOVs in expansion markets could actually help us exceed our revenue targets even with the budget split.

For value prop, I think our edge is that we're more accessible than Fear of God but more authentic than some of the bigger players. We focus on pieces that actually work in real life - like you can wear our hoodies to a client meeting or out on the weekend and look put-together either way. Our drops aren't as hyped as Kith, but that means people can actually get the pieces they want without camping online. We're about quality streetwear for people who have real lives, not just hypebeasts chasing the next drop.

AGENT:
Perfect positioning - "quality streetwear for people with real lives." That differentiation between accessible premium (vs Fear of God) and authentic versatility (vs bigger players) is compelling for your 28-35 professional/creative audience.

The "actually get the pieces you want" angle is smart - it positions scarcity fatigue as your advantage rather than trying to out-hype established players.

This messaging should work well across both market types - proven markets will appreciate the authenticity angle, while expansion markets will connect with the professional versatility story.

Ready for channels? With your $1.5M budget, target efficiency, and this audience profile, we need to identify the right media mix to reach urban professionals and creatives who follow streetwear culture but value real-world wearability over pure hype.
