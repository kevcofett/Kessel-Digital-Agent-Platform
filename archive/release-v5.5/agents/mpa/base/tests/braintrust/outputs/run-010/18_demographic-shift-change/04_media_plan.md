# Media Plan Output: Demographic Shift Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by checking your efficiency target. $1.5M ÷ 100K customers = $15 per customer acquisition cost. With $350 LTV, that projects to a 23x LTV/CAC ratio - extremely strong unit economics that gives you significant room for scale.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 100K new customers? For example, are you focused on revenue growth, market share expansion, or establishing presence in new markets?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Your $35M revenue target aligns well with your customer goals - 100K customers × $350 LTV = $35M exactly. That confirms strong planning alignment.

With revenue growth as your primary objective and market expansion as secondary, how will you measure success? What specific number will tell you this campaign worked? 

For example, would it be total new customer revenue, number of first-time purchasers, or something else that best indicates you're hitting both growth and market presence goals?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - $35M new customer revenue as your primary KPI with first-time purchaser tracking by market as your secondary metric. That gives us clear success definition.

Now let's assess if your $15 CAC target is realistic. Based on fashion/apparel benchmarks, typical CACs range from $20-60 depending on brand positioning and channels. Your $15 target is aggressive but achievable for a strong brand with good creative and tight audience targeting.

To hit this efficiency, what's your average order value for new customers? I'm modeling $350 LTV but want to understand if that's from one large purchase or multiple purchases over time - this affects how quickly you can validate the $15 CAC is working.

Turn 4:
That's realistic thinking. With $120 AOV, you'd need 3.5x ROAS on first purchase to hit $15 CAC - that's tight but achievable for strong streetwear creative with precise targeting.

However, since most repeat purchases happen within 6 months, you could validate efficiency faster than full LTV. If you hit $30-40 CAC initially, you'd still be well-positioned once repeat purchases factor in.

Let me recalculate: At $30 CAC with your repeat purchase pattern, you'd get $120 immediate + ~$230 in 6-month value = $350 total, maintaining strong unit economics.

Does $25-35 CAC feel more realistic as a target range, or do you want to push for the aggressive $15 and see what's possible with premium creative and tight audience work?

Turn 5:
Smart approach. At $30 CAC with your $1.5M budget, that projects to 50,000 customers rather than 100K. 

50K customers × $350 LTV = $17.5M in customer value, which falls short of your $35M revenue target.

This means you'll either need to increase budget to reach 100K customers at $30 CAC (would require $3M total), or find ways to drive higher AOV/LTV to hit revenue goals with fewer customers.

Which direction feels more viable - increasing budget allocation for customer acquisition, or focusing on strategies to increase customer value per acquisition?

Turn 6:
Exactly right - increasing AOV is more realistic than doubling budget. If you boost first purchase AOV from $120 to $170, then 50K customers × $170 = $8.5M immediate revenue, plus repeat purchases get you much closer to target.

At $170 AOV with same repeat pattern, total LTV would jump to around $490 per customer. That creates even stronger unit economics and gives you flexibility to invest more in acquisition if needed.

Your economics look solid now. With $30 CAC target and strategies to increase AOV, you have a realistic foundation. 

Ready to move to audience definition? You mentioned Millennials 25-40 interested in streetwear - let's get specific about who within that group converts best for UrbanStyle Collective.

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Perfect profile - urban professionals and creatives 28-35 with $50K+ income who value premium streetwear that transitions from weekend to work. The Kith/Fear of God reference points are excellent for targeting.

To get more precise for media targeting, what behavioral signals best identify these customers? For example, do they follow specific types of accounts beyond streetwear influencers - like certain fashion publications, lifestyle brands, or cultural movements? 

And are there any purchase behaviors or interests that separate your ideal customers from casual streetwear shoppers who might not convert at premium price points?

Turn 8:
Excellent targeting intel. The cultural interests (coffee culture, vinyl, street art) combined with sneaker culture and premium brand loyalty create strong behavioral signals for targeting.

The "fewer pieces, higher quality" mindset and engagement with limited drops perfectly aligns with your AOV increase strategy - these customers will pay $170+ for the right piece.

One more audience question: Within your top 25 DMAs, are there specific cities where this audience profile is strongest, or markets where you're seeing better conversion rates? Understanding geographic performance will help us allocate that $1.5M budget most effectively across markets.

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Great market intelligence. Strong performance in LA/NYC/Atlanta with emerging strength in Portland/Austin shows your brand resonates with creative hubs. The higher AOVs in Denver/Seattle/Dallas despite lower conversion rates suggests brand perception is premium but awareness is the barrier.

This creates a clear geographic strategy opportunity - defend and grow in strong markets while building awareness in high-potential expansion markets.

Now let's talk budget allocation. With your $1.5M across these markets, how are you thinking about splitting investment? Should we allocate more heavily to proven markets like LA/NYC for reliable volume, or invest more aggressively in expansion markets like Denver/Seattle where you could build significant presence?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
That 60/40 split is strategically sound. It balances reliable volume from proven markets with meaningful investment in expansion markets where higher AOVs offset lower conversion rates.

Let me model this: 60% = $900K in strong markets, 40% = $600K in expansion markets. At $30 CAC, that projects to 30K customers from strong markets + 20K from expansion markets = your 50K target.

The expansion market customers with higher AOVs could actually drive more revenue than the 40% allocation suggests, helping bridge that revenue gap we discussed earlier.

Ready to move to value proposition? You mentioned limited drops and exclusivity resonate with your audience. How do you want to position UrbanStyle Collective in the messaging - what makes someone choose you over Kith or Fear of God when they're considering a premium streetwear purchase?

Turn 11:
Perfect positioning - "quality streetwear for people with real lives." That differentiation between accessible premium (vs Fear of God) and authentic versatility (vs bigger players) is compelling for your 28-35 professional/creative audience.

The "actually get the pieces you want" angle is smart - it positions scarcity fatigue as your advantage rather than trying to out-hype established players.

This messaging should work well across both market types - proven markets will appreciate the authenticity angle, while expansion markets will connect with the professional versatility story.

Ready for channels? With your $1.5M budget, target efficiency, and this audience profile, we need to identify the right media mix to reach urban professionals and creatives who follow streetwear culture but value real-world wearability over pure hype.
