TURN 1 (Step 1)

USER:
Hi! I'm looking to get more people to buy shoes from our online store. Can you help me figure out the best way to do that?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve - are you looking to increase total sales, acquire new customers, or grow revenue?

TURN 2 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I want to increase total sales and get new customers too. We're a smaller shoe company and I think we need more people to know about us and actually buy from us. I guess growing revenue is the main goal - we want to make more money from selling more shoes online.

AGENT:
Perfect! Growing revenue through more shoe sales online is a clear objective. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success.

What's your revenue target - how much in total shoe sales are you aiming for from this effort?

TURN 3 (Step 3)

USER:
I haven't really set a specific number yet. I know we have about $250,000 to spend on marketing, so I guess I'd want to see at least that much back in sales, but hopefully more. Maybe we could aim for double that - like $500,000 in sales? I'm not sure what's realistic though.

AGENT:
Got it! So you want to generate $500,000 in shoe sales from a $250,000 marketing budget. Let me show you what that means:

$250,000 budget to generate $500,000 in sales = 2x return on your marketing spend

That's a solid target for online retail. Now I need to understand your customer economics to see if this is achievable.

What's your average order value - how much does a typical customer spend when they buy shoes from you?

TURN 4 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I'm not totally sure about the exact number, but I think most people buy one pair of shoes at a time and our shoes are usually priced between $80 to $150. So maybe around $100 on average? Some customers might buy two pairs or add accessories, but I'd guess most orders are probably in that $100 range.

AGENT:
Perfect! At $100 average order value, your $500,000 sales target means you need 5,000 new customers.

$500,000 sales target ÷ $100 per order = 5,000 customers needed

Now let's check if your budget works: $250,000 ÷ 5,000 customers = $50 per customer

This means you can spend up to $50 to acquire each new customer. For online shoe retailers, this is typically achievable - most see costs between $40-70 per customer.

To make sure this works for your business: what profit do you make on a typical $100 shoe order after covering the cost of the shoes and shipping?
