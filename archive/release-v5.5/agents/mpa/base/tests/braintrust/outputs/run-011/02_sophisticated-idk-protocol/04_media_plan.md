# Media Plan Output: Sophisticated User - IDK Protocol

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with a quick calculation: $500K / 10,000 users = $50 per user acquisition. For remittance fintech, this looks achievable based on typical benchmarks of $40-70 per user.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 10,000 new users - is it transaction volume, revenue growth, or market expansion?

Turn 2:
Perfect! So your objective is revenue growth through scaling transaction volume via 10,000 new users at $50 per acquisition.

Now I need to define how we'll measure success. For remittance, this could be total transaction volume, revenue generated, or users completing their first transaction within a timeframe.

What's your primary success metric - and do you have a specific target number we're aiming to hit this quarter?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent! So we're targeting $15-20M in transaction volume from 10,000 new users = $1,500-2,000 average volume per user this quarter.

Let me model the economics quickly. Assuming a 2.5% take rate (typical for remittance), that projects to:
- $15M volume × 2.5% = $375K revenue (low end)
- $20M volume × 2.5% = $500K revenue (high end)

$500K media spend to generate $375-500K revenue means you're essentially breaking even in quarter 1, which is aggressive but achievable if users continue transacting.

Quick reality check - does that 2.5% take rate assumption sound right for your business model, and are you comfortable with near break-even economics in the first quarter?

Turn 4:
Perfect! At 3% take rate, you're looking at:
- $15M volume × 3% = $450K revenue (low end)  
- $20M volume × 3% = $600K revenue (high end)

So $500K spend generating $450-600K revenue gives you 10-20% positive return in Q1 alone, which is solid for user acquisition.

Your $50 per user target is realistic for remittance. Industry benchmarks typically run $40-70, and your approach of prioritizing user base growth for long-term value makes sense given remittance users tend to have strong repeat behavior.

Step 2 complete - your economics are achievable. Now let's define your target audience. 

Who is your ideal new user? Are you targeting specific demographics, income levels, or people sending to particular countries?
