# Media Plan Output: High-Stakes Performance Campaign

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by analyzing your efficiency target:
$2,000,000 / 50,000 merchants = $40 per merchant acquisition

At $40 CAC with $850 LTV, your LTV:CAC ratio is 21.3x - that's exceptionally strong for fintech where typical ratios run 3-5x.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 50,000 new merchants? Are you focused on revenue growth, market share expansion, or geographic penetration?

Turn 2:
Perfect! So your primary objective is revenue growth with $42M additional ARR, measured through 50,000 new merchant acquisitions. The geographic expansion into secondary markets adds strategic value beyond the core revenue target.

Let me validate your economics: 
$42M ARR / 50,000 merchants = $840 average revenue per merchant annually

This aligns well with your $850 LTV figure. At $40 per merchant acquisition cost, you're targeting a very efficient 21:1 return ratio.

For fintech payments platforms, merchant acquisition costs typically run $60-150 depending on merchant size and vertical. Your $40 target is quite aggressive - about 33% below typical benchmarks. 

What's your average take rate or revenue per transaction that drives the $840 annual value per merchant?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it. At 2.8% take rate with $10K-$100K monthly processing volume, your merchants are generating $280-$2,800 annually just in processing fees, which supports your $840 blended average with SaaS revenue layered in.

The efficiency challenge is significant: moving from $65 historical CAC to $40 target represents a 38% improvement. That's ambitious but achievable with the right approach.

$2M budget at your historical $65 CAC would yield about 30,800 merchants versus your 50,000 target. To bridge that gap while improving efficiency, you'll need tighter audience precision and channel optimization.

Given your secondary market expansion goal, are you planning to maintain the same merchant profile ($10K-$100K monthly volume) in new geographies, or are you open to different merchant segments that might have different acquisition costs and LTV profiles?

Turn 5:
Perfect audience profile. Established businesses (2+ years, 5-25 employees) outgrowing basic solutions is a precise targeting angle. The frustration with current providers creates urgency, and professional services appreciation for integrated features gives you clear value differentiation.

This audience definition has strong implications for your $40 CAC target. Businesses already processing payments and actively seeking alternatives typically convert faster than cold prospects, which should help your efficiency goals.

A few key audience considerations:
- **Audience size**: This profile likely represents 2-3M businesses nationally
- **Targeting precision**: "Outgrowing current solution" signals require careful platform targeting
- **Competitive overlap**: Other processors target similar profiles

What geographic markets are you prioritizing for expansion? Are you looking at specific metro areas, regions, or using other criteria like business density or competitive presence?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Excellent. Maintaining the $10K-$100K volume profile provides consistency, and you're right that secondary markets often offer efficiency advantages due to reduced competition.

Professional services and e-commerce verticals within your volume range could be key efficiency drivers. E-commerce especially tends to have higher transaction frequency, which could push merchants toward the higher end of your processing volume range.

Let me confirm your Step 1 foundation:
- **Objective**: Revenue growth via geographic and vertical expansion
- **Primary KPI**: New merchant acquisitions 
- **Target**: 50,000 merchants generating $42M additional ARR
- **Efficiency Target**: $40 CAC (down from $65 historical)

This is ambitious but strategically sound. Your secondary market expansion should help offset the efficiency pressure.

Now for Step 3 - let's define your target audience. Within that $10K-$100K monthly volume range, what are the key characteristics that define your highest-converting merchants? Think business age, employee count, current payment solutions, or other qualifying factors.

Turn 6:
Smart approach. Tier-2 cities with 10K+ target businesses provide scale while avoiding oversaturated metros. Using Atlanta and Charlotte as proof points gives you benchmarking data for projections.

Your competitive presence insight is sophisticated - educated markets with switching precedent should reduce conversion friction and potentially improve your $40 CAC target vs. cold markets.

Let me model some geography sizing:
- Austin: ~15,000 target businesses (2+ years, 5-25 employees)
- Nashville: ~12,000 target businesses  
- Denver: ~18,000 target businesses
- Phoenix: ~22,000 target businesses

These four markets alone represent ~67,000 businesses, giving you solid audience depth for 50,000 acquisition target.

Are you planning to launch all target markets simultaneously, or phasing the rollout? And do you have preference for markets where you can establish local partnerships or attend industry events?

Turn 7:
Excellent phased approach. Austin and Denver Q1 launch leverages your largest addressable markets and professional services strength.

Your partnership insight is crucial for CAC efficiency. Accounting firm referrals typically convert at 3-5x higher rates than cold digital acquisition, which could significantly help your $40 target vs. $65 historical.

Two markets per quarter with 50,000 annual target means:
- Q1 (Austin/Denver): ~12,500 merchants
- Q2: ~12,500 merchants  
- Q3: ~12,500 merchants
- Q4: ~12,500 merchants

This pacing allows optimization learning from early markets to improve later performance.

Now for Step 5 - Budget allocation. With $2M total budget, how are you thinking about splitting between:
- Digital acquisition campaigns
- Partnership development and referral programs
- Local market entry activities
- Brand building in new markets

What percentage would you allocate to pure digital acquisition versus these other channels?

Turn 9:
Excellent channel strategy. The 60/40 split between search and awareness aligns perfectly with your dual objectives of capturing active demand while building presence in new markets.

Let me break down your digital allocation:
- Search (Google + LinkedIn): $840,000 targeting active seekers
- Awareness (Programmatic B2B + LinkedIn brand): $560,000 for market education

LinkedIn spanning both buckets is smart - it's your primary platform for reaching 5-25 employee business decision-makers. Professional services firms especially engage well on LinkedIn, supporting your vertical focus.

For measurement, given your aggressive efficiency target, what metrics beyond CAC are you planning to track? Are you looking at incrementality measurement to validate your $40 performance, or focusing on platform-reported attribution?

Platform-reported ROAS can be inflated 20-40% due to attribution overlap and view-through crediting, so incrementality testing might be critical for defending your efficiency claims to leadership.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Smart allocation. Your partnership strategy is key to making the economics work:

70% digital: $1,400,000 / ~35,000 digital acquisitions = $40 CAC exactly
20% partnerships: $400,000 / ~15,000 referral acquisitions = $27 CAC (typical referral efficiency)
10% market entry: $200,000 for brand building and local presence

This blended approach gets you to your $40 average while allowing digital channels to run slightly higher, subsidized by lower-cost referrals.

The referral LTV advantage is crucial - referred merchants typically show 20-30% higher retention and transaction volume since they come validated by trusted advisors.

For your digital budget allocation within that $1.4M, what's your initial thinking on channel mix? Are you leaning toward search-heavy since these are businesses actively seeking payment solutions, or planning broader awareness channels for market entry?

Turn 10:
Excellent measurement framework. MQL-to-SQL conversion and time-to-close by channel will reveal true quality differences - critical when optimizing toward aggressive CAC targets.

Geo-holdout tests in new markets are perfect for incrementality measurement. You'll get clean lift data without existing market noise, and cohort LTV tracking will validate your partnership strategy thesis.

The 30-60 day sales cycle for larger merchants definitely requires assisted conversion tracking. Multi-touch attribution becomes crucial when LinkedIn awareness campaigns influence Google search conversions weeks later.

For testing strategy, what's your approach to creative and audience experimentation? With your $40 efficiency target, you'll need rapid optimization cycles. Are you planning systematic A/B testing, or more dynamic optimization approaches?

Given your professional services focus, messaging around "outgrowing basic solutions" versus "integrated invoicing features" could significantly impact conversion rates and should be tested early in Q1.
