# Media Plan Output: Full 10-Step Media Planning

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your efficiency target. With $750K budget and 15,000 customers:
$750,000 / 15,000 = $50 per customer

That's your implied cost per customer (what you'll spend in ads to get one new buyer). For home decor, typical acquisition costs run $40-80 per customer, so you're right in the sweet spot.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 15,000 new customers?

Turn 2:
Perfect! You've outlined strong business outcomes - 25% customer base growth and long-term value focus. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success as a specific number.

Since you mentioned repeat buyers and long-term growth, what's your primary success metric? Are you tracking:
- Total revenue from these 15,000 customers over their lifetime
- First-year revenue target 
- Average order value goals
- Or another specific number that defines success?

I need one measurable KPI to model whether your $50 per customer target is realistic given what customers are worth to your business.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent! Let me verify this makes strong business sense:

$450 customer lifetime value / $50 acquisition cost = 9:1 return

That's outstanding efficiency for home decor. Your LTV-to-CAC ratio of 9x is well above the 3x minimum for healthy unit economics, giving you plenty of margin for growth.

At $450 LTV × 15,000 customers = $6.75M total lifetime revenue, as you calculated.

This confirms your $50 per customer target is not just achievable but conservative. You have room to spend more per customer if needed to hit volume goals, or opportunity to scale beyond 15,000 customers at this efficiency.

Now let's define who these 15,000 customers are. What's your primary target audience - who are the people most likely to buy home decor and furniture from HomeStyle Decor?

Turn 4:
Great foundation! Homeowners 30-55 with home improvement intent is a solid core audience. Let me dig deeper on a few key targeting signals that will impact your reach and efficiency.

Beyond age and homeownership, what behavioral signals best identify your ideal customers? For example:
- Recent home purchase or move
- Specific life events (new baby, renovation, etc.)
- Shopping behaviors (browsing furniture sites, Pinterest activity)
- Income thresholds that predict purchase likelihood

These behavioral layers will help us estimate your total addressable audience size and refine that $50 per customer target.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Perfect! You've identified strong behavioral signals that create a much more targeted audience than just age and homeownership. Let me model your addressable audience:

Starting with your core demographics (homeowners 30-55, $75K+ income), then layering behavioral signals:
- Recent home purchase (6-12 months)
- Major life transitions (marriage, kids, empty nest)
- Active home improvement browsing behavior
- Interior design/Pinterest engagement

These behavioral layers will significantly reduce your total addressable audience but increase conversion rates, which should support your $50 per customer efficiency.

Now for geography - where do you want to focus these 15,000 customer acquisitions? Are you targeting:
- Nationwide across all markets
- Specific regions or states
- Top metro areas only
- Or certain markets where you see strongest performance?

Geographic focus will help us size your audience more precisely and allocate that $750K budget effectively.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent geographic strategy! Let me break down your budget allocation:

70% of $750K = $525K for top metros (NYC, LA, Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta, Seattle)
30% of $750K = $225K for expansion markets (Denver, Nashville, Austin)

This gives you:
$525K / 10,500 customers = $50 per customer in proven markets
$225K / 4,500 customers = $50 per customer in expansion markets

Your target efficiency stays consistent across geographies, which is smart for testing. The proven metros should hit that $50 target reliably, while expansion markets give you upside potential if they perform better than expected.

Now let's confirm your overall budget approach. You have $750K total for 15,000 customers. How do you want to allocate this between:
- New customer acquisition vs. retention/repeat purchase campaigns
- Or is the full $750K dedicated purely to acquiring those 15,000 new customers?

Turn 7:
Perfect! That makes the math clean and focused:

$750K / 15,000 new customers = $50 per customer acquisition cost

All budget goes toward first-time buyers, which aligns perfectly with your $450 LTV and 9:1 return ratio.

Now let's develop your value proposition - what you'll say to convince these prospects to choose HomeStyle Decor. Based on your target audience (homeowners 30-55 in major metros going through life changes), what's your primary competitive advantage?

Is it:
- Product quality and style at accessible prices
- Unique design aesthetic they can't find elsewhere
- Superior shopping experience (easy ordering, fast delivery, etc.)
- Expert curation that saves them time and effort
- Or something else that makes you the obvious choice?

Your value proposition will drive all messaging and creative across channels.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Great insights! Your channel instincts are spot-on. Let me recommend an optimized mix based on your curation message and audience behavior:

**Primary channels (70% of budget = $525K):**
- Pinterest: Perfect for "expert curation" - people actively seeking inspiration
- Meta (Facebook/Instagram): Strong for your demographics, visual products
- Google Search: Capture high-intent decorating searches

**Secondary channels (30% of budget = $225K):**
- Programmatic display: Reach people browsing home improvement content
- YouTube: Showcase room settings and curation expertise

This mix hits your audience across their decorating journey:
- Pinterest/YouTube: Early inspiration phase
- Meta: Consideration and social proof
- Google: High-intent purchase moments
- Display: Retargeting and awareness

At $50 per customer, this blend should work well. Pinterest typically runs $30-60 CAC for home/lifestyle, Meta $40-80, Google $20-100 depending on keywords.

Does this channel approach align with how you see your customers discovering and buying from you?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
Excellent value proposition! "Expert curation at accessible prices" directly addresses your audience's pain points - busy homeowners who want beautiful spaces but lack time/confidence to design them.

Your messaging framework is:
- Primary benefit: Takes the guesswork out of decorating
- Proof points: Curated collections that work together, room settings for visualization
- Competitive positioning: Quality and style without luxury pricing

This should resonate strongly with your target audience of time-pressed homeowners going through life transitions who need their spaces to feel put-together quickly.

Now let's build your channel strategy. With $750K for 15,000 customers at $50 each, and your "expert curation" value prop, which channels do you think would work best to reach homeowners actively in decorating mode?

Are you currently using any channels that perform well, or should we start fresh with the most effective options for your audience and message?

Turn 10:
Excellent! Your channel mix is well-aligned with customer behavior. Let me break down the specific allocation:

**Primary channels (70% = $525K):**
- Pinterest: 35% = $262,500 (targeting 5,250 customers at ~$50 CAC)
- Meta: 25% = $187,500 (targeting 3,750 customers at ~$50 CAC) 
- Google Search: 10% = $75,000 (targeting 1,500 customers at ~$50 CAC)

**Secondary channels (30% = $225K):**
- YouTube: 20% = $150,000 (targeting 3,000 customers at ~$50 CAC)
- Programmatic Display: 10% = $75,000 (targeting 1,500 customers at ~$50 CAC)

Total: 15,000 customers at $750K budget

Now for measurement - how will you track whether each channel is actually delivering customers at your $50 target? Do you have:
- Attribution tracking across channels
- Customer lifetime value measurement by source
- Or specific KPIs you want to monitor beyond just cost per customer?

Turn 11:
Smart recognition that last-click attribution undersells upper-funnel channels like Pinterest and YouTube! Here's a measurement framework that will give you the real picture:

**Primary KPIs:**
- Cost per customer by channel (your $50 target)
- Customer LTV by acquisition source (expect variation from your $450 average)
- Time to first purchase by channel

**Attribution approach:**
- Implement first-click and view-through attribution alongside last-click
- Use UTM parameters and channel-specific promo codes
- Set up Google Analytics 4 with enhanced ecommerce tracking

**Expected patterns:**
- Pinterest/YouTube: Higher assisted conversions, longer consideration time
- Google Search: Lower assisted, faster purchase decisions  
- Meta: Mixed - both direct and assisted conversions

You should see Pinterest and YouTube customers take 2-4 weeks longer to convert but potentially deliver higher LTV due to better brand connection.

Now for testing - with $750K across 5 channels, what's your biggest concern or uncertainty that we should plan to test and optimize?

Turn 12:
Excellent priorities! Both YouTube execution and Pinterest creative strategy are critical success factors. Here's a testing plan for your biggest uncertainties:

**YouTube Testing (Month 1-2, $30K of the $150K budget):**
- Test A: Simple room tour videos with voiceover explaining curation choices
- Test B: Before/after room transformations showing your pieces
- Test C: Quick styling tip videos featuring your products
- Measure: View rates, click-through rates, cost per customer

**Pinterest Creative Testing (Month 1-3, $50K of the $262K budget):**
- Test A: Styled room settings vs individual product shots
- Test B: Professional photography vs user-generated content  
- Test C: Lifestyle pins vs product-focused pins
- Measure: Save rates, click-through rates, conversion rates

This reserves $80K total for learning while protecting the majority of your budget for proven approaches.

Finally, what's your biggest risk concern - the one thing that could derail hitting your 15,000 customer target? Is it:
- Seasonal fluctuations in home decor demand
- Rising channel costs
- Creative fatigue
- Or something else entirely?

Turn 13:
Smart risk identification! Rising costs plus seasonal slumps could create a perfect storm. Here's your risk mitigation plan:

**Cost Inflation Protection:**
- Build 15% cost buffer: If CAC hits $57.50 ($50 + 15%), you still acquire 13,000+ customers
- Reallocate from underperforming to efficient channels monthly
- Have backup channels ready (email marketing, affiliate programs)

**Seasonal Mitigation:**
- Front-load Q1 spend in December/January before slowdown
- Shift messaging in slow months: "winter refresh" vs "spring decorating"
- Use Q1 lull for creative development and testing new approaches

**Contingency Options:**
- If costs spike 20%+: Reduce target to 12,500 customers, maintain $50 efficiency
- If budget becomes available: Scale efficient channels up to 18,000 customers
- Emergency pivot: Shift 20% budget from acquisition to retention for immediate revenue

**Monthly Check-ins:**
Monitor blended CAC across all channels. If trending above $52 for two consecutive weeks, trigger reallocation protocol.

You're ready to launch! This plan gives you 15,000 customers at $50 each with built-in flexibility for market changes. Any final questions on execution?
