# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience Unified Media Plan

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start - you've provided rich audience detail and clear volume targets. Let me calculate your efficiency target first:

$3,000,000 / 25,000 enrollees = $120 per enrollment

This is reasonable for health insurance where acquisition costs typically run $100-150 per enrollment based on industry benchmarks.

Before we dive into your three-segment approach, what specific business outcome are you trying to achieve beyond the 25,000 enrollees? Are you focused on total membership growth, market share in specific regions, or revenue targets?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect - sustainable growth across diversified segments with emphasis on young professional expansion. Your $120 per enrollment target supports this growth strategy well.

Now let me assess the economics. With health insurance, the key question is whether $120 per enrollment generates positive unit economics given your premium structure and retention rates.

$3,000,000 / 25,000 = $120 per enrollment

For this to work profitably, you need either strong first-year contribution margins or solid retention to recover acquisition costs over time. 

What's your average annual premium per member, and do you have a sense of typical member retention rates? This will help us validate whether $120 acquisition cost creates sustainable growth.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Got it - I'll model using reasonable insurance industry assumptions and you can refine anytime. Based on your premium ranges and 80% retention (mid-range estimate), here's what the economics look like:

**Young Professionals:** $4,500 avg premium × 80% retention = ~$900 first-year value
**Families:** $13,500 avg premium × 80% retention = ~$2,700 first-year value  
**Pre-Medicare:** $7,000 avg premium × 80% retention = ~$1,400 first-year value

At $120 acquisition cost, all segments show strong first-year payback. Even conservative scenarios work well.

This validates your $120 per enrollment target as achievable and profitable. We can build the plan knowing the economics support your growth strategy.

Moving to Step 3 - with three distinct audience segments, how do you want to split the 25,000 enrollment target across Young Professionals, Families, and Pre-Medicare segments?

Turn 4:
Excellent allocation - you're balancing economics with strategic priorities:

**Families:** 12,000 enrollees (48%) - leveraging best unit economics and existing traction
**Young Professionals:** 8,000 enrollees (32%) - strategic growth investment  
**Pre-Medicare:** 5,000 enrollees (20%) - efficient segment with geographic constraints

This gives us segment-specific efficiency targets:
- Families: $3M × 48% = $1,440,000 / 12,000 = $120 per enrollment
- Young Professionals: $3M × 32% = $960,000 / 8,000 = $120 per enrollment  
- Pre-Medicare: $3M × 20% = $600,000 / 5,000 = $120 per enrollment

Interesting that your target efficiency is consistent across segments despite different premium levels - this suggests you're prioritizing growth velocity over short-term margin optimization.

Now for geography: You mentioned specific markets for each segment. Should we map out the geographic targeting by segment, starting with your young professionals in NYC, SF, LA, Chicago metros?

Turn 5:
Perfect - you've identified distinct geographic strategies that align with each segment's lifestyle patterns. Let me structure this by segment:

**Young Professionals (8,000 enrollees):** 7 major urban DMAs
- New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose, Chicago, Seattle-Tacoma, Austin, Denver
- Focus on urban cores where 26-35 professionals live and work

**Families (12,000 enrollees):** Suburban rings around top 50 metros  
- Suburban DMAs/corridors around major metros like Dallas-Ft. Worth suburbs, Orange County, Westchester County area
- Target family-dense suburban communities with good school districts

**Pre-Medicare (5,000 enrollees):** National with sunbelt emphasis
- Heavy focus on Florida DMAs (Miami, Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville)
- Arizona DMAs (Phoenix, Tucson) 
- Texas DMAs (Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Austin)
- Secondary markets nationwide

Should we start with the Young Professionals geography and size the target audience in those 7 urban DMAs? We can calculate target audience size using demographic filters for ages 26-35 in urban cores.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent point about filtering beyond just age - employment status and employer coverage are crucial for health insurance targeting.

Let me model the addressable market for young professionals in your 7 urban DMAs:

**Total 26-35 population in urban cores:** ~2.8M across NYC, LA, SF, Chicago, Seattle, Austin, Denver
**Self-employed/small company employees:** ~25% = 700,000 (those needing individual coverage)
**Income qualified ($50K+ for individual plans):** ~70% = 490,000
**Actively shopping/switchable:** ~15% annually = 73,500

So your addressable market is roughly 73,500 potential enrollees annually across these 7 DMAs.

Your target of 8,000 enrollees = 8,000 / 73,500 = 11% market capture

This is aggressive but achievable for a focused digital campaign. Health insurance typically sees 8-15% capture rates in well-targeted campaigns.

Does this market sizing align with your expectations, or should we adjust any of the filtering assumptions?

Turn 7:
You're absolutely right - 11% capture for a new segment is optimistic. Let me recalculate with your more realistic shopping rate:

**Actively shopping at 11% annually:** 490,000 × 11% = 53,900 addressable

Your 8,000 target = 8,000 / 53,900 = 15% capture rate

That's quite aggressive for building from scratch. At a more realistic 8-9% capture rate:
- 8% capture = 53,900 × 8% = 4,300 enrollees  
- 9% capture = 53,900 × 9% = 4,850 enrollees

This suggests either reducing the young professional target to ~5,000 enrollees or increasing their budget allocation to drive higher capture through increased frequency and reach.

Should we adjust the young professional target down to 5,000 and reallocate those 3,000 enrollees to families where you have more traction, or increase their budget share to support the 8,000 target?

Turn 8:
Perfect adjustment - much more realistic targeting. Here's the revised allocation:

**Young Professionals:** 5,000 enrollees (20%) = 9% capture rate - achievable for new segment build
**Families:** 15,000 enrollees (60%) = leveraging best unit economics and existing traction  
**Pre-Medicare:** 5,000 enrollees (20%) = solid segment with geographic focus

Updated budget allocation:
- Young Professionals: $3M × 20% = $600,000 / 5,000 = $120 per enrollment
- Families: $3M × 60% = $1,800,000 / 15,000 = $120 per enrollment
- Pre-Medicare: $3M × 20% = $600,000 / 5,000 = $120 per enrollment

This weighting toward families (60% of budget) makes strategic sense given their $2,700 first-year value versus $900 for young professionals.

Now let's size the family segment audience. For suburban rings around top 50 metros, we're looking at ages 35-50 with children under 18. Should we focus on the self-employed/small business employee filter again, or do families have different coverage patterns we should consider?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Excellent insight - family coverage scenarios are much more complex than individual young professionals. Let me model the broader addressable market:

**Total 35-50 population with kids in suburban rings around top 50 metros:** ~8.5M households

**Coverage scenarios needing individual plans:**
- Self-employed/small company: ~20% = 1.7M
- Employer plan transitions (job changes, layoffs): ~8% = 680K  
- High-deductible plan switchers: ~12% = 1.02M
- Mixed employment (one spouse needs coverage): ~5% = 425K

**Total addressable:** ~3.8M households
**Income qualified for family plans ($75K+ household):** ~75% = 2.85M
**Actively shopping annually:** ~12% = 342K households

Your 15,000 target = 15,000 / 342K = 4.4% capture rate

That's much more realistic for families where you have existing traction. The broader coverage scenarios significantly expand your addressable market compared to young professionals.

Does this family market sizing feel right given the multiple coverage transition scenarios?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Perfect - the high-deductible frustration and mixed employment trends are definitely driving family segment growth. The 342K shopping households gives you a substantial target universe.

Now let's size Pre-Medicare in your sunbelt-focused national approach. For ages 55-64 with emphasis on Florida, Arizona, and Texas DMAs:

**Total 55-64 population nationally:** ~41M
**Concentrated in FL/AZ/TX DMAs:** ~35% = 14.4M
**Needing individual coverage scenarios:**
- Early retirement/COBRA transitions: ~8% = 1.15M
- Self-employed/consulting: ~12% = 1.73M  
- Employer plan gaps: ~5% = 720K

**Total addressable in key geographies:** ~3.6M
**Income qualified:** ~80% = 2.9M
**Actively shopping annually:** ~10% = 290K

Your 5,000 target = 5,000 / 290K = 1.7% capture rate

Extremely achievable given this segment's focus on stability and network quality - exactly what you offer.

Ready to move to Step 5 and break down that $3M budget allocation across the three segments and their geographic footprints?

Turn 11:
Excellent - let's break down the $3M budget allocation. You're absolutely right that cost structures vary significantly by segment and geography.

**Current allocation by enrollment targets:**
- Young Professionals: $600,000 (20%)
- Families: $1,800,000 (60%) 
- Pre-Medicare: $600,000 (20%)

**Geographic cost considerations:**
- Urban metros (Young Professionals): Higher CPMs, premium inventory
- Suburban rings (Families): Moderate costs, efficient targeting
- National sunbelt (Pre-Medicare): Lower CPMs but broader reach needed

Given the cost differentials, should we adjust budget allocation? For example:
- Young Professionals might need $700-800K due to expensive urban media
- Pre-Medicare might operate efficiently at $500-550K with lower-cost national reach
- Families could absorb the difference while maintaining their volume priority

Or do you want to maintain the enrollment-based allocation and adjust efficiency expectations by segment?

What's your preference for handling these geographic cost differences?

Turn 12:
Perfect reallocation - much more realistic for the geographic realities. Here's the adjusted budget breakdown:

**Young Professionals:** $750,000 (25%) / 5,000 = $150 per enrollment
- Accounts for premium urban CPMs in NYC, SF, LA, Chicago markets

**Families:** $1,700,000 (57%) / 15,000 = $113 per enrollment  
- Efficient suburban targeting with moderate costs

**Pre-Medicare:** $550,000 (18%) / 5,000 = $110 per enrollment
- Lower-cost national reach with sunbelt emphasis

This creates realistic efficiency expectations: $150 for expensive urban markets, $113 for suburban families, $110 for broader national targeting.

The family segment maintains budget priority at 57% while the young professional premium ($150 vs $120 original target) properly accounts for urban media costs.

Now for Step 6 - Value Proposition. Each segment needs different messaging. Should we start with defining the core value proposition for families since they're your largest budget allocation, or tackle all three segment messages together?
