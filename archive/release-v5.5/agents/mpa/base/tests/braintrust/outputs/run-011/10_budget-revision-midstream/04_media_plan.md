# Media Plan Output: Budget Revision Midstream

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by calculating your efficiency target: $500,000 / 10,000 = $50 per customer. With $2,400 LTV, that's a strong 48:1 LTV to CAC ratio - very healthy for B2B SaaS where 3:1+ is typically the minimum.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 10,000 new customers? Are you focused on revenue growth, market expansion, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Revenue growth through mid-market expansion gives us clear direction. At $2,400 LTV per customer, 10,000 new customers projects to $24 million in new revenue - a significant scale jump.

Your $50 per customer target is aggressive but achievable for B2B SaaS. Mid-market typically sees $75-150 CACs, so you're aiming 33-67% below market benchmarks. This will require tight audience targeting and efficient channels.

How do you define success for this campaign? What's your primary KPI - is it the 10,000 customer count, the $24M revenue target, or something else like qualified pipeline or trial conversions?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - 10,000 new customers as your primary KPI with pipeline metrics as leading indicators makes perfect sense given your 3-4 month sales cycle.

Your $50 per customer target is ambitious for B2B SaaS. To hit this efficiently, we'll need precision targeting and channel optimization. The good news is your strong LTV gives us room to adjust if needed while maintaining healthy unit economics.

Quick economics check: what's your typical gross margin on these $2,400 LTV customers? This helps us understand how much flexibility we have if acquisition costs run higher than $50.

Turn 4:
Great! At 65% gross margin on $2,400 LTV, that's $1,560 gross profit per customer. Even if your CAC runs to $100-120, you'd still maintain a healthy 13-15:1 gross profit to CAC ratio, which is excellent for B2B SaaS.

Your $50 target is definitely aggressive - you're aiming for roughly 3% of gross LTV as acquisition cost, where market typically runs 5-8%. To hit this, we'll need laser-focused targeting and high-converting channels.

Based on your current customer base and mid-market focus, you likely have strong first-party data for lookalike targeting. Do you have a solid database of your best customers that we can use to build precise audience models?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Perfect! Manufacturing and professional services in the 200-500 employee range gives us excellent targeting precision. That's roughly 150,000-200,000 companies in the US, so solid scale for your 10,000 customer target.

Your first-party data will be crucial for hitting that aggressive $50 CAC. Lookalike modeling from your best customers should significantly improve conversion rates versus broad B2B targeting.

Step 1 complete - we have your objective (10,000 new customers), primary KPI (customer count), and realistic efficiency assessment. 

Now for Step 2 economics validation: At $50 per customer with 65% margins, we're targeting 3.2% of gross profit as acquisition cost. This is achievable but requires disciplined execution. Your safety margin to $100-120 CAC gives us room to optimize.

Ready to move to Step 3 and define your target audience signals more precisely?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent! For B2B SaaS targeting 10,000 customers at $50 CAC, we need 15-25 precise signals to hit your efficiency target.

Beyond company size (200-500 employees) and verticals (manufacturing, professional services), let's build out your audience profile:

**Technographic signals** are critical for analytics SaaS - what technology stack do your best customers typically use? Do they have existing BI tools, CRMs, or data warehouses that indicate analytics sophistication?

**Behavioral signals** matter too - are your best customers typically growing companies, those undergoing digital transformation, or companies with specific operational challenges?

Starting with technographics: what common technology patterns do you see across your highest-value manufacturing and professional services customers?

Turn 7:
Perfect! Those are high-intent signals that should dramatically improve your targeting precision.

**Technology stack indicators:**
- Salesforce/HubSpot users (indicates sales sophistication)
- Tableau/Power BI users (shows analytics need but integration gaps)
- AWS/Azure infrastructure (cloud-forward companies)

**Growth/behavioral signals:**
- Recent funding rounds
- Market expansion activities  
- Increasing data complexity pain points
- Outgrowing spreadsheet-based analytics

This profile suggests companies at an inflection point - they have the foundation (CRM, some BI) but need better integration and insights. That's a strong value proposition match.

For geographic focus: are your best customers concentrated in specific regions, or do you see strong performance across all major US markets? This affects whether we should focus nationally or prioritize certain DMAs.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Excellent geographic insight! National reach with concentrated investment in proven markets is smart strategy.

**High-concentration markets for heavier investment:**
- Bay Area, Austin (tech hubs)
- Boston-NYC-DC corridor (tech + professional services)
- Chicago, Minneapolis (manufacturing + tech)
- Toronto, Vancouver (Canadian expansion)

**Audience definition summary:**
- 200-500 employees in manufacturing/professional services
- Salesforce/HubSpot + existing BI tools (Tableau/Power BI)
- AWS/Azure infrastructure
- Growth signals: recent funding, market expansion, data complexity
- Geographic concentration in tech/manufacturing hubs

This targeting should significantly improve your conversion rates versus broad B2B approaches. With 15+ precise signals, you're well-positioned for that aggressive $50 CAC target.

Ready for Step 4 to finalize geographic allocation strategy, or do you want to refine any audience signals first?

Turn 9:
Great question! Geographic allocation is crucial for maximizing your $500K efficiently while capturing growth opportunities.

**Market sizing analysis:**
Your high-concentration markets (Bay Area, Austin, Northeast corridor, Chicago/Minneapolis, Toronto/Vancouver) likely represent 40-50% of your total addressable market but with 2-3x higher conversion rates based on your proven traction.

**Suggested allocation framework:**
- 60-65% to proven high-concentration markets ($300-325K)
- 35-40% to broader national coverage ($175-200K)

This balances efficiency (investing where you convert best) with growth (discovering new pockets of demand).

Within your high-concentration markets, we could weight by both market size and your historical performance. For example, Bay Area might get larger allocation than Minneapolis due to sheer market size, even if conversion rates are similar.

What's your current customer distribution across these markets? Are you seeing roughly equal performance in Bay Area vs Northeast vs Midwest, or do some markets significantly outperform others?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Excellent insights! Higher conversion rates in Midwest manufacturing vs Bay Area makes perfect sense - less competition and stronger product-market fit.

**Refined allocation based on your performance data:**

**High-concentration markets (65% = $325K):**
- Midwest manufacturing hubs: $90K (strong conversion, lower competition)
- Northeast corridor: $85K (high volume, proven performance) 
- Austin: $70K (growing momentum, good efficiency)
- Bay Area: $65K (high volume but higher CACs due to competition)
- Canada (Toronto/Vancouver): $15K (conservative test, 3% of total budget)

**Broader national coverage: $175K (35%)**

This weights toward your highest-converting markets while maintaining Bay Area presence and taking a measured approach to Canada expansion.

Does this allocation feel right given your market performance data? Should we adjust the Midwest vs Northeast split, or does the conservative Canada approach align with your expansion timeline?
