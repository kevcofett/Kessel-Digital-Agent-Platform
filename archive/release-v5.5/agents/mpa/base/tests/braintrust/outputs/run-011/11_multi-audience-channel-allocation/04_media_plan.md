# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience with Segment-Specific Channels

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a sophisticated media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

$5M / 50,000 enrollments = $100 per enrollment - that's your target efficiency across all segments. For online education, benchmarks typically run $80-150 per enrollment, so you're well-positioned at the midpoint.

What specific business outcome are you driving beyond enrollment volume? Revenue target, course completion rates, or enterprise contract value?

Turn 2:
Perfect. $15M revenue target with $5M media spend = 3:1 return on ad spend, which is solid for education.

Let me break down your segment economics:

**Career Changers**: $2,500 average × volume needed
**College-Age**: $1,000 average × volume needed  
**Corporate L&D**: $30,000 average × volume needed

To hit $15M total revenue across 50,000 enrollments, we need to determine the enrollment mix. The math doesn't work with equal splits - corporate deals are much higher value but likely lower volume.

What's your target enrollment split across the three segments? This will determine budget allocation and realistic volume expectations per segment.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 4:
Perfect, now the math works:

**College-Age**: 15,000 leads × 9% conversion × $1,000 = $1.35M
**Career Changers**: 7,500 leads × 17.5% conversion × $2,500 = $3.28M  
**Corporate L&D**: 10,000 leads × 5% conversion × $30,000 = $15M

Total leads: 32,500 for $19.63M revenue potential - exceeding your $15M target with buffer.

$5M budget / 32,500 leads = $154 cost per lead blended. But your segment economics vary dramatically:

- College-age can afford $135 per lead ($1,350 LTV ÷ 10 = break-even)
- Career changers can afford $438 per lead  
- Corporate can afford $1,500 per lead

This suggests very different budget allocations than your lead volume ratios. Corporate L&D should get disproportionate budget given their efficiency tolerance.

Are you comfortable with that economic reality, or do we need to adjust the lead mix?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Let me check that math:

**College-Age**: 30,000 enrollments × $1,000 = $30M
**Career Changers**: 15,000 enrollments × $2,500 = $37.5M  
**Corporate L&D**: 5,000 enrollments × $30,000 = $150M

Total: $217.5M - that's way above your $15M target.

I think there's a disconnect. Are these enrollment numbers referring to leads/prospects rather than paid enrollments? Or are the average order values different than stated?

To hit $15M with your pricing:
- 15,000 college-age paid enrollments = $15M alone
- 6,000 career changer paid enrollments = $15M alone  
- 500 corporate paid deals = $15M alone

What's the actual conversion rate from enrollment to paid customer for each segment?

Turn 6:
That attribution gap is critical for a $3M corporate investment. LinkedIn content and trade publication ads are classic top-funnel drivers in B2B education, but first/last-touch models will systematically under-credit them.

For your 4-6 month cycles, you'll need view-through attribution windows of at least 180 days, ideally with position-based or time-decay models that credit early touchpoints appropriately.

Given these attribution limitations, we should plan conservatively on corporate efficiency and build in incrementality testing from launch. Your $300 per lead target assumes perfect attribution - reality may require $400-500 per lead to account for unmeasured top-funnel impact.

Now let's define your audience targeting. You outlined three distinct segments, but we need to get specific on targeting signals for each. Starting with Career Changers (28-42) - beyond LinkedIn usage, what job titles, company sizes, or behavioral signals identify someone actively considering upskilling?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Excellent strategic thinking. Your budget allocation aligns with unit economics:

**60% Corporate L&D**: $3M budget / 10,000 leads = $300 per lead (well under $1,500 tolerance)
**25% Career Changers**: $1.25M budget / 7,500 leads = $167 per lead (under $438 tolerance)  
**15% College-Age**: $750K budget / 15,000 leads = $50 per lead (under $135 tolerance)

This creates healthy efficiency margins for optimization across all segments while maximizing your highest-value opportunity.

You mentioned the corporate segment's longer sales cycle - that's critical for measurement and attribution. B2B cycles in education typically run 3-6 months from first touch to close.

What's your typical sales cycle length for corporate L&D deals, and do you have multi-touch attribution in place to track the full journey?

Turn 7:
Excellent targeting foundation. Career changers at 500-5K employee companies is smart - large enough for advancement paths but not so large that they're lost in corporate L&D programs.

Let me capture those signals:
- Job titles: Marketing Manager, Software Engineer, Business Analyst, Product Manager
- Company size: 500-5,000 employees
- Behavioral: Industry trend content, thought leader engagement, career growth discussions

For College-Age (18-24) targeting, you mentioned TikTok/Instagram and creator influence. Beyond age, what specific signals identify someone exploring degree alternatives? Are they currently enrolled somewhere, recent graduates, or never enrolled? And what content themes resonate - career anxiety, student debt concerns, practical skills focus?

Turn 8:
Perfect audience definition. The "questioning ROI" and "alternative path success stories" themes are powerful differentiators.

Key signals for College-Age:
- Mix of current students, recent grads, early dropouts
- Content themes: Student debt anxiety, alternative success stories, remote work
- Skills focus: Coding, digital marketing, design with clear career outcomes
- Influencer types: "College dropout turned successful" narratives

Now for Corporate L&D (35-55) - you mentioned HR and L&D decision-makers, but B2B buying committees are complex. Are you targeting the end user (L&D managers), budget holder (CHROs), or influencer (department heads requesting training)? And what company sizes and industries are your sweet spot for that $10-50K deal range?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Excellent targeting clarity. Companies at 1,000-10,000 employees in tech, financial services, and healthcare with acute skills gaps - that's a well-defined ICP.

Corporate L&D targeting:
- Company size: 1,000-10,000 employees
- Industries: Tech, financial services, healthcare
- Primary targets: L&D managers/directors (researchers/business case builders)
- Secondary: CHROs (budget holders), department heads (initiators)
- Deal size: $10-50K for 50-500 seats

Now for geography. You mentioned tech hubs for career changers and corporate HQ cities for L&D. Let's get specific on budget allocation by geography.

For your $1.25M career changer budget targeting SF, Seattle, Austin, NYC, Boston, Denver - should we weight toward higher-cost markets like SF/NYC where competition is fierce but audience concentration is highest, or spread more evenly across all six markets?

Turn 10:
Smart allocation. SF/NYC will likely run 2-3x higher CPMs than Denver, but your logic on audience concentration and purchasing power is sound.

Career Changer geo allocation:
- SF/NYC: 40% = $500K (high cost, high volume, high purchasing power)
- Seattle/Austin/Boston: 35% = $437K (moderate cost, good volume)
- Denver: 25% = $313K (lower cost, emerging market)

For Corporate L&D at $3M budget targeting national corporate HQ cities - are you thinking broad national reach, or should we concentrate on major metros like NYC, Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas where Fortune 1000 headquarters cluster? The ABM approach suggests focusing budget on fewer, high-concentration markets rather than spreading thin.

Turn 11:
Excellent strategic thinking. Deep penetration in 6-8 metros will deliver much better frequency and brand presence than broad national spread.

Corporate L&D geo concentration:
- NYC, Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas (Fortune HQ clusters)
- SF, Seattle (tech hub mid-size companies)
- 2 additional metros for 8 total - Boston for financial services and maybe DC for government contractors?

$3M across 8 metros = ~$375K per market for sustained 4-6 month cycle coverage.

Now let's tackle budget allocation by value proposition. Each segment needs distinct messaging:
- Career Changers: Skills gap closure, advancement opportunity
- College-Age: Alternative path validation, debt-free career building  
- Corporate L&D: Skills gap solutions, workforce development ROI

Should we develop separate creative campaigns for each, or can we create modular messaging that adapts across segments while maintaining cost efficiency?

Turn 12:
Perfect decision. Three distinct creative campaigns will dramatically outperform generic messaging given how different these audiences are.

Creative investment breakdown:
- Career Changers: Professional advancement, skills-to-promotion connection
- College-Age: Alternative success validation, debt-free career stories  
- Corporate L&D: ROI data, workforce development case studies

Budget allocation summary:
- Corporate L&D: $3M (60%) across 8 metros, ABM approach
- Career Changers: $1.25M (25%) weighted to SF/NYC tech hubs
- College-Age: $750K (15%) national with urban/college town focus

Total: $5M for 32,500 leads targeting $15M+ revenue

Now for channel strategy. Given your sophisticated multi-segment approach, let's start with Corporate L&D since it's your largest investment. For that $3M budget targeting L&D decision-makers in 8 metros with 4-6 month sales cycles, what's your current channel mix, and where do you see the biggest opportunities?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 13:
Excellent channel evolution. Your current 60% LinkedIn weighting likely creates frequency saturation without expanding reach.

Proposed Corporate L&D mix:
- LinkedIn: 40% = $1.2M (sustained presence, thought leadership)
- Trade Publications: 30% = $900K (research-mode audience capture)
- ABM/Direct: 20% = $600K (pipeline-specific targeting)
- Events: 10% = $300K (relationship building, demos)

This diversification addresses the attribution gap we discussed earlier - trade pubs and ABM will drive unmeasured top-funnel influence that LinkedIn last-touch gets credit for.

For Career Changers with $1.25M budget, LinkedIn makes sense but what about podcast advertising? You mentioned they're heavy business/tech podcast listeners. Podcast ads could capture them during commute/workout when they're thinking about career growth, separate from their professional LinkedIn browsing.

What's your current career changer channel mix, and how important is podcast reach for this segment?

Turn 14:
Smart rebalancing. Over-saturating LinkedIn misses the aspirational moments when career decisions actually happen.

Career Changer mix ($1.25M):
- LinkedIn: 40% = $500K (professional context, targeting precision)  
- Podcasts: 30% = $375K (aspirational moments, commute/workout reach)
- Search: 20% = $250K (active research capture)
- Programmatic: 10% = $125K (retargeting, cross-device reach)

Podcast measurement is challenging, but you're right - better to reach them authentically than over-index on measurable but saturated channels. Consider unique landing pages and phone numbers for podcast attribution even if tracking is imperfect.

For College-Age with $750K budget, TikTok and Instagram are obvious, but what about YouTube? Gen Z spends massive time there, and you could leverage those "college dropout success story" influencers more cost-effectively than TikTok's premium creator rates.

What's your thinking on the college-age channel split between the major social platforms?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 15:
Perfect channel strategy. Authentic micro-influencer stories will massively outperform polished brand content for this validation-seeking audience.

College-Age mix ($750K):
- TikTok: 40% = $300K (immediate engagement, trend capture)
- YouTube: 30% = $225K (long-form success stories, cost-efficient influencers)
- Instagram: 20% = $150K (visual transformations, portfolio showcases)
- Cross-platform influencers: 10% = $75K (amplification across channels)

The "landed six-figure jobs without degrees" narrative is powerful social proof for overcoming traditional education bias.

For measurement across all segments, given your attribution limitations and varying sales cycles, what's your primary success metric? Revenue attribution will be messy with 4-6 month B2B cycles and social platform tracking gaps. 

Are you planning to measure each segment differently, or use a blended approach like cost per qualified lead with different qualification criteria per segment?
