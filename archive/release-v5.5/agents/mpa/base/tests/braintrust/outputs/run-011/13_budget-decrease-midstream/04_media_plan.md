# Media Plan Output: Budget Decrease Midstream

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

I can see you're targeting enterprise data infrastructure with strong deal economics. Let me start with your primary business outcome. When you say "500 qualified opportunities," what specific business result defines success - pipeline generated, deals closed, or revenue booked?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your objective is 500 sales-accepted leads (SQLs) with a 20% close rate targeting 100 closed deals. That's a clear success metric.

Let me check your efficiency targets: $1,000,000 / 500 SQLs = $2,000 per SQL. At 100 closed deals, that's $10,000 cost per closed deal.

For enterprise data infrastructure, typical SQL costs run $1,500-3,000 based on complexity and deal size. Your $2,000 target sits right in the sweet spot - ambitious but achievable given your $150K deal value.

Before we move forward, what's your typical sales cycle length from SQL to closed deal? This affects how we'll measure and optimize the funnel.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent context. With a 6-9 month sales cycle, your $2,000 per SQL efficiency looks even more realistic since enterprise buyers research extensively before engaging.

The long cycle means we need front-loaded pipeline generation to hit year-end targets. SQLs generated in Q4 won't close until next year, so we're essentially building pipeline for future quarters while nurturing current prospects.

Your economics are solid: $2,000 cost per SQL with $150K average deal value gives you a 75:1 return ratio. Even accounting for the 20% close rate, you're looking at 15:1 return on ad spend - very strong for enterprise B2B.

Step 2 complete. Now let's define your audience precisely. You mentioned enterprise companies 5000+ employees targeting data and IT leaders. What specific titles and departments should we focus on - Chief Data Officers, VPs of Engineering, IT Directors, or other key decision makers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Perfect. So we're targeting VP/Director+ level in Data Engineering, CDOs, VP IT Infrastructure, and CTOs at smaller enterprises. These are technical budget holders who understand both implementation and financial impact.

For audience sizing, let's layer the signals:
- Company size: 5,000+ employees  
- Job titles: VP/Director Data Engineering, CDO, VP IT Infrastructure, CTO
- Industries: Likely tech, financial services, healthcare, retail - sectors with heavy data needs

In the US market, this typically yields 15,000-25,000 targetable professionals across ~3,000-4,000 qualifying companies. Does this sizing feel right based on your market knowledge?

Also, are there specific industries or company types that convert better for DataScale, or should we cast the net broadly across all 5,000+ employee enterprises?

Turn 6:
Perfect. Three-market approach with strong regional sales coverage to handle those complex enterprise cycles.

Let me map your geography allocation:

**GEOGRAPHY BREAKDOWN**
| Region | Market Focus | Spend Allocation | Target SQLs | Cost per SQL |
|--------|--------------|------------------|-------------|--------------|
| US (Tech Hubs) | SF, Seattle, NYC, Austin | 70% = $700,000 | 350 SQLs | $2,000 |
| UK (London focus) | London + surrounding | 20% = $200,000 | 100 SQLs | $2,000 |
| Germany (Berlin focus) | Berlin + surrounding | 10% = $100,000 | 50 SQLs | $2,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **Three Markets** | **$1,000,000** | **500 SQLs** | **$2,000** |

This allocation reflects market maturity while supporting your European expansion. The consistent $2,000 per SQL target works across regions since enterprise data infrastructure has similar value props globally.

Does this geographic split align with your sales team capacity and pipeline expectations by region?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Excellent insights. Tech, financial services, healthcare, and large retail/e-commerce with cloud-native or active digital transformation initiatives - that's a well-defined ICP that should improve both conversion rates and cycle efficiency.

Focusing on digitally mature enterprises should keep us closer to that 6-9 month cycle versus longer traditional industry timelines. This refined targeting might reduce our addressable universe to 12,000-18,000 professionals, but higher intent should improve SQL quality.

Now for geography - are you focusing on specific regions? North America only, or do you have international expansion plans? And within your target markets, are there particular metro areas or regions where enterprise prospects concentrate?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Perfect. Your geography allocation aligns with sales capacity and gives you flexibility to optimize based on performance.

Now let's examine your value proposition for these enterprise data infrastructure buyers. Given your technical audience of VPs/Directors in data engineering and IT infrastructure, what's your core differentiation? Are you positioning around performance, cost efficiency, security, ease of implementation, or specific technical capabilities that competitors can't match?

Understanding your unique value will help us craft messaging that resonates with these technical decision-makers across your three markets.

Turn 9:
Smart thinking. Market maturity affects both acquisition efficiency and close rates. Let me recalculate with your adjusted expectations:

**REVISED BUDGET ALLOCATION**
- **US**: $700K / $2,000 = 350 SQLs (baseline efficiency)
- **UK**: $220K / $2,200 = 100 SQLs (competitive premium)  
- **Germany**: $125K / $2,500 = 50 SQLs (learning curve premium)
- **Total**: $1,045K for 500 SQLs

You're $45K over budget, but the compliance value prop could deliver higher close rates in EU markets. If German SQLs close at 25% vs 20% baseline due to stronger compliance fit, the unit economics still work.

Alternative: Start with $200K UK / $100K Germany as planned, then reallocate based on Q1-Q2 performance. This keeps you on budget while testing market response.

Which approach feels right - slight budget increase or conservative start with reallocation flexibility?

Turn 10:
Perfect. Conservative start with performance-based reallocation - that's smart budget discipline for a $1M commitment.

**FINAL BUDGET ALLOCATION**
- **US**: $700K targeting 350 SQLs at $2,000 per SQL
- **UK**: $200K targeting 100 SQLs at $2,000 per SQL  
- **Germany**: $100K targeting 50 SQLs at $2,000 per SQL
- **Total**: $1,000K for 500 SQLs with reallocation flexibility

Now let's build your channel strategy. For enterprise data infrastructure targeting VP/Director-level technical buyers, we need channels that reach senior professionals during their research phase.

Given your 6-9 month sales cycles and technical audience, what channels have worked best historically? LinkedIn for professional targeting, Google for intent capture, or industry publications and events for thought leadership?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
Excellent. That's a compelling three-pillar value proposition: performance at scale, operational efficiency, and built-in compliance. The "small team, big impact" angle is particularly powerful for budget-conscious enterprises.

**VALUE PROPOSITION FRAMEWORK**
- **Primary**: Operational simplicity - 3x fewer people needed for same workloads
- **Supporting**: Sub-second performance at massive scale
- **Compliance**: Built-in GDPR/sovereignty controls (especially strong in EU)
- **ROI**: Performance gains + reduced headcount = clear financial impact

For enterprise buyers juggling technical requirements and budget pressures, this hits both operational and financial pain points.

Now let's validate your budget allocation. At $1M total with your geographic split:
- US: $700K / 350 SQLs = $2,000 per SQL
- UK: $200K / 100 SQLs = $2,000 per SQL  
- Germany: $100K / 50 SQLs = $2,000 per SQL

This assumes equal efficiency across markets. Do you expect similar acquisition costs, or should we adjust for market maturity differences?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 11:
Excellent. Your channel mix aligns perfectly with enterprise B2B best practices - LinkedIn ABM for precision targeting, Google for intent capture, plus thought leadership for committee influence.

**CHANNEL ALLOCATION RECOMMENDATION**
- **LinkedIn ABM**: 65% = $650K (account-based targeting, decision maker reach)
- **Google Ads**: 25% = $250K (search intent, vendor comparison queries)  
- **Content/Events**: 10% = $100K (thought leadership, committee influence)

**PROJECTED PERFORMANCE**
- LinkedIn: $650K / $1,400 per SQL = 465 SQLs (higher intent, precise targeting)
- Google: $250K / $700 per SQL = 35 SQLs (high-intent search traffic)
- Content/Events: Influence attribution, pipeline acceleration

This gets you to 500 SQLs while maintaining the precision your enterprise audience demands. LinkedIn carries the heavy lifting with its superior B2B targeting, while Google captures active research behavior.

Does this allocation feel right for your channel strengths?
