# Media Plan Output: Timeline Compression

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your efficiency target. $1,200,000 / 25,000 = $48 per customer acquisition cost (CAC). With $180 LTV, that's a 3.75x LTV:CAC ratio - very strong for fashion retail where 3-4x is typical.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve beyond customer acquisition? Are you focused on revenue growth, market expansion, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Revenue growth through market expansion with customer acquisition as the driver. 

With 25,000 new customers at $180 LTV, this projects to $4.5M in new customer revenue ($25,000 × $180 = $4,500,000). That's a strong 3.75x return on your $1.2M investment.

How do you measure success? What's your primary KPI - is it the 25,000 customer count, the $4.5M revenue target, or do you track a different metric like monthly recurring customers or market share percentage?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - 25,000 customers as the primary KPI with quality guardrails through LTV tracking. Your 22,000+ floor shows good strategic thinking.

Your $48 CAC target is achievable for fashion retail. Industry benchmarks typically run $35-65 for direct-to-consumer fashion, so you're well within range.

One quick economics check: when you say $180 LTV, what timeframe does that cover? Is that first-year value, 24-month LTV, or lifetime? This affects how we think about payback periods and cash flow for your expansion into new markets.

Turn 4:
Perfect! 24-month LTV of $180 gives us a solid foundation. At $85-90 average order value, that implies roughly 2 purchases per customer over 24 months - strong repeat behavior for fashion retail.

Your $48 CAC with 24-month payback is very reasonable. Most fashion brands see payback within 12-18 months, so you have good cushion.

Now let's move to audience definition. You mentioned expanding into tier 2 cities for urban fashion. Who is your ideal customer? Can you describe the demographics, lifestyle, or shopping behaviors that define your target audience?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Excellent profile! Fashion-forward women 25-45, college-educated professionals who value versatile, quality pieces. The tier 2 insight about price consciousness is valuable for messaging.

Let me get more specific for targeting precision. Within that 25-45 age range, do you see stronger performance in any particular age segments? And for income, what household income range typically converts best for your $85-90 average order values?

Also, when you say "tier 2 cities," which specific markets are you targeting for expansion?

Turn 6:
Perfect targeting clarity! Women 28-35, $60K-$120K household income in growth markets - that's a precise audience definition.

Austin, Nashville, Denver, and Portland are smart choices - strong professional growth and fashion culture without major market saturation.

Let me model your audience sizing. In those four DMAs plus your current markets, women 28-35 with $60K+ household income typically represent about 8-12% of total population. 

Which current markets are you already established in? I need to understand your existing footprint to properly size the total addressable audience and allocate your 25,000 customer target between current and expansion markets.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Great allocation strategy! 15,000 from established markets, 10,000 from tier 2 expansion. That 60/40 split balances growth with expansion risk.

Your established markets (NYC, LA, Chicago, SF, Miami, Seattle) have deep audience pools. The tier 2 markets will need more focused targeting since you're building from zero brand awareness.

This split affects your budget efficiency: $1,200,000 / 15,000 established = $80 per customer vs. $1,200,000 / 10,000 new markets = $120 per customer. New market CACs typically run 40-60% higher due to lower brand recognition.

Are you comfortable with that efficiency difference, or should we adjust the allocation? Your overall blended CAC stays at $48, but the underlying economics vary significantly by market type.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Excellent strategic thinking! Treating tier 2 expansion as a brand-building investment with improving efficiency over time is spot-on.

Let me confirm your budget allocation: 
- Established markets: 15,000 customers × $80 = $1,200,000 × 62.5% = $750,000
- Tier 2 expansion: 10,000 customers × $120 = $1,200,000 × 37.5% = $450,000

Total: $1,200,000 for 25,000 customers = $48 blended CAC

This allocation gives you substantial investment in new markets while maintaining growth in established ones. The $450,000 for tier 2 should provide enough budget to build awareness and optimize across four markets.

Now for your value proposition: How should your messaging differ between established markets where you have brand recognition versus tier 2 markets where you're introducing the brand?

Turn 9:
Perfect messaging strategy! Product-focused for established markets leveraging existing equity, lifestyle-driven for tier 2 with emphasis on versatility and value.

The "office to after-work" positioning is smart for professional women in growth cities. Educational content about quality and fit builds trust when brand reputation isn't established yet.

Now let's map channels to these objectives. For established markets with purchase intent focus, you'll likely lean toward lower-funnel channels. For tier 2 brand introduction, you'll need upper-funnel awareness builders.

What channels are currently driving your best performance in established markets? And do you have any initial thoughts on how to reach professional women 28-35 in the tier 2 cities where you're starting from zero awareness?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Excellent channel thinking! Instagram and Google working well in established markets makes perfect sense for your audience. TikTok growth with younger demos is valuable.

Your tier 2 strategy is sound - upper funnel social for awareness, broader Google keywords for category capture. Facebook for professional women 28-35 in smaller markets is smart targeting.

Let me model your channel allocation:

**Established markets ($750K):**
- Google Search: ~40% = $300K (strong intent capture)
- Instagram: ~35% = $262K (existing engagement) 
- TikTok: ~25% = $188K (growing performance)

**Tier 2 expansion ($450K):**
- Instagram/TikTok: ~60% = $270K (awareness building)
- Facebook: ~25% = $112K (professional targeting)
- Google (category keywords): ~15% = $68K (intent capture)

Does this allocation align with your thinking, or would you adjust the percentages?
