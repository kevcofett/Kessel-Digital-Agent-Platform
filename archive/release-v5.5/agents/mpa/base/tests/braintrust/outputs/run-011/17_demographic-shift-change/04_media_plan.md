# Media Plan Output: Demographic Shift Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your efficiency calculation: $1.5M / 100K customers = $15 per customer. At $350 LTV, that's a 23:1 return ratio - very strong economics for streetwear acquisition.

Your target is highly achievable. Streetwear brands typically see $12-25 acquisition costs for Millennials, so you're right in the sweet spot.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 100K new customers - is this about revenue growth, market share expansion, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Revenue growth plus market expansion gives us clear direction. Let me confirm your primary success metric.

With 100K new customers at $350 LTV, you're projecting $35M in customer lifetime value from this campaign. At $1.5M investment, that's a 23:1 return.

Is your primary KPI the 100K new customers acquired, or would you prefer to track total revenue generated from these acquisitions? Both work, but it affects how we measure and optimize throughout the year.

Turn 3:
Excellent - 100K new customers as your primary KPI with revenue as a secondary metric gives us clear measurement focus.

Your economics are solid: $1.5M / 100K = $15 per customer against $350 LTV. This 23:1 ratio is very achievable for streetwear targeting Millennials, where typical acquisition costs run $12-25.

Now let's define your audience precisely. You mentioned Millennials 25-40 into streetwear and urban fashion. Beyond age and style interest, what other signals help identify your ideal customer - income level, lifestyle behaviors, shopping patterns, or brand affinities that distinguish your buyers from general streetwear shoppers?

Turn 4:
Perfect audience profile! Income $50-75K, socially active early adopters who follow streetwear influencers and value authenticity. The brand affinity to Stussy, Kith, and Fear of God Essentials gives us clear targeting signals.

At $15 per customer with this well-defined audience, your efficiency target becomes even more achievable. Social-first Millennials in that income bracket typically convert well for authentic streetwear brands.

You mentioned top 25 DMAs - are there specific markets where you're currently underrepresented that you want to prioritize, or should we weight the budget evenly across all 25 markets based on population and streetwear culture density?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 6:
Got it. I'll model using top streetwear markets based on culture density and Millennial concentration. You can refine this list anytime.

Recommended 25 DMAs for streetwear targeting:

**Strong Markets (40% = $600K):**
LA, NYC, Atlanta

**Underrepresented Priority Markets (60% = $900K):**
Chicago, Dallas, Miami, San Francisco, DC, Boston, Seattle, Portland, Denver, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Houston, Philadelphia, Detroit, Minneapolis, Orlando, San Diego, Oakland, Austin, Charlotte, Nashville, Tampa

This mix balances major metros with emerging streetwear scenes and strong Millennial populations.

Now let's move to budget allocation. You have $1.5M total with geographic split defined. How do you want to allocate between acquisition of new customers versus retention/growth of existing customers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Smart strategy - 60% to underrepresented markets like Chicago, Dallas, Miami for expansion, 40% to maintain growth in LA, NYC, Atlanta strongholds.

$1.5M budget splits to:
- 60% = $900K for underrepresented markets (60K customers)  
- 40% = $600K for strong markets (40K customers)

Both maintain your $15 per customer efficiency target.

To build the complete geography table, I need the full list of your top 25 DMAs. You've mentioned 6 markets - can you provide the remaining 19 DMAs you want to target, or should I recommend the top streetwear markets based on culture density and Millennial population?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Perfect allocation - 85% acquisition-focused aligns with your 100K new customer goal.

$1.5M budget breakdown:
- 85% = $1.275M for new customer acquisition (100K customers)
- 15% = $225K for existing customer growth

This gives you $1.275M / 100K = $12.75 per new customer acquisition cost, which is even stronger than our original $15 target and well within streetwear benchmarks.

The $225K retention budget can drive repeat purchases and increase customer lifetime value beyond the $350 baseline.

What's your brand's core value proposition that differentiates UrbanStyle Collective from competitors like Stussy and Kith in the minds of these social-savvy Millennials?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Excellent positioning - "authentic street culture meets accessible luxury" with emerging artist collaborations and versatile elevated basics. That value prop resonates perfectly with your $50-75K income Millennials who want quality without hype beast pricing.

The discovery aspect and artist collaborations should perform especially well on Instagram and TikTok where your audience finds new brands.

Now let's build your channel strategy. With $1.275M for acquisition targeting social-savvy Millennials who discover brands through Instagram/TikTok, what channels are you currently using, and are there any you definitely want to include or avoid in this plan?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Perfect foundation - Instagram and TikTok align with your discovery-focused audience, and micro-influencer partnerships support your authentic positioning.

Given your $12.75 acquisition target and social-discovery audience, I recommend this channel mix:

**Primary Channels (70% = $892K):**
- Instagram/Meta: 40% = $510K (broad reach + retargeting)
- TikTok: 20% = $255K (discovery + younger Millennials) 
- Influencer partnerships: 10% = $127K (authenticity + trust)

**Supporting Channels (30% = $383K):**
- Google Search: 15% = $191K (capture intent)
- YouTube: 10% = $127K (video storytelling)
- Spotify/Audio: 5% = $64K (lifestyle targeting)

This prioritizes social discovery while capturing intent and building brand story. Each channel needs $100K+ minimum for proper optimization.

Does this mix align with your vision, or would you adjust any allocations?

Turn 10:
Excellent point! You're absolutely right - with limited brand awareness, search volume will be constrained. Influencer partnerships are much more strategic for discovery in new markets.

Revised channel mix:

**Primary Channels (75% = $956K):**
- Instagram/Meta: 40% = $510K (broad reach + retargeting)
- TikTok: 20% = $255K (discovery + younger Millennials)
- Influencer partnerships: 15% = $191K (authenticity + market entry)

**Supporting Channels (25% = $319K):**
- Google Search: 10% = $127K (capture existing intent)
- YouTube: 10% = $127K (video storytelling)
- Spotify/Audio: 5% = $64K (lifestyle targeting)

This gives you $191K for influencer partnerships - enough for 50-75 micro-influencers across your 25 markets. Much better for breaking into Chicago, Dallas, Miami where authentic local discovery matters most.

How will you measure success beyond the 100K customer count - what secondary metrics matter most for tracking campaign performance?

Turn 11:
Excellent measurement framework! Those metrics will give you clear optimization signals and quality indicators beyond just volume.

Key measurement setup:
- **Primary KPI:** 100K new customers 
- **Efficiency:** CPA by channel (target $12.75 average)
- **Quality:** 30-day repeat purchase rate + AOV by channel
- **Market Expansion:** Brand awareness lift in underrepresented DMAs
- **Engagement:** Platform-specific engagement rates

For tracking brand awareness lift in new markets, consider quarterly brand tracking surveys. For channel CPA, ensure you're measuring incrementality, not just platform-reported attribution - especially important with your multi-channel social approach.

What testing approach do you want to take? With $1.275M across 6 channels and 25 markets, we can run meaningful tests to optimize your mix throughout the year.

Turn 12:
Smart testing strategy! Geographic and influencer approach tests will give you actionable optimization data quickly.

**Q1 Testing Framework:**
- **Market Entry Test:** Compare 70% social vs 50% social mix in similar underrepresented DMAs (Chicago vs Dallas)
- **Influencer Scale Test:** Micro-influencers (5K-50K followers) vs mid-tier (50K-200K) in matched markets
- **Platform Learning:** TikTok creative formats and posting strategies

Build in 15-20% budget flexibility between channels based on Q1 learnings. This lets you reallocate $190K-255K toward top performers.

Finally, what risks concern you most about this plan? Market competition, platform changes, influencer availability, or economic factors that could impact your $12.75 CPA target or 100K customer goal?

Turn 13:
Excellent risk assessment! Those are the exact concerns that could derail your plan.

**Risk Mitigation Strategy:**

**Platform Algorithm Risk:**
- Diversify creative formats across Instagram/TikTok
- Maintain 25% budget in non-social channels as hedge
- Build owned audience through email/SMS capture

**Influencer Cost Inflation:**
- Lock early partnerships with performance clauses
- Develop direct creator relationships vs agency markups
- Test employee advocacy and UGC as alternatives

**Economic Downturn Risk:**
- Monitor leading indicators (consumer confidence, discretionary spending)
- Prepare value messaging for price-conscious periods
- Build budget reallocation scenarios if CPA targets spike

Your $12.75 CPA target has 40%+ cushion vs $18-20 recession benchmarks, giving you room to maintain volume even if costs rise.

We've covered all ten areas! You have a solid plan: $1.275M acquisition budget, 6-channel mix focused on social discovery, geographic testing for optimization, and clear risk mitigation. Ready to build this into a detailed execution timeline?
