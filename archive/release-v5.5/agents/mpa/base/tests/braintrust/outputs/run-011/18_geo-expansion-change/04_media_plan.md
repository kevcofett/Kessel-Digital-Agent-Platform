# Media Plan Output: Geography Expansion Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your business outcome. You mentioned driving 500,000 store visits and online conversions combined. To clarify the success measurement - are you optimizing for total visits/conversions, or is there a specific revenue target behind those 500,000 interactions?

Turn 2:
Great question! Working backwards from revenue is actually the stronger approach. It ensures your volume targets connect to business impact.

With $180 average order value, let me ask: what revenue target would make this campaign a clear win for ActiveWear Pro? 

Once we have that number, we can calculate: Revenue Target ÷ $180 = Customer Target, then assess if $2.5M budget can efficiently deliver that volume.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Let's do the math on that efficiency:

**At $15M revenue target:**
$2.5M budget ÷ 83,000 customers = $30 per customer

**At $20M revenue target:**
$2.5M budget ÷ 111,000 customers = $23 per customer

These are very aggressive efficiency targets for athletic apparel. Industry benchmarks typically run $45-80 per customer for this vertical. At $23-30, you'd need to significantly outperform market norms.

A few reality-check questions: Do you have strong first-party data or email lists to leverage? And with $180 average order value, what's your typical profit margin per sale? This will help us assess if these efficiency targets are achievable or if we should adjust the revenue goal.

Turn 5:
Perfect! $10M revenue with 55,600 customers at $45 per customer gives us a solid foundation to build on.

Now let's define your target audience more precisely. You mentioned active adults 25-45, but with a $45 efficiency target, we need to be strategic about who we prioritize.

Within that 25-45 age range, what defines your highest-value customers? Are you seeing better performance from certain income levels, fitness activities, or lifestyle characteristics? The tighter we can define your core audience, the better our chances of hitting that $45 target.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Good reality check! At 40-45% gross margin, you have solid unit economics to work with.

Let's model a more realistic scenario:

**Conservative approach (market-typical efficiency):**
$2.5M budget ÷ $60 per customer = 41,700 customers
41,700 × $180 AOV = $7.5M revenue

**Optimistic but achievable approach:**
$2.5M budget ÷ $45 per customer = 55,600 customers  
55,600 × $180 AOV = $10M revenue

The $10M target at $45 per customer is ambitious but doable with your email list as a foundation and tight execution. Your 40-45% margin ($72-81 profit per $180 sale) gives you room to invest in acquisition.

Does a $10M revenue target / 55,600 customer goal feel like a meaningful win for ActiveWear Pro? Or would you prefer to start more conservatively at the $7.5M level?

Turn 6:
Excellent - that's a much more defined audience. Let me capture the key signals:

**Demographics:** Ages 28-40, $75K+ household income
**Behavioral:** Work out 4-5x weekly, CrossFit/running/yoga participants  
**Psychographic:** Multi-activity fitness enthusiasts (outdoor + gym)
**Geographic:** Metro areas and suburbs with strong fitness culture

This hybrid indoor/outdoor fitness profile is smart - those customers buying for multiple activities definitely drive higher AOV.

For geography, are there specific metro markets where ActiveWear Pro already has strong brand presence or retail locations? Starting with markets where you have physical stores could help with both online conversions and store visits, plus give us attribution advantages.

Turn 7:
Smart approach - leveraging your retail footprint will definitely help with attribution and local amplification.

Let me map out your core markets and get a sense of the audience scale we're working with:

**Primary Markets (strong retail presence):**
- Los Angeles, San Diego (CA)
- NYC metro, Boston (Northeast) 
- Dallas, Austin (TX)
- Denver, Seattle

**Question:** Are there any other markets in California, Texas, or the Northeast where you have stores that I should include? And roughly how many total markets should we prioritize - are we looking at 8-12 DMAs, or should we cast wider to maybe 15-20 markets?

With your 55,600 customer target, I want to make sure we have enough audience scale in these priority markets to hit our efficiency goals.

Turn 8:
Let me calculate the audience scale in your 12 strongest DMAs to see if we have enough reach:

**Core 12 DMAs:** LA, San Diego, San Francisco, Sacramento, NYC, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington DC, Dallas, Austin, Houston, Denver, Seattle

With your target profile (ages 28-40, $75K+ income, active fitness enthusiasts), these 12 markets should provide roughly 8-12 million people who fit your demographic criteria. Your behavioral filters (workout 4-5x weekly, multi-activity fitness) will narrow that significantly - likely to 800K-1.2M highly qualified prospects.

For 55,600 customers, that means reaching about 5-7% of your target audience - very achievable without oversaturating these markets.

Going deep in your retail markets is definitely the right strategy. You'll get better attribution, local store amplification, and can optimize for both online and in-store conversions.

Should we lock in these 12 DMAs as your geographic focus, or do any of these markets feel less critical than others?

Turn 9:
Perfect! 12 DMAs locked in with 800K-1.2M qualified prospects supporting your 55,600 customer target.

Now let's talk budget allocation. With $2.5M total budget, we need to decide how to split between:

**Customer acquisition** (new customers you've never reached)
vs.
**Customer reactivation** (winning back past customers and engaging your email list)

Your 150K email subscribers are much cheaper to convert than cold prospects. Typically I see 70-80% allocated to acquisition and 20-30% to reactivation, but given your aggressive $45 efficiency target, we might want more budget toward that lower-cost email audience.

What's your instinct on the acquisition vs. reactivation split?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 10:
That 60/40 split is smart given your efficiency targets. Let me show you the math:

**Acquisition budget:** 60% of $2.5M = $1.5M
**Reactivation budget:** 40% of $2.5M = $1M

For the $1.5M acquisition budget targeting new customers:
$1.5M ÷ $60-70 per customer (realistic for cold prospects) = 21,400-25,000 new customers

For the $1M reactivation budget with your email list:
$1M ÷ $20-30 per customer (email/retargeting rates) = 33,300-50,000 reactivated customers

**Total:** 54,700-75,000 customers - right in your target range of 55,600!

This allocation leverages your underutilized email asset while still investing meaningfully in growth. Past customers likely do have higher AOVs too.

The 60/40 split looks solid. Should we lock this in, or do you want to model a more aggressive 50/50 split?

Turn 11:
Excellent! Budget allocation locked: $1.5M acquisition / $1M reactivation targeting 55,600 customers for $10M revenue.

Now let's define your value proposition. With athletic apparel being competitive, we need clear messaging that resonates with your multi-activity fitness enthusiasts.

What makes ActiveWear Pro different from competitors like Lululemon, Nike, or Under Armour? Is it performance features, price point, style, or something else that drives your best customers to choose you over alternatives?

Understanding your unique positioning will help us craft messaging that converts efficiently at that $45 target.

Turn 12:
Perfect positioning - "one wardrobe for every workout" is compelling for your multi-activity audience. The Nike-to-Lululemon price bridge with technical performance is a strong value prop.

**Core messaging framework:**
- **Functional benefit:** Versatile gear that performs across activities (yoga to HIIT to outdoor runs)
- **Emotional benefit:** Simplify your fitness life - one wardrobe, endless possibilities  
- **Economic benefit:** Premium performance without premium prices

**Key proof points:** Compression + moisture-wicking, gym-to-outdoor transitions, technical features at accessible pricing

This should resonate well with your 28-40, $75K+ audience who values both performance and smart spending.

For creative execution, should we emphasize the multi-activity versatility (showing same piece across different workouts) or focus more on the performance-to-price value story? Your reactivation emails might lean different than cold acquisition ads.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 13:
Brilliant strategy - lead with differentiation for acquisition, then focus on product depth for reactivation. That versatility story is your unique hook.

**Acquisition creative direction:** Multi-activity hero shots showing same garment across yoga → CrossFit → trail running
**Reactivation creative direction:** New arrivals, seasonal drops, performance upgrades for existing customers

Now let's build your channel strategy. With $1.5M acquisition and $1M reactivation budgets across 12 DMAs, we need channels that can efficiently reach your active fitness audience.

For acquisition, what channels has ActiveWear Pro used before, and which have performed best? I'm thinking about platforms like Meta (Instagram/Facebook), Google, potentially Connected TV, but want to understand your experience first.

Turn 14:
Smart to question the channel mix with CPAs creeping up on Google. Let me break this down by your budgets:

**For $1M reactivation:** Email marketing, Meta retargeting, and Google remarketing are perfect - stick with what works for past customers.

**For $1.5M acquisition, I'd recommend this split:**
- **Meta (Instagram focus): 40% = $600K** - Your proven winner for visual storytelling
- **Google Search + Shopping: 30% = $450K** - Capture demand efficiently  
- **YouTube: 20% = $300K** - Video perfect for multi-activity demos
- **Connected TV: 10% = $150K** - Reach fitness enthusiasts during sports/wellness programming

**On TikTok:** Your 28-40 audience is actually quite active there, especially the fitness community. But with your $45 efficiency target, I'd test TikTok in year two after optimizing these proven channels.

This diversifies beyond Meta/Google while staying in your demographic's media consumption habits. Does this allocation feel right, or should we adjust any percentages?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 15:
Good instinct! For Connected TV, 10% ($150K) is actually the minimum viable test for meaningful data. CTV requires sustained investment over 8-12 weeks to measure brand awareness lift, and at 5% you'd be too underfunded to reach proper frequency.

But I like your thinking on video. Here's an alternative split:

**Revised allocation:**
- Meta (Instagram focus): 35% = $525K  
- Google Search + Shopping: 30% = $450K
- YouTube: 25% = $375K
- Connected TV: 10% = $150K

This gives YouTube more firepower for your multi-activity demos while keeping CTV at the minimum viable level. The extra YouTube budget lets you test different video formats - short-form for acquisition, longer demos for consideration.

Since video storytelling aligns with your versatility message, this might actually deliver better efficiency than the original split. Does 25% on YouTube feel right, or should we stick with the first allocation?

Turn 16:
Perfect! Channel allocation locked:
- Meta (Instagram focus): $525K (35%)
- Google Search + Shopping: $450K (30%)  
- YouTube: $375K (25%)
- Connected TV: $150K (10%)

Now let's establish measurement. With your $45 efficiency target and both online + in-store goals, we need tracking that captures the full customer journey.

**Key question:** Do you currently have attribution tracking between your digital campaigns and in-store visits? This is critical since you want to drive both online conversions and store traffic.

Also, beyond the primary KPI of $45 cost per customer, what secondary metrics matter most to ActiveWear Pro - brand awareness lift, email sign-ups, repeat purchase rates, or something else?
