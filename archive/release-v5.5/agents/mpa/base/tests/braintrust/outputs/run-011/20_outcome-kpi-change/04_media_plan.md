# Media Plan Output: Outcome KPI Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I am excited to build a media plan with you. We will cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by calculating your implied efficiency: $5,000,000 / 25,000 = $200 per policy acquisition. With LTV at $2,800, your LTV/CAC ratio is 14x, which is excellent for insurance.

Your business outcome is clear - 25,000 new policy acquisitions. What specific KPI will you use to measure success beyond total policy count? For example, are you tracking qualified leads, applications started, or policies bound within a specific timeframe?

Turn 2:
Perfect! With your 15% conversion rate, you need 166,667 qualified leads to hit 25,000 policies - that math checks out. Your $200 CAC is conservative for insurance where industry benchmarks typically run $180-300 per policy.

Let me calculate your lead economics: $5,000,000 / 166,667 qualified leads = $30 per qualified lead. This is very achievable in insurance lead generation.

Your Step 1 outcomes are solid:
- Business objective: 25,000 new policy acquisitions  
- Primary KPI: 166,667 qualified leads
- Conversion assumption: 15% lead-to-policy rate

Now for Step 2 economics - I need to understand your unit economics better. What's your average policy premium or first-year revenue per customer? This will help validate whether $200 CAC maintains healthy margins against your $2,800 LTV.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent! Your economics are strong:
- $1,200 annual premium vs $200 CAC = 6:1 first-year ratio
- $30 per qualified lead vs current $40-45 = 25-33% efficiency improvement target
- 2.3 year average customer lifespan supporting $2,800 LTV

This efficiency target is achievable and represents meaningful improvement over current performance. Insurance lead costs have been rising, so hitting $30 CPL will require precise targeting and channel optimization.

Your Step 2 economics are validated. Now let's move to Step 3 - Audience definition.

You mentioned homeowners 35-65 with $100K+ income during life events. Let's get more specific about your highest-value segments. Which life event typically converts best for you - home purchase, new baby, or pre-retirement? This will help prioritize our targeting strategy.

Turn 4:
Perfect insight! Home purchase at 20% higher conversion means roughly 18% lead-to-policy rate vs 15% baseline. This significantly improves your economics:

For home purchase segment: $5M budget could yield fewer leads but more policies
- At 18% conversion: need only 138,889 qualified leads for 25,000 policies  
- Cost per lead could be $36 while maintaining $200 CAC target

This suggests prioritizing home purchase audiences heavily in your targeting strategy.

For audience sizing, homeowners 35-65 with $100K+ income is quite broad - likely 15-20M households nationally. But recent home purchasers (last 6-12 months) in that demo is much smaller - perhaps 800K-1.2M households annually.

What percentage of your 25,000 target should come from the high-converting home purchase segment versus new baby and pre-retirement? This will determine how much audience precision we need.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Smart geographic strategy! Let me model your core vs expansion approach:

**Priority States (FL, TX, GA, AZ, NC) - 55% allocation:**
- $2,750,000 budget allocation
- 15-20% lower lead costs = ~$29 CPL vs $36 target
- Should yield ~95,000 qualified leads = 17,100 policies (68% of target)

**Expansion Markets (CO, TN, others) - 45% allocation:**
- $2,250,000 budget allocation  
- At target $36 CPL = 62,500 qualified leads = 7,900 policies (32% of target)

This projects to 25,000 total policies while leveraging your operational advantages.

Let me build a DMA-level geography table to structure this properly. Which specific DMAs within your priority states perform best? For example, in Florida - are you stronger in Miami-Ft. Lauderdale, Tampa-St. Pete, or Orlando markets? This will help optimize the geographic allocation within each state.

Turn 7:
Perfect! Let me structure your geography plan with these high-performing DMAs. Here's your Step 4 geography allocation:

**GEOGRAPHY ALLOCATION TABLE - PHASE 1**

| Geography (DMA) | State | Total Population | Target Audience Size | Target Audience % | Priority Level |
|-----------------|-------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Tampa-St. Pete | FL | 3,200,000 | 480,000 | 15.0% | Core |
| Orlando | FL | 2,600,000 | 390,000 | 15.0% | Core |
| Dallas-Ft. Worth | TX | 7,800,000 | 1,170,000 | 15.0% | Core |
| Houston | TX | 7,200,000 | 1,080,000 | 15.0% | Core |
| Atlanta | GA | 6,100,000 | 915,000 | 15.0% | Core |
| Phoenix | AZ | 5,000,000 | 750,000 | 15.0% | Core |
| **Core DMAs Subtotal** | | **31,900,000** | **4,785,000** | **15.0%** | |
| Austin | TX | 2,400,000 | 360,000 | 15.0% | Expansion |
| Charlotte | NC | 2,800,000 | 420,000 | 15.0% | Expansion |
| Raleigh | NC | 1,400,000 | 210,000 | 15.0% | Expansion |
| Denver | CO | 3,000,000 | 450,000 | 15.0% | Expansion |
| Nashville | TN | 2,000,000 | 300,000 | 15.0% | Expansion |
| **Expansion DMAs Subtotal** | | **11,600,000** | **1,740,000** | **15.0%** | |
| **TOTAL** | | **43,500,000** | **6,525,000** | **15.0%** | |

Should we allocate 65% budget to Core DMAs and 35% to Expansion, given your stronger positioning in the core markets?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Excellent allocation strategy! Let me calculate the segment math:

**Home Purchase Segment (15,000 policies):**
- At 18% conversion: 15,000 / 0.18 = 83,333 qualified leads needed
- Budget allocation: 60% priority suggests ~$3M of $5M budget
- $3,000,000 / 83,333 = $36 per qualified lead (well within range)

**Other Segments (10,000 policies):**
- At 15% conversion: 10,000 / 0.15 = 66,667 qualified leads needed  
- Remaining $2M budget / 66,667 = $30 per qualified lead

The 800K-1.2M annual home purchaser audience provides solid scale without saturation risk.

Your Step 3 audience strategy is well-defined. Now for Step 4 - Geography. 

Are there specific states or regions where TrustGuard is particularly competitive, or where home purchase activity is strongest? Insurance regulations vary by state, so geographic prioritization could significantly impact your $36 CPL targets.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Perfect! Your geography allocation is set:

**BUDGET ALLOCATION BY GEOGRAPHY:**
- Core DMAs: 65% × $5,000,000 = $3,250,000
- Expansion DMAs: 35% × $5,000,000 = $1,750,000

**PROJECTED LEAD ECONOMICS:**
- Core markets at $29 CPL: $3,250,000 / $29 = 112,069 qualified leads
- Expansion markets at $36 CPL: $1,750,000 / $36 = 48,611 qualified leads  
- **Total: 160,680 qualified leads** (slightly below 166,667 target, but within range given conversion rate variations)

Your Step 4 geography strategy leverages operational strengths while building expansion capability.

Now for Step 5 - Budget allocation. Beyond the geographic split, how should we allocate budget between your three audience segments? Should the high-converting home purchase segment get proportionally more budget, or do you want to maintain the 60/40 split between home purchase versus new baby/pre-retirement?

Turn 9:
Excellent reallocation! Let me calculate your optimized budget structure:

**SEGMENT BUDGET ALLOCATION:**
- Home Purchase: 70% × $5,000,000 = $3,500,000
- New Baby: 15% × $5,000,000 = $750,000  
- Pre-retirement: 15% × $5,000,000 = $750,000

**PROJECTED PERFORMANCE BY SEGMENT:**
- Home Purchase: $3,500,000 / $36 CPL = 97,222 leads → 17,500 policies at 18% conversion
- New Baby: $750,000 / $30 CPL = 25,000 leads → 3,750 policies at 15% conversion  
- Pre-retirement: $750,000 / $30 CPL = 25,000 leads → 3,750 policies at 15% conversion
- **Total: 25,000 policies** (exactly on target!)

This allocation maximizes your high-converting segment while maintaining presence in other valuable audiences.

Now for Step 6 - Value Proposition. What key messages resonate most with recent home purchasers versus your other segments? Understanding this will help optimize creative and landing page strategies across your audience mix.

Turn 10:
Excellent messaging framework! Let me structure your value proposition by segment:

**VALUE PROPOSITION MATRIX:**

**Home Purchase (70% budget):**
- Primary: "Protect your new investment" + competitive rates
- Secondary: Coverage gap urgency during transition
- Proof points: Rate comparisons, switching ease
- CTA focus: Quote comparison, immediate coverage

**New Baby (15% budget):**
- Primary: "Now you have more to protect" + peace of mind
- Secondary: Life insurance bundling benefits
- Proof points: Family protection stories, bundle savings
- CTA focus: Family coverage assessment

**Pre-retirement (15% budget):**
- Primary: Financial security + legacy protection
- Secondary: Educational content on switching benefits
- Proof points: Customer testimonials, stability messaging
- CTA focus: Consultation request, educational resources

This messaging hierarchy should inform both creative development and landing page optimization across segments.

Now for Step 7 - Channels. Given your audience targeting needs (recent home purchasers, life events) and $30-36 CPL targets, which channels are you currently using, and where do you see the biggest opportunities for that 25-33% efficiency improvement?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Smart channel analysis! Let me map your current performance and opportunities:

**CURRENT CHANNEL MIX:**
- Paid Search: 60% of leads at $40-45 CPL (need to optimize to $30-36)
- Paid Social (Meta): Challenged by iOS changes
- Programmatic/CTV: Testing phase, not scaled

**EFFICIENCY OPPORTUNITIES:**
- Search optimization: Better keyword strategy + quality scores could drop CPL 20-25%
- Data targeting: Mortgage/real estate feeds for home purchase precision
- LinkedIn: Untapped for $100K+ income targeting  
- YouTube: Educational content for pre-retirement segment

Given your $5M budget and need for 160,680 qualified leads at blended $31 CPL, here's a strategic channel allocation:

Should we structure this as 50% Search (optimized), 25% Enhanced Data Targeting (programmatic + real estate feeds), 15% Social (Meta + LinkedIn), and 10% Video (YouTube + CTV) to balance proven performance with efficiency improvements?

Turn 12:
Perfect channel allocation! Let me finalize your Step 7 channel strategy:

**FINAL CHANNEL MIX & BUDGET:**

**Paid Search (50% - $2,500,000):**
- Google Ads: $2,000,000 
- Bing Ads: $500,000
- Focus: Keyword optimization, quality score improvement
- Target: $30-32 CPL (down from $40-45)

**Enhanced Data Targeting (25% - $1,250,000):**
- Mortgage/real estate data feeds: $900,000
- Programmatic display: $350,000  
- Focus: Recent home purchaser precision
- Target: $28-30 CPL with higher conversion rates

**Social (15% - $750,000):**
- LinkedIn: 10% = $500,000 (high-income targeting)
- Meta: 5% = $250,000 (new baby life events)
- Target: $32-35 CPL

**Video (10% - $500,000):**
- YouTube: $350,000 (educational content for pre-retirement)
- Connected TV: $150,000 (home purchase research phase)
- Target: $35-40 CPL with brand awareness lift

This mix prioritizes proven performance while building efficiency through better targeting.

Now for Step 8 - Measurement. Beyond qualified leads and policy conversions, what attribution model and measurement framework will you use to optimize across these channels?

Turn 13:
Excellent measurement strategy! Your multi-touch attribution model addresses the insurance buying journey much better than last-click. Let me structure your Step 8 measurement framework:

**ATTRIBUTION MODEL:**
- 40% last-click, 40% first-click, 20% assists
- 2-3 week conversion window to capture full buying cycle
- View-through conversion tracking for display/video

**CONVERSION FUNNEL TRACKING:**
1. Initial lead (all channels)
2. Qualified lead (primary KPI)  
3. Application started (video campaign focus)
4. Policy bound (ultimate success metric)

**CHANNEL-SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATION:**
- Search: Optimize for qualified leads at $30-32 CPL
- Data targeting: Optimize for qualified leads with 18% conversion rate
- Video: Optimize for application starts (higher-intent signal)
- Social: Optimize for qualified leads by segment

**MEASUREMENT INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED:**
- Multi-touch attribution platform
- Cross-device tracking for research-to-conversion path
- View-through conversion windows (1-day view, 7-day click minimum)

Should we also implement incrementality testing to validate your attribution model and measure true channel lift, especially for the upper-funnel video investments?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 14:
Perfect incrementality approach! Your testing strategy validates the higher-risk investments while leveraging proven channel data:

**INCREMENTALITY TESTING FRAMEWORK:**

**CTV Geo-Holdout Test:**
- Split core DMAs: Test markets with CTV vs control markets without
- Measure overall conversion lift across all channels in test markets
- 8-week minimum test period to capture buying cycle
- Budget: $150,000 CTV investment with clear lift measurement

**YouTube Audience-Based Test:**
- Create matched audience segments for pre-retirement education
- Expose treatment group to educational video content
- Hold back control group from YouTube targeting
- Measure application starts and policy conversions between groups
- Budget: $350,000 with control group validation

**Attribution Model Validation:**
- Use incrementality results to calibrate multi-touch attribution
- Adjust channel credit based on proven lift data
- Focus on video channel contribution to overall funnel

This gives you clean measurement for budget reallocation decisions while maintaining confidence in your search and data targeting performance.

Now for Step 9 - Testing. Beyond incrementality, what creative and targeting tests should we prioritize across your channel mix to optimize that $31 blended CPL target?
