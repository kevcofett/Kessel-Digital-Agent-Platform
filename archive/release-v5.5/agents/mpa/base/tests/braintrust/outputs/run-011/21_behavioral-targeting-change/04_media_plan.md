# Media Plan Output: Behavioral Targeting Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I am excited to build a media plan with you. We will cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start - you've given me strong foundational data. Let me calculate your efficiency target: $800,000 / 50,000 = $16 per subscriber. With $420 LTV, that's a 26:1 LTV:CAC ratio - very healthy for subscription business where 3:1+ is typically sustainable.

Your $16 acquisition cost is aggressive but achievable for fitness/nutrition verticals where performance campaigns often run $12-25 per subscriber depending on funnel optimization.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 50K new subscribers - is this about hitting a revenue milestone, market share target, or preparing for a specific business event?

Turn 3:
Smart thinking on the churn factor. Let me recalculate: If you need 50K quality subscribers after 15% early churn, you need 50,000 / 0.85 = 58,824 initial subscribers to account for that attrition.

$800,000 / 58,824 = $13.60 per initial subscriber. This is more aggressive but still within range for nutrition/fitness where optimized funnels can hit $10-18 per subscriber.

However, I want to flag a potential issue: if your $420 LTV assumes full retention but 15% churn in first 3 months, your effective LTV on that churned segment is much lower. Have you calculated what the blended LTV looks like when factoring in that early churn pattern?

This affects whether $13.60 acquisition cost maintains your unit economics for investor presentations.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Let me model the blended LTV to see if your economics work:

85% retain at $420 LTV = $357
15% churn early at $70 average = $10.50
Blended LTV = $357 + $10.50 = $367.50

At $13.60 acquisition cost, your LTV:CAC ratio is $367.50 / $13.60 = 27:1, which is still excellent for subscription business.

However, this assumes you can actually achieve $13.60 per subscriber. Fitness/nutrition benchmarks typically run $15-25 for quality subscribers, so you're at the aggressive end. Given your Series B timeline and the importance of hitting targets, I'd recommend modeling at $16-18 per subscriber to be more conservative.

At $17 per subscriber: $800,000 / $17 = 47,059 initial subscribers, netting you 40,000 quality subscribers after churn. Still strong progress toward your goal.

Does hitting 40K quality subscribers instead of 50K still support your $21M ARR milestone, or do we need to discuss increasing the budget to ensure you hit the full target?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Excellent - that clarifies the strategic importance. $21M ARR is a strong Series B milestone, and the timing around marathon training season shows good market awareness.

Let me verify your primary success metric: With 50,000 new subscribers as your volume target, is your primary KPI simply "new paid subscribers acquired" or do you have a specific quality threshold - like subscribers who remain active for 3+ months or hit a certain engagement level?

This matters because $16 per subscriber looks very different if we're measuring any subscription versus subscribers who stick around long enough to justify the $420 LTV assumption.

Turn 5:
Let me calculate what you'd need for 50K quality subscribers at $17 CPA:

50,000 quality subscribers / 0.85 retention = 58,824 initial subscribers needed
58,824 × $17 = $1,000,000 total budget required

So you'd need to increase from $800K to $1M - an additional $200K investment.

At that $1M budget level, you'd hit your $21M ARR milestone with strong unit economics: $367.50 LTV / $17 CAC = 21.6:1 ratio, which is still excellent for investor presentations.

The question becomes: is that additional $200K investment worth securing the Series B milestone versus the risk of falling short at $16.8M ARR?

Alternatively, we could explore if there are efficiency opportunities in your funnel - better landing pages, offer optimization, or audience precision - that might help you achieve closer to $15 CPA instead of $17. Even $15.50 CPA would let you hit 50K quality subscribers within your $800K budget.

What's your appetite for the budget increase versus betting on execution efficiency?

Turn 6:
Perfect - you've got the right mindset balancing the guaranteed path ($1M budget) with optimization upside.

For nutrition/subscription funnels, the biggest CPA improvements typically come from:

1. **Offer testing** - Free samples vs. discounted first month vs. money-back guarantees. Nutrition brands often see 20-40% CPA improvement with the right offer structure.

2. **Landing page personalization** - Different creative for marathon runners vs. cyclists vs. general fitness. Targeted messaging can improve conversion 15-25%.

3. **Checkout flow optimization** - Reducing form fields, adding trust signals, optimizing mobile experience often drives 10-20% improvement.

Now that we've locked in your economics ($1M budget targeting 58,824 initial subscribers at $17 CPA), let's move to Step 3: Audience definition.

You mentioned "fitness enthusiasts 25-55" initially. Given your tight efficiency targets and the need for precision, we should get much more specific. What behavioral signals beyond general fitness interest help you identify your highest-value subscribers - do they tend to be competitive athletes, specific sport participants, supplement buyers, or have other distinguishing characteristics?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 8:
Absolutely - that's smart prioritization. Triathletes and marathon runners as your core target, with sport-specific creative testing, gives us a focused but testable approach.

Let me size this refined audience: If serious endurance athletes are ~2-3M people nationally, and triathletes + marathon runners represent 60-70% of that group, we're looking at roughly 1.4-2M people as your primary target audience.

To acquire 58,824 subscribers from 1.4-2M people means achieving roughly 3-4% market penetration among this very specific group. That's ambitious but realistic given their existing supplement spend and your product-market fit.

The separate creative approach also supports your efficiency goals - personalized messaging typically improves conversion rates significantly.

Now for Step 4: Geography. Are you planning to target this audience nationally across all US markets, or do certain regions show stronger concentrations of serious triathletes and marathon runners? Markets like Boulder, Austin, San Francisco, and the Northeast corridor often have higher densities of competitive endurance athletes.

Turn 9:
Perfect strategic thinking - concentrating in high-density markets will definitely improve your efficiency toward that $17 CPA target.

Let me structure this geographically. Starting with top 10-15 DMAs makes sense, and I'd recommend this prioritization based on endurance athlete density:

**Tier 1 Priority DMAs (Launch First):**
- San Francisco Bay Area
- Boston 
- Denver/Boulder
- Austin
- Seattle
- Portland
- New York

**Tier 2 DMAs (Scale Phase):**
- Los Angeles
- San Diego
- Washington DC
- Philadelphia
- Chicago
- Minneapolis

This gives you roughly 40-50% of the serious triathlete/marathon runner population while maintaining geographic concentration.

Here's my key question for the DMA selection: Do you have any first-party data showing conversion rates or subscriber LTV by metro area? If certain markets like Boulder or Austin show meaningfully higher conversion rates or customer value, we should weight the budget allocation accordingly rather than just going by population density.

Also, should we plan to launch all Tier 1 markets simultaneously, or do you prefer a rolling launch to optimize as we go?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Excellent - that's exactly the precision we need. Serious endurance athletes with existing supplement spend and performance goals are much more valuable than general fitness enthusiasts.

Let me note a key insight: if your best customers are already spending $100+ monthly on nutrition, your $420 LTV might actually be conservative for this precise audience. Well-targeted serious athletes often have higher retention and spend.

Based on your description, we're looking at maybe 3-5% of the general fitness population. In a US market of roughly 60M fitness participants, serious endurance athletes training for events might be 2-3M people.

To hit 58,824 subscribers from this audience, you'd need roughly 2-3% market penetration among serious endurance athletes. That's aggressive but achievable with the right targeting.

Here's my key question: Within this serious endurance athlete group, do you see meaningful differences in value or conversion between marathon runners, triathletes, and cyclists? Should we prioritize one sport initially, or do they all convert and retain similarly enough to target as one broad "serious endurance" audience?

Turn 11:
Smart decision to focus the full $1M on acquisition - that clarity will help us optimize purely for subscriber volume at your target efficiency.

You're absolutely right about acquisition-retention coordination. Consistency between your acquisition promise and onboarding experience is crucial, especially for research-driven endurance athletes who will notice disconnects.

For example, if your acquisition creative emphasizes "science-backed formulas for race day performance," your onboarding should immediately deliver on that with performance guides, race nutrition timing, etc. Misaligned experiences hurt both conversion and early retention.

But let's save the detailed creative coordination for Step 10 when we discuss execution risks.

Moving to Step 6: Value Proposition. You mentioned testing offers earlier - moving from 20% first month discount to potentially free samples. Given your target audience of serious, research-driven athletes who care about taste and mixability, what's your hypothesis about which offer approach will drive better conversion while still attracting quality subscribers?

The offer structure directly impacts your ability to hit that $17 CPA target, so this decision is critical for your budget efficiency.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Excellent approach - starting with your highest-efficiency markets (Boulder, Austin, Seattle) will help you optimize toward that $15.50 CPA goal before scaling into the higher-volume, more competitive markets.

Let me model the rolling launch budget allocation:

**Phase 1 (Boulder, Austin, Seattle): ~$300K**
- Higher conversion rates support aggressive initial spend
- Optimize creative, offers, and targeting

**Phase 2 (Bay Area, Boston): ~$500K** 
- Scale with learnings from Phase 1
- Higher volume but more competitive

**Phase 3 (Portland + Tier 2 expansion): ~$200K**
- Final optimization and geographic expansion

This gives you budget flexibility to reallocate based on Phase 1 performance.

Now for Step 5: Budget structure. Beyond the geographic phasing we just outlined, how do you typically allocate between acquisition and retention marketing? With your Series B timeline, should we dedicate the full $1M to new subscriber acquisition, or do you need to reserve some budget for engaging and retaining those existing subscribers to support the ARR growth story?

Turn 12:
Your hypothesis is spot-on for this audience. Research-driven athletes absolutely want to test before committing, and you're right that $20-30 off isn't meaningful to people spending $100+ monthly on supplements.

The $4.99 shipping fee is smart - it filters out freebie seekers while keeping the barrier low. In nutrition/supplement space, paid sample programs typically see 15-25% conversion to full subscription among qualified audiences, versus 2-8% for pure freebies.

For serious endurance athletes specifically, conversion rates often run higher (20-30%) because they're actively seeking solutions, not just browsing. Your challenge will be sample-to-subscription attribution since there's typically a lag between sample request and subscription signup.

One consideration: samples change your funnel math. Instead of direct subscription conversion, you're optimizing for sample requests first. If samples cost $8-12 to fulfill plus your $4.99 shipping revenue, your effective "sample CPA" needs to be under $3-8 to maintain economics when 20-25% convert to $17 net CPA.

Should we model both offer structures - discount and samples - to see which path better supports your $17 CPA target, or are you confident enough in the sample hypothesis to build the plan around that approach?

Turn 13:
Smart thinking on the hybrid approach - given your Series B timeline, you're right not to bet everything on one offer structure.

Let me model your hybrid test economics:

**Sample path (70% = $700K):**
- Sample CPA target: $5-6 to maintain economics
- At 25% sample-to-subscription conversion
- Projects to ~28,000 initial subscribers

**Discount path (30% = $300K):**  
- Direct subscription CPA target: $17
- Projects to ~17,600 initial subscribers

Combined: ~45,600 initial subscribers = 38,760 quality subscribers after churn

This gets you close but falls short of your 50K target. To hit the full goal with this split, you'd need either better sample conversion rates or tighter sample CPAs.

"First month free" is interesting - it removes price friction like samples do but with simpler attribution. "30-day guarantee" reduces risk without changing the economics.

My recommendation: Test 70/30 split between samples and "first month free" rather than discount percentage. Both address the risk/trial concern your audience has, but with different attribution windows. Does that feel like a safer test structure for your timeline?

Turn 14:
You're absolutely right - we need to solve for that gap. The reallocation approach is smart given your timeline constraints.

Here's how I'd structure the adaptive testing:

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-3): $200K split test**
- $140K samples vs $60K first month free
- In Boulder/Austin markets only
- Fast learning on conversion rates and CPAs

**Phase 2 (Weeks 4-8): $400K heavy allocation**  
- 80-90% budget to winning offer structure
- Scale into Seattle + Bay Area
- Optimize toward winner's best CPA

**Phase 3 (Weeks 9-16): $400K full optimization**
- All budget to proven approach
- Full geographic rollout
- Push efficiency hard - target $15 CPA or $4 sample CPA

This gives you data-driven reallocation while maintaining timeline pressure.

The key question: If early data shows samples converting at 30%+ (better than modeled) or first month free hitting $15 CPA, you could reallocate aggressively and hit your 50K target.

Are you comfortable with this adaptive approach, or do you need more certainty upfront? We could also model a scenario where you secure additional budget if early performance exceeds targets.

Turn 15:
Excellent strategic thinking on both fronts. You're right to be concerned about the timeline - Q4 deadline means we can't afford slow learning.

For faster statistical significance, let's front-load Phase 1 to $300K over 2 weeks instead of $200K over 3 weeks. This gives you:
- $210K samples vs $90K first month free  
- 50% more volume for faster confidence intervals
- Decision point by week 2 instead of week 3

**Clear reallocation triggers:**
- If samples hit 28%+ conversion AND sample CPA ≤ $5: shift 90% to samples
- If direct hits $16 CPA or better: shift 90% to first month free
- If both underperform: emergency optimization sprint with creative/landing page tests

**Revised timeline:**
- **Phase 1:** Weeks 1-2, $300K front-loaded testing
- **Phase 2:** Weeks 3-8, $400K heavy allocation to winner  
- **Phase 3:** Weeks 9-15, $300K final optimization and scale

This gets you done by week 15, leaving buffer time before Q4 close.

The front-loading does mean higher risk if both offers underperform early, but given your Series B timeline, fast learning beats cautious pacing. Sound right?

Turn 16:
Excellent - you've got the right mindset for this timeline. The front-loaded approach with clear triggers gives you the best shot at hitting your 50K target.

Now for Step 7: Channels. With your $1M budget, precise audience targeting (serious triathletes/marathon runners), and geographic concentration in high-performing DMAs, we need channels that can reach research-driven endurance athletes efficiently.

Given your audience spends time in Strava, running forums, and triathlon communities, I'm thinking:
- Meta (Facebook/Instagram) for broad reach and lookalike targeting
- Google Search for high-intent capture  
- Potentially YouTube for longer-form educational content
- Native/content platforms where athletes research gear

Here's my key question: Do you have strong first-party data for lookalike modeling - existing subscriber emails, website visitors, or customer lists? Quality lookalikes could be crucial for hitting those aggressive efficiency targets, especially in the sample acquisition funnel where we need very precise targeting to keep sample CPA under $5.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 17:
Excellent first-party data assets - 25K subscriber lookalikes segmented by LTV will be powerful for both sample acquisition and direct subscription paths.

For native, I'm thinking both approaches: sponsored content in Runner's World/Triathlete Magazine for credibility, plus Outbrain/Taboola for broader reach. Your audience researches extensively, so educational content that doesn't feel like ads could work well.

Strava partnerships are intriguing - their audience alignment is perfect. If your small tests showed promise, it's worth exploring at scale. TrainingPeaks has similar potential but typically smaller reach.

Let me model a channel allocation for your $1M budget:

**Meta (40% = $400K):** Lookalike campaigns + interest targeting
**Google Search (30% = $300K):** High-intent keywords + brand protection  
**YouTube (20% = $200K):** Educational content + in-market audiences
**Native/Strava (10% = $100K):** Testing and audience expansion

Does this allocation feel right for your goals? Should we weight Meta higher given your strong lookalike data, or do you think Google Search deserves more given the research-driven purchase behavior?

Turn 18:
Absolutely - the 35/35/20/10 split makes perfect sense. Research-driven athletes definitely warrant equal weighting between Meta's lookalike precision and Google's high-intent capture.

Let me calculate the revised allocation:
- **Meta: 35% = $350K** (lookalike campaigns + interest targeting)
- **Google Search: 35% = $350K** (high-intent keywords + brand protection)
- **YouTube: 20% = $200K** (educational content + in-market audiences)  
- **Native/Strava: 10% = $100K** (testing and expansion)

This gives you $350K each for your two strongest channels, with room to reallocate if Strava testing shows it deserves more budget.

For Step 8: Measurement. Given your adaptive testing approach with clear reallocation triggers, we need measurement that supports fast decision-making. 

With your sample vs. direct subscription test, attribution timing becomes critical. Sample requests might convert to subscriptions 1-4 weeks later, while direct subscriptions convert immediately.

What attribution window are you currently using for subscription conversions, and do you have the tracking infrastructure to connect sample requests to eventual subscriptions for accurate sample-to-subscription rate calculation?

────────────────────────────────────────
