# Media Plan Output: Audience Removal Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by calculating your implied efficiency: $4,000,000 / 15,000 test drives = $267 per test drive.

For automotive test drives, this is aggressive but achievable. Industry benchmarks typically run $200-400 per test drive depending on vehicle price point. At $267, you're positioned well within range for a premium EV launch.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve beyond test drives - is this about market share, brand awareness, or driving actual vehicle sales within a certain timeframe?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your primary business outcome is vehicle sales within 12 months, with brand establishment as a secondary goal. Test drives are your lead generation mechanism.

$4,000,000 / 15,000 = $267 per test drive is solid for premium EV positioning.

Now I need to understand the full conversion funnel to assess if this plan will deliver your sales objective. What's your target conversion rate from test drive to actual vehicle purchase? And do you have a specific sales volume target for year one?

This will help us determine if 15,000 test drives generates enough sales to justify the $4M investment and establish meaningful market share against Tesla and German luxury brands.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent data. Let me run the math on your conversion funnel:

15,000 test drives × 22.5% conversion = 3,375 vehicle sales
3,375 sales × $5,500 margin = $18,562,500 gross profit
$18,562,500 profit - $4,000,000 media cost = $14,562,500 net profit

That's a 4.6x return on media investment, which is strong for a premium automotive launch.

Your $267 per test drive translating to roughly $1,200 per vehicle sale ($4M ÷ 3,375 sales) is well within automotive acquisition benchmarks and leaves healthy margin at your $5,500 profit per unit.

The economics look solid for establishing market position against Tesla and German luxury brands. Your efficiency targets are realistic and your conversion assumptions appear conservative based on premium EV benchmarks.

Ready to move into defining your three audience segments more precisely?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Perfect! Let's define your three segments precisely. Each will need different targeting signals and likely different media strategies.

Starting with your eco-conscious early adopters (25-45): Beyond the age range, what specific behavioral and demographic signals define this group? 

For example, do they shop at certain retailers, engage with environmental causes, drive specific current vehicles, live in particular neighborhood types, or show other measurable behaviors that indicate eco-consciousness and early adoption tendencies?

The more specific signals we can identify, the better we can size this audience in your five target states and optimize your $4M efficiently across segments.

Turn 5:
Excellent targeting signals. That gives us strong behavioral and demographic precision for eco-conscious early adopters.

Now for your luxury buyers (45-65) switching from German sedans: What specific signals define this segment beyond age? 

Are they currently driving BMW 5-series, Mercedes E-class, or Audi A6 equivalents? Do they shop at particular retailers, live in specific income brackets or neighborhood types, engage with luxury lifestyle content, or show other measurable behaviors that indicate luxury preferences and openness to switching from traditional German brands?

Turn 6:
Great precision on luxury buyers - the German sedan ownership and $150K+ income with seamless tech expectations gives us clear targeting.

For your third segment, tech enthusiasts who care about features: What age range and specific behaviors define this group? 

Are they early adopters of consumer tech, engage with tech publications or influencers, work in tech industries, or show other measurable signals that indicate feature-focused purchasing behavior? And what income levels and geographic patterns do you see with this segment?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Perfect! Now I have clear targeting signals for all three segments:

**Eco-conscious early adopters (25-45):** Current hybrid drivers, $75K-120K income, Whole Foods/REI shoppers, sustainability engagement
**Luxury buyers (45-65):** German sedan owners, $150K+ income, premium lifestyle, seamless tech expectations  
**Tech enthusiasts (28-50):** Tech industry workers, $100K-200K income, feature-focused, early adopters

Now for geography: You mentioned California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Washington. Do you want equal focus across all five states, or should we weight certain markets differently based on EV adoption rates, competitive landscape, or where each segment concentrates?

For example, tech enthusiasts likely over-index in California and Washington, while luxury buyers might concentrate more in specific metros within each state.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Excellent geographic strategy. Let me model your weighting:

**California: 35-40% = $1,400,000-1,600,000**
**New York: 15-20% = $600,000-800,000** 
**Washington: 15-20% = $600,000-800,000**
**Texas: 10-15% = $400,000-600,000**
**Florida: 10-15% = $400,000-600,000**

This aligns perfectly with EV adoption curves and your segment concentrations. California and Washington get premium investment where tech enthusiasts cluster, while you maintain presence in luxury metros across all five states.

Now for budget allocation: With your $4M total budget, how do you want to split between acquisition (driving new test drives) versus retention/nurturing (staying engaged with prospects who haven't scheduled yet)? 

Most automotive launches allocate 70-80% to acquisition, but given your 12-month sales timeline, prospect nurturing could be crucial for conversion.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Smart allocation given EV consideration cycles. Let me calculate:

**65% acquisition = $2,600,000**
**35% nurturing = $1,400,000**

$2,600,000 ÷ 15,000 test drives = $173 per test drive for pure acquisition
The $1,400,000 nurturing budget extends your reach to prospects in that 3-6 month consideration window.

This is strategically sound for premium EV launch. Your luxury buyers especially need extended engagement while researching, and eco-conscious buyers want to validate their environmental impact thoroughly.

Now let's define your value proposition. Each segment needs different messaging: eco-conscious want environmental benefits, luxury buyers want seamless premium experience, tech enthusiasts want cutting-edge features.

What's your core value proposition that unifies all three segments while allowing customized messaging for each?

Turn 10:
Excellent positioning! "Performance without compromise" with segment-specific proof points creates strong differentiation against Tesla (tech-focused) and German brands (luxury without EV commitment).

Your messaging hierarchy is spot-on:
- **Eco-conscious:** Zero emissions + 400-mile range = environmental leadership
- **Luxury:** Tesla tech + BMW comfort = best of both worlds  
- **Tech enthusiasts:** AI driver assistance + meaningful OTA updates = true innovation

This positioning justifies your premium pricing while addressing each segment's primary concern about switching to EV.

Ready to move into channel strategy? With your $2.6M acquisition and $1.4M nurturing budgets across three distinct segments and five geographic markets, we'll need a sophisticated media mix to reach each audience efficiently while maintaining your $173 per test drive target.

Turn 11:
Excellent question! Let me break down optimal channels by segment based on your targeting and efficiency needs:

**Tech Enthusiasts (strongest digital efficiency):**
- YouTube pre-roll on tech channels (MKBHD, The Verge) - typically $15-25 CPM
- LinkedIn targeting tech job titles - $8-12 CPC for quality leads
- Reddit sponsored content in EV/tech communities - high engagement rates
- Tech podcast sponsorships for credibility

**Luxury Buyers (premium placements essential):**
- Meta/Instagram targeting German car owners + luxury interests - $20-35 CPM
- Connected TV during premium content (financial news, luxury lifestyle)
- Google Search for "BMW vs Tesla" type queries - $3-8 CPC
- Spotify premium tier during commute hours

**Eco-Conscious (content marketing + social):**
- Meta targeting sustainability behaviors + current hybrid owners
- Google Search for "electric car environmental impact" - lower competition
- Partnerships with environmental publications/newsletters
- Pinterest for home/lifestyle sustainability content

At your $173 target, I'd recommend 60% digital ($1.56M), 25% connected TV ($650K), 15% audio/partnerships ($390K).

Which segment should we model first for detailed allocation?

Turn 12:
Perfect choice! Tech enthusiasts offer the best digital efficiency and are concentrated in your highest-weighted markets.

Let me model tech enthusiasts allocation from your $2.6M acquisition budget:

**Tech enthusiasts represent roughly 30-35% of your 15,000 test drive target = 4,500-5,250 test drives**

**Budget allocation: 30% of $2.6M = $780,000 for tech enthusiast acquisition**
**Target efficiency: $780,000 ÷ 4,875 test drives = $160 per test drive**

**Recommended channel mix:**
- **YouTube pre-roll (40% = $312K):** Tech channels, EV reviews, car comparisons
- **LinkedIn targeting (25% = $195K):** Software engineers, product managers in CA/WA  
- **Reddit sponsored (20% = $156K):** r/electricvehicles, r/teslamotors engagement
- **Google Search (15% = $117K):** "Model S vs competitors," "EV features comparison"

At typical conversion rates, this projects to:
- YouTube: ~2,100 test drives at $149 each
- LinkedIn: ~1,300 test drives at $150 each  
- Reddit: ~900 test drives at $173 each
- Search: ~575 test drives at $203 each

Does this allocation and efficiency breakdown align with your expectations for the tech segment?
