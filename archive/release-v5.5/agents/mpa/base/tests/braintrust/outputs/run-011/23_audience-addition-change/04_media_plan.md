# Media Plan Output: Audience Addition Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

I can see you're targeting qualified leads for wealth management. Let me clarify your primary business outcome: Are you aiming to generate 5,000 leads that convert to consultations, or 5,000 leads that become paying clients? The distinction affects how we model your economics.

$2M budget / 5,000 targets = $400 per lead, which looks very strong for wealth management if these convert well to your $15K LTV clients.

Turn 2:
Perfect! So your objective is 5,000 qualified leads converting to consultations, with your sales team handling the 10-15% conversion to clients.

Let me model the economics: $2M budget / 5,000 leads = $400 per qualified lead. At 12.5% average conversion, that's 625 new clients. With $15K LTV per client, your projected revenue is 625 × $15K = $9.375M against $2M spend - a strong 4.7x return.

Your $400 cost per qualified lead is actually conservative for wealth management. Based on financial services benchmarks, qualified leads for HNW prospects typically run $300-800, so you're well-positioned.

Now for economics validation: What's your typical profit margin on that $15K client LTV? This helps us confirm whether $400 per lead (or roughly $3,200 per acquired client) maintains healthy unit economics.

Turn 3:
Got it. I'll model using 65% margin based on your estimate - that's typical for wealth management where the main costs are advisor time and overhead.

At 65% margin: $15K LTV × 65% = $9,750 profit per client
Your acquisition cost: $2M / 625 clients = $3,200 per client
Profit margin after acquisition: $9,750 - $3,200 = $6,550 per client

That's a healthy 3:1 profit-to-acquisition ratio, well above the 2:1 minimum for sustainable growth. You can refine the margin anytime.

Your economics are solid: $400 per qualified lead is achievable for HNW targeting, and the unit economics support profitable growth at scale.

Ready to move to Step 3 - Audience? I want to dig deeper into your HNW 55+ targeting to ensure we can efficiently reach this precise segment within your top 30 wealth markets.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 4:
Perfect! Your HNW 55+ segment with $1M+ investable assets represents roughly 2-3% of the US population, but concentrates heavily in your top 30 wealth markets - that geographic focus is smart for efficiency.

Let me dig deeper into the behavioral and psychographic signals that will help us reach this audience efficiently:

Beyond age and wealth, what specific life stage indicators or financial behaviors best identify your ideal prospects? For example, are they typically recent retirees, people selling businesses, those receiving inheritances, or facing specific financial transitions like pension rollovers?

This behavioral layer is crucial because "wealthy 55+" is demographic - but the right life stage signals help platforms find people actively seeking wealth management advice right now.

Turn 6:
Perfect! You've identified the key behavioral signals: active financial education consumption combined with complexity overwhelm. That's a powerful targeting combination.

Based on your insights, your targetable audience includes:
- Demographics: 55+ with $1M+ assets in top 30 wealth markets
- Life stage: Recent retirees, business sale prospects, inheritance recipients  
- Behavioral: Consuming WSJ/Barron's, using retirement calculators, researching rollover options
- Intent: Searching tax strategies, estate planning, succession planning

This creates a highly qualified but narrow audience. In your top 30 markets, this likely represents 200K-400K targetable individuals across platforms.

One critical consideration: Are you open to expanding beyond the 55+ age threshold? High-earning professionals in their late 40s often start serious retirement planning and may have $1M+ assets earlier. This could significantly expand your addressable audience while maintaining quality.

What's your thinking on age flexibility versus maintaining strict 55+ targeting?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Excellent! Those transition moments create urgency that drives higher conversion rates. Pension rollovers are particularly valuable because they combine immediate need with substantial assets.

Let me build on those behavioral signals. For efficient targeting, we need to layer in contextual and interest signals platforms can actually target:

What content, publications, or online behaviors do these prospects typically engage with? For example, do they research retirement planning tools, read financial publications like Barron's or WSJ, visit 401k provider websites, or engage with content about tax planning or estate planning?

These digital breadcrumbs help platforms identify people in those transition moments before they start actively shopping for advisors.

Turn 7:
Expanding to 45+ with the same asset and behavioral criteria roughly doubles your targetable audience while potentially increasing quality. Here's the math:

Ages 55+: ~200K-400K individuals in top 30 markets
Ages 45+: ~400K-800K individuals in same markets

The 45-54 segment often has higher conversion potential because:
- Peak earning years create urgency around tax optimization
- Early retirement planning requires more sophisticated strategies  
- Longer relationship runway increases your LTV significantly

At $400 per qualified lead, the expanded audience gives you much more efficient reach while platforms can still apply the same behavioral filters: financial content consumption, retirement calculator usage, tax strategy research.

Your 45+ prospects would likely include executives hitting stock option vesting, professionals maximizing 401k contributions, and business owners doing succession planning - all high-intent, high-value scenarios.

Ready to move to Step 4 - Geography? I want to map your top 30 wealth markets and size the target audience in each to optimize your $2M budget allocation across markets.

Turn 8:
Perfect! Geographic allocation is crucial for efficiency with HNW targeting. Let me map your top 30 wealth markets with target audience sizing and build the foundation for smart budget allocation.

First, I need to understand your current market definition. When you say "top 30 wealth markets," are you referring to:

1. Specific DMAs (like New York, San Francisco, Boston)
2. Metropolitan areas (which might span multiple DMAs)  
3. A predetermined list you already use
4. Markets ranked by HNW population concentration

Also, do you have any current geographic performance data - markets where you've seen stronger lead quality or conversion rates? This helps me prioritize the highest-opportunity DMAs for your audience targeting.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 9:
Excellent geographic intelligence! Your performance patterns make perfect sense - Northeast corridor familiarity with fee-based services, tech markets with stock option transitions, and Florida retirement destinations create natural demand.

Let me model your market tiers for budget allocation:

**Tier 1 (High Performance):** NY, Boston, DC, SF, Seattle, Naples, Palm Beach
**Tier 2 (Test Markets):** Chicago, LA, plus other tech-adjacent or retirement markets  
**Tier 3 (Lower Priority):** Remaining Midwest and underperforming West Coast

At $400 per lead targeting, your 45+ HNW audience breaks down roughly:
- Tier 1 markets: ~60% of target audience, should get 65-70% of budget
- Tier 2 markets: ~30% of audience, 25-30% of budget
- Tier 3 markets: ~10% of audience, 5-10% of budget

This suggests roughly $1.3-1.4M for Tier 1, $500-600K for Tier 2, $100-200K for Tier 3.

Does this geographic prioritization align with your strategic thinking, or do you want to weight any specific markets differently based on business priorities?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Great strategic thinking! Chicago absolutely deserves tier upgrade given your regional presence - local credibility is huge in wealth management. Let me adjust:

**Revised Tier 1:** NY, Boston, DC, SF, Seattle, Chicago, Naples, Palm Beach
**Budget reallocation:** ~$1.5M to Tier 1 (including Chicago boost), $400K Tier 2, $100K Tier 3

Your seasonal insight is spot-on. Florida markets show distinct patterns:
- Q4: Tax planning urgency drives activity
- Q1: Snowbird season + fresh retirement planning  
- Q2-Q3: Slower period, lower efficiency

Budget pacing suggestion:
- Florida markets: 40% in Q4/Q1, 60% in Q2/Q3
- Tech markets: Steady pacing, slight Q1 bump for stock option vesting
- Northeast: Consistent year-round

$2M / 5,000 leads across optimized geography = $400 per lead maintained, but efficiency gains from market prioritization should improve conversion rates.

Ready for Step 5 - Budget? I want to break down that $2M into acquisition vs. retention components and map the monthly pacing across your seasonal insights.

Turn 11:
Smart question! For lead generation campaigns, I typically recommend keeping acquisition and retention budgets separate to maintain clear performance tracking. Your $2M should stay focused on the 5,000 new qualified leads.

However, let's break down your $2M acquisition budget strategically:

**Primary Allocation:**
- Prospecting (cold audience): 70% = $1.4M for 3,500 leads  
- Retargeting (warm prospects): 30% = $600K for 1,500 leads

$1.4M / 3,500 = $400 per cold lead
$600K / 1,500 = $400 per warm lead (but these convert 2-3x better)

**Geographic Distribution within $2M:**
- Tier 1 markets: $1.5M = 3,750 leads
- Tier 2 markets: $400K = 1,000 leads  
- Tier 3 markets: $100K = 250 leads

**Monthly Pacing (considering seasonality):**
- Q1: $600K (Florida boost, stock option season)
- Q2: $450K (steady state)
- Q3: $450K (steady state)  
- Q4: $500K (tax planning urgency)

Does this allocation framework align with your acquisition priorities, or should we adjust the prospecting versus retargeting split?

Turn 13:
Perfect! Your differentiation challenge is real - you can't out-resource Fidelity, but you can out-personalize them. The big players are platforms; you're advisors.

Here's your value proposition framework targeting those transition moments:

**Core Message:** "Navigate your biggest financial decisions with advisors who know you personally"

**Differentiation Pillars:**
1. **Personal Relationship vs. Call Center:** "Your dedicated advisor, not a 1-800 number"
2. **Transition Expertise vs. General Platform:** "Specialists in retirement transitions and wealth preservation" 
3. **Proactive Guidance vs. DIY Tools:** "We call you with opportunities, you don't search for answers"

**Transition-Specific Messaging:**
- Pension rollovers: "Turn your 401k into a personalized retirement income plan"
- Business sales: "Preserve and grow your life's work beyond the sale"
- Inheritance: "Honor your legacy with expert wealth stewardship"

The key is emotional resonance: Fidelity offers tools, you offer peace of mind during life's biggest financial moments.

What specific client outcomes or success stories best illustrate this personal touch advantage? Real examples make the differentiation tangible and credible.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 12:
Excellent question! For wealth management, "warm prospects" should be highly qualified behavioral segments, not just website visitors. Here's how to maximize that $600K retargeting budget:

**Tier 1 Warm Audiences (Highest Intent - 60% of retargeting budget = $360K):**
- Downloaded retirement guides/calculators
- Spent 3+ minutes on advisor bio pages  
- Visited fee structure or services pages multiple times
- Engaged with retirement planning content

**Tier 2 Warm Audiences (Medium Intent - 30% of retargeting budget = $180K):**
- 60+ second website visitors from financial content
- Email subscribers who haven't converted
- Social media engagers on financial education posts

**Tier 3 Warm Audiences (Broad Reach - 10% of retargeting budget = $60K):**
- All website visitors from past 90 days
- Video viewers (75%+ completion rates)

The key is behavior-based qualification. Someone who downloads your "401k Rollover Guide" is exponentially more valuable than a casual homepage visitor.

Ready for Step 6 - Value Proposition? I want to ensure your messaging framework differentiates you from the Fidelitys and Schwabs while addressing those transition moment pain points we identified.
