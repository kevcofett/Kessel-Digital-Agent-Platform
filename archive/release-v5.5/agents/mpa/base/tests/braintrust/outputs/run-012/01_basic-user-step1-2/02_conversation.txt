USER:
Hi! I'm looking to get more people to buy shoes from our online store. Can you help me figure out the best way to do that?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What business outcome are you trying to achieve? For example, are you looking to get a specific number of new customers, hit a revenue target, or grow your overall sales by a certain amount?

USER:
We're looking to grow our overall sales - I'd say we want to increase our revenue significantly this year. I don't have a specific number in mind yet, but we want to reach more customers and get them buying our shoes online. Maybe we could aim for like a 30-40% increase in sales?

AGENT:
That's a great goal! A 30-40% sales increase is solid growth. To build the right plan, I need to understand what that means in actual numbers.

What's your current annual revenue? This will help me calculate what a 30-40% increase looks like in dollars, so we can figure out how many new customers you'll need and what it might cost to get them.

USER:
We did about $800,000 in revenue last year, so I guess that means we'd want to hit somewhere around $1 million to $1.1 million this year. That sounds like a lot when I say it out loud, but our shoes are really good quality and I think there's definitely demand out there for what we're selling.

AGENT:
Perfect! So you're targeting $200,000 to $300,000 in additional revenue - that's $1 million to $1.1 million total. That's ambitious but absolutely achievable with the right approach.

To figure out how many new customers you need, what's your average order value? In other words, how much does a typical customer spend when they buy shoes from you?
