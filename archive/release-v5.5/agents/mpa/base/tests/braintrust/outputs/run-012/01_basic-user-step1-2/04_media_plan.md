# Media Plan Output: Basic User - Steps 1-2 Completion

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What business outcome are you trying to achieve? For example, are you looking to get a specific number of new customers, hit a revenue target, or grow your overall sales by a certain amount?

Turn 2:
That's a great goal! A 30-40% sales increase is solid growth. To build the right plan, I need to understand what that means in actual numbers.

What's your current annual revenue? This will help me calculate what a 30-40% increase looks like in dollars, so we can figure out how many new customers you'll need and what it might cost to get them.

Turn 3:
Perfect! So you're targeting $200,000 to $300,000 in additional revenue - that's $1 million to $1.1 million total. That's ambitious but absolutely achievable with the right approach.

To figure out how many new customers you need, what's your average order value? In other words, how much does a typical customer spend when they buy shoes from you?
