USER:
Hey, I'm the growth lead at QuickSend. We're a remittance fintech looking to acquire 10,000 new users this quarter with a $500K media spend. Let's build out the media strategy.

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with some quick math on your targets: $500K / 10,000 users = $50 per user acquisition. For fintech remittance, this is achievable - typical CAC runs $40-80 based on market benchmarks.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve beyond user acquisition? For example, are you focused on transaction volume, revenue growth, or market share in specific corridors?

TURN 2 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
That $50 CAC sounds reasonable based on what I've seen in the market. Our primary focus is definitely on transaction volume growth - we want users who will actually send money, not just sign up and sit dormant. Revenue growth is the ultimate goal, but we're measuring success by how much volume flows through our platform since that directly correlates with our take rate revenue.

AGENT:
Perfect. So transaction volume growth is your primary objective, with revenue as the ultimate goal. That's smart - dormant users don't drive business value.

Let me update our projections: At $50 CAC for 10,000 active users, assuming a typical 2-3% take rate for remittance, each user needs to generate $1,667-$2,500 in transaction volume to break even on acquisition costs alone. 

For your primary KPI measuring success, what specific volume target are you aiming for? Are you thinking total transaction volume across all 10,000 users, or average volume per user, or perhaps volume within the first 90 days after acquisition?

TURN 3 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I honestly haven't nailed down the specific volume targets yet - that's something we're still working through internally. But your math on the break-even volume makes sense given our take rate structure. I'm thinking we should probably focus on volume within the first 90 days since that's typically when we see users establish their sending patterns. What does the data suggest for typical transaction volumes in the remittance vertical for new user cohorts?

AGENT:
Got it. I'll model using typical remittance benchmarks while you refine internally. Based on industry data, new remittance users typically generate $800-1,200 in transaction volume within their first 90 days, with high-intent users reaching $1,500-2,000. You can adjust these targets anytime.

This creates an interesting efficiency challenge: your $50 CAC requires users to transact $1,667-2,500 to break even, but typical new users only generate $800-1,200 in 90 days. This means you'll need to target high-intent users or optimize for users likely to exceed average volumes.

Moving on - what's your target customer count for this quarter? You mentioned 10,000 users, but I want to confirm if that's your firm target or if there's flexibility based on efficiency.

USER:
That efficiency gap is definitely something we need to address - targeting high-intent users makes a lot of sense given those numbers. The 10,000 user target has some flexibility, but it's pretty close to what leadership is expecting this quarter. I'd say we could go as low as 8,000 if the quality is significantly better, or push to 12,000 if we're seeing really efficient acquisition. What strategies typically work best for identifying and targeting those high-intent remittance users?

AGENT:
Excellent - that 8,000-12,000 range gives us good flexibility to optimize for quality over pure volume.

Let me update our efficiency scenarios:
- 8,000 users: $500K / 8,000 = $62.50 CAC (more selective, higher intent)
- 10,000 users: $500K / 10,000 = $50 CAC (baseline target)  
- 12,000 users: $500K / 12,000 = $41.67 CAC (aggressive efficiency)

The $62.50 CAC for higher-intent users actually aligns better with your break-even math if those users generate $1,800+ in 90-day volume.

For high-intent targeting strategies - we'll dive deep into audience signals in Step 3, but the key is layering behavioral and demographic indicators that predict regular sending patterns.

Before we move to audience strategy, I need to understand your unit economics better. What's your actual take rate percentage, and do you have any data on customer lifetime value beyond the first 90 days?

TURN 5 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our take rate is around 2.5%, which is pretty standard for the industry. As for customer lifetime value beyond 90 days, I honestly don't have great visibility into those metrics - our analytics team is still building out the longer-term cohort tracking. Can you model based on industry benchmarks for now? I know that's not ideal, but we're working on getting better data infrastructure in place for LTV analysis.

AGENT:
Perfect, 2.5% take rate is solid. I'll model using industry benchmarks for LTV - remittance users typically generate 60-80% of their lifetime value in the first year, with active users averaging $3,000-5,000 annual volume. I'll use conservative estimates and you can refine when your cohort data comes online.

Let me recalculate with 2.5% take rate:
- Break-even volume: $50 CAC / 2.5% = $2,000 per user
- Your target range: $1,667-2,500 (my earlier calc was close)
- Industry 90-day average: $800-1,200
- High-intent 90-day target: $1,500-2,000

This confirms you need above-average users. At $2,000 volume per user with 2.5% take rate, each user generates $50 revenue - perfectly matching your $50 CAC for immediate payback.

Step 1 complete - we have clear objectives and realistic efficiency targets. Ready to move to audience strategy to identify those high-intent users?
