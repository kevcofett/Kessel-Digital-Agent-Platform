# Media Plan Output: Brand Building with Limited Data

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You mentioned building brand awareness in the West Coast market with a $500K budget. To start with outcomes - what specific business result are you trying to achieve? For example, are you looking to drive a certain number of new customers, generate leads, or hit a revenue target in these new markets?

Turn 2:
Got it - brand awareness to drive customer acquisition in new markets. For Step 1, I need to help you set a measurable target so we can build an effective plan.

Since you want to generate revenue and acquire customers, let's focus there. With your $500K budget, you could realistically target anywhere from 2,500 to 8,300 new customers depending on efficiency. Here's the math:

At $60 per customer (conservative): $500K ÷ $60 = 8,300 customers
At $200 per customer (if brand building is expensive): $500K ÷ $200 = 2,500 customers

For natural supplements entering new markets, $80-150 per customer is typical based on the need for education and trust-building.

What feels like a realistic customer acquisition target for your first year in these West Coast markets?

Turn 3:
Perfect! Let's model 4,500 customers as your target. At $500K budget: $500,000 ÷ 4,500 = $111 per customer. That sits right in your comfort zone and is realistic for natural supplements with brand-building needs.

Now for Step 2 - Economics. To assess if $111 per customer is achievable, I need to understand your unit economics. What's the average order value for your supplements, and do you have a sense of your profit margin per sale?

This will help us determine if you can afford that $111 acquisition cost while staying profitable.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using reasonable assumptions based on your input, and you can refine anytime.

With $77.50 average order value and 65% gross margin, your gross profit per sale is about $50. For natural supplements, typical fulfillment and overhead costs run 15-25% of revenue, so let's estimate $15 in additional costs. That gives you roughly $35 contribution margin per customer.

Here's what this means: At $111 acquisition cost with $35 contribution margin, you'd need customers to purchase 3.2 times ($111 ÷ $35) to break even. For natural supplements, repeat purchase rates of 40-60% within 12 months are typical, with 2-4 purchases per repeat customer.

This suggests your $111 target is achievable but requires strong retention. You'll likely break even around month 8-12 per customer.

Does this timeline and repeat purchase expectation align with what you've seen in your existing markets?

Turn 5:
Excellent! Your 50% repeat rate with 2-3 additional purchases validates the model. At 50% retention × 2.5 average repeat purchases = 1.25 additional orders per customer. Combined with the initial purchase, that's 2.25 total orders generating about $174 lifetime revenue and $113 lifetime contribution margin. This covers your $111 acquisition cost with a small positive return.

Economics look solid for Step 2. Moving to Step 3 - Audience.

Since you're targeting health-conscious people on the West Coast, I need to understand your ideal customer better. What specific characteristics define your best customers? For example, are they primarily focused on specific health concerns, certain age ranges, income levels, or lifestyle factors like fitness enthusiasts or organic food buyers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 6:
Perfect profile - active millennials and Gen Z who prioritize natural wellness and research purchases. This gives us strong targeting signals.

For the West Coast markets, this audience likely ranges from 2-4 million people across California, Oregon, and Washington. The good news is this audience size supports your 4,500 customer target without oversaturation.

Key targeting signals I'm noting:
- Age 25-40 (millennials/Gen Z)
- Active lifestyle (gym, yoga, hiking)
- Organic/natural product purchasers
- Health optimization mindset
- Research-oriented buyers

One critical question: Since these are research-oriented customers who don't know your brand yet, how will you establish credibility and trust? Do you have customer testimonials, third-party certifications, ingredient transparency, or founder story that resonates with this audience's values?

This will significantly impact your messaging strategy and conversion rates.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 7:
Excellent trust-building assets! Third-party testing, organic certifications, ingredient transparency, and a founder story rooted in personal health challenges - those are exactly what research-oriented wellness customers look for.

Step 3 complete. Moving to Step 4 - Geography.

You mentioned California, Oregon, and Washington. For your $500K budget and 4,500 customer target, I need to understand your geographic priorities within these states. 

Are you planning to focus on major metro areas like Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and Portland? Or do you want broader coverage across these entire states? The West Coast has some very expensive media markets, so geographic focus will impact your efficiency significantly.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Smart approach! Focusing on LA, SF, Seattle, and Portland concentrates your budget where your audience density is highest.

Let me model the geographic allocation. These four metros contain roughly:
- LA: ~13 million people (40% of your target region)
- SF Bay Area: ~7.7 million (25%)
- Seattle: ~4 million (20%) 
- Portland: ~2.6 million (15%)

Based on audience concentration and market size, I'd suggest:
- LA: $200K (40% of budget)
- SF: $125K (25%)
- Seattle: $100K (20%)
- Portland: $75K (15%)

This allocates roughly $50-75 per thousand people in each market, accounting for the higher media costs in LA and SF.

Does this geographic split align with your market entry priorities, or would you weight any of these metros differently?

Turn 9:
Perfect! Let's adjust slightly for Seattle's strong wellness culture. How about:
- LA: $190K (38%)
- SF: $125K (25%)  
- Seattle: $110K (22%)
- Portland: $75K (15%)

This gives Seattle an extra $10K to capitalize on that wellness-focused market while keeping LA as the primary focus.

Step 4 complete. Moving to Step 5 - Budget allocation within your $500K.

You've allocated geographically, but now we need to split between brand awareness (upper funnel) and direct response (lower funnel). Since you're new to these markets, you'll need both: awareness to introduce your brand and performance marketing to convert ready buyers.

For natural supplements in new markets, what feels right - a 60/40 split favoring brand building, or closer to 50/50, or something else?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Excellent thinking! 60/40 brand-to-performance is smart for market entry. Let me break down your $500K:

**Brand Awareness (60%): $300K**
- Builds recognition and trust with new audiences
- Educates about your brand story and quality standards
- Creates top-of-mind awareness for future purchases

**Direct Response (40%): $200K** 
- Captures immediate demand from ready buyers
- Targets people actively searching for supplements
- Generates early revenue and customer data

At $111 per customer target, your $200K performance budget projects to ~1,800 customers. The remaining 2,700 customers will come from brand awareness converting over time - which is realistic given the trust-building needed in supplements.

Step 5 complete. Moving to Step 6 - Value Proposition.

Given your audience of research-oriented wellness enthusiasts, what's your core message? Is it the founder's health journey, the third-party testing and purity, the natural effectiveness, or something else that should lead your positioning?
