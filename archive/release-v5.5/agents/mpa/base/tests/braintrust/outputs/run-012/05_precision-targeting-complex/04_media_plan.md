# Media Plan Output: Precision Targeting with Complex Attributes

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a precision media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me immediately model your economics: $1.5M ÷ 2,500 leads = $600 per qualified lead. For HNW wealth management, this is conservative - industry benchmarks typically run $800-1,500 per qualified lead given the audience exclusivity and long sales cycles.

Your target efficiency looks very achievable. What specific business outcome are you trying to drive with these 2,500 qualified leads?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect! Let me update our projections with your conversion data:

2,500 leads × 10% conversion (midpoint) = 250 new clients
250 clients × $2.5M AUM (midpoint) = $625M total AUM

That exceeds your $50M+ target by 12x, which suggests either very conservative targeting or significant upside potential.

Your primary KPI is net new AUM acquisition, measured as $50M+ target. But let me flag a precision issue: with your conversion rates, you're projecting $625M in new AUM. 

Is the $50M target a minimum threshold, or should we model around the $625M projection? This affects how we think about lead quality versus volume trade-offs.

Turn 3:
Excellent - $625M AUM potential with $312M as a strong success point gives us clear targets.

Your economics look very strong: at $600 per lead generating $2.5M average AUM, you're achieving roughly 4,000x return on ad spend. Even with conservative 6% conversion rates, you'd hit $375M AUM.

Now let's validate feasibility. HNW lead generation typically requires $800-1,500 per qualified lead due to audience scarcity and platform limitations. Your $600 target is aggressive but achievable with your 50K client database for lookalike modeling - that first-party data provides significant efficiency advantage.

With your targeting precision requirements and 10 premium DMAs, what's your definition of a "qualified lead" for handoff to sales?

Turn 4:
Perfect qualification framework. Your asset verification requirement is crucial - unverified leads waste expensive sales time in this vertical.

Let me model the implications: requiring $1M+ verified assets in 10 premium DMAs significantly constrains your addressable audience. Typical HNW targeting reaches 2-4% of adults in these markets, so roughly 400K-800K targetable individuals across your DMAs.

At 2,500 leads from ~600K addressable audience, you're targeting 0.4% conversion - that's achievable but requires precision execution.

Your 50K client database becomes critical here. Lookalike audiences from verified HNW clients typically outperform cold prospecting by 60-80% in this vertical.

How do you currently verify the $1M+ asset threshold - through progressive profiling, third-party data partnerships, or qualification calls?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Smart verification stack. That friction balance is the core optimization challenge for HNW campaigns.

Your progressive profiling approach is essential - immediate asset verification kills 70-80% of qualified prospects. The Wealth-X/RelSci partnerships provide the verification layer without front-end friction.

Let me model this: if cold prospects convert at 2-3% to qualified leads, but your 50K client lookalikes convert at 4-6%, that's where your $600 CPL becomes achievable. The data partnerships justify the cost by preventing $500/hour advisor waste.

Your economics look solid. Step 2 complete.

Moving to audience definition: beyond the $1M+ assets and 45-65 age range, what behavioral signals best predict someone entering your qualification funnel? Specific content topics, life events, or business transitions that indicate active wealth management needs?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent behavioral intelligence. Those liquidity event signals are gold for HNW targeting.

Your 3x conversion lift on tax-specific content (loss harvesting, 1031 exchanges, CRTs) versus general retirement content shows clear intent hierarchy. The 6-18 month research window is critical timing - too early and they're not ready, too late and they've chosen advisors.

Let me note the audience precision required: you're targeting the intersection of $1M+ assets, specific life events, active research behavior, and geographic concentration. This creates a highly qualified but narrow audience - exactly right for your quality-over-volume approach.

Key audience segments emerging:
- Business owners in succession planning phase
- Executives with deferred comp/option events  
- High-value real estate transaction participants
- Inheritance/estate planning researchers

Which of these segments converts best to actual AUM in your experience?

Turn 7:
Brilliant insight on segment performance differences. Let me model this:

Business owners: Lower conversion (~8%) but $5-10M AUM = highest total value
Executives with deferred comp: 15-18% conversion at $2-3M AUM = most predictable pipeline
Real estate: Variable quality but immediate liquidity needs
Inheritance: Longest cycle but highest LTV

This suggests a tiered approach: executives for reliable volume, business owners for AUM upside, with different nurture strategies by segment.

Your audience definition is comprehensive. Moving to geography - you mentioned 10 DMAs by HNW concentration. Given these behavioral segments, do you see meaningful performance differences across your target markets? For example, do succession planning prospects perform better in certain cities versus deferred comp executives?

Turn 8:
Perfect geographic intelligence. Your segment-to-DMA mapping makes complete sense:

SF/Seattle: Tech deferred comp goldmine
NYC/Chicago: Succession planning hubs  
Miami/Dallas: Tax-advantaged wealth migration
Boston: Strong across segments (diversified economy)
LA: Real estate driven but unpredictable entertainment wealth

Your 40% allocation to SF/NYC/Seattle aligns with highest volume and AUM potential.

Let me model budget implications: 40% = $600K across three premium markets. At $600 CPL, that's 1,000 leads from your highest-value DMAs. The remaining $900K across seven markets targets 1,500 leads.

Geography is clear. Now for budget validation: your $1.5M total budget breaks down how across acquisition versus retention/nurture? And do you have flexibility to reallocate between DMAs based on early performance signals?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Perfect - pure acquisition budget with reallocation flexibility gives us optimal performance potential.

Your monthly reallocation approach is smart for HNW campaigns where small audience shifts can dramatically impact lead quality. Moving budget toward verified prospects rather than maintaining rigid splits will maximize your $625M AUM potential.

Budget allocation confirmed: $1.5M acquisition focused, geographically flexible based on performance.

Now for value proposition: given your segment insights (succession planning, deferred comp, real estate events, inheritance), what core value proposition resonates most strongly with prospects in that critical 6-18 month research window? Tax optimization, wealth preservation, or growth strategy?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Excellent value proposition clarity. Tax optimization as your lead hook makes perfect sense - it's immediate, quantifiable, and addresses the urgent pain point during liquidity events.

"Keeping more of what you've earned" resonates because prospects can calculate tangible savings. The layered approach (tax optimization primary, wealth preservation for inheritance segment) shows sophisticated messaging strategy.

Your value proposition is strong and segment-aligned. Moving to channels - with your precision targeting requirements, verified asset thresholds, and 10 premium DMAs, which channels are you currently using or considering? Given your 50K client database and behavioral targeting needs, I'm thinking lookalike audiences will be critical, but what's your current channel mix thinking?
