# Media Plan Output: Full 10-Step Media Planning

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business outcome. You mentioned acquiring 15,000 new customers - is customer acquisition your primary objective, or are you also focused on revenue growth, brand awareness, or retention alongside acquisition?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Customer acquisition as your primary objective makes sense for a growing company. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success.

Let me run the basic math on your targets: $750,000 budget ÷ 15,000 customers = $50 per customer acquisition cost. For home decor, this is quite efficient - typical CAC runs $60-100 in this vertical, so you're targeting the aggressive end.

What's your primary success metric - is it simply the count of 15,000 new customers, or do you have a specific revenue target from those acquisitions that defines success?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent! 15,000 new customers as your primary KPI is clear and measurable. Your $2-3M first-year revenue projection suggests strong unit economics - that's roughly $133-200 revenue per customer against your $50 acquisition cost.

Now let's validate if your $50 CAC target is achievable. With your $750K budget targeting 15,000 customers, this requires excellent efficiency. In home decor, achieving $50 CAC typically demands:
- Tight audience targeting to high-intent customers
- Strong creative that drives immediate action
- Optimized landing pages and conversion funnels

Do you have existing customer data we can use for lookalike targeting, or will this be primarily prospecting to cold audiences?

Turn 4:
Perfect! Having 8,000-10,000 existing customers is a huge advantage for hitting your $50 CAC target. Lookalike audiences from your best customers typically perform 40-60% better than cold prospecting.

Your honesty about conversion optimization is smart - basic landing pages can easily cost you 20-30% efficiency. The good news is that's controllable and fixable.

Let me assess the overall feasibility: $50 CAC is aggressive but achievable with your strong first-party data foundation and conversion improvements. You'll need disciplined audience targeting and testing, but this isn't unrealistic for home decor with good creative and optimized funnels.

Economics look solid - we have your objective (15,000 customers), KPI (customer count), target volume (15,000), and efficiency target ($50 CAC). 

Now let's move to audience definition. Who is your ideal customer? Can you describe your best existing customers by demographics, behaviors, or characteristics?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Excellent audience definition! Homeowners 30-55, $75K+ income, predominantly women, suburban, actively decorating - that's a well-defined target with clear behavioral signals.

Let me size this audience. Your demographic filters (homeowners, 30-55, $75K+ HHI, suburban) typically capture about 12-15% of the total US adult population. With behavioral signals like "actively decorating" and social media engagement with home content, we're looking at roughly 8-12% of adults, or approximately 20-30 million people nationally.

That's a healthy audience size for your 15,000 customer target - you'd need to convert about 0.05-0.075% of the total addressable audience, which is very achievable.

Are there any specific life events or triggers that drive your best customers to purchase? Things like moving, renovating, seasonal decorating, or major life changes?

Turn 6:
Perfect! Those life event triggers - moving, seasonal refreshes, holiday hosting, post-renovation - are goldmine targeting signals that can significantly improve your $50 CAC efficiency.

These behavioral triggers typically increase conversion rates by 2-3x compared to general "interested in home decor" targeting. Moving-related audiences and seasonal decorating intent are especially strong for furniture and decor.

Your audience definition is solid: homeowners 30-55, $75K+ HHI, suburban women, actively decorating, triggered by life events. This gives us multiple targeting angles to test and optimize.

Now let's define your geography. Are you targeting the entire United States, or do you have specific regions, states, or markets you want to focus on? Any areas where shipping costs or delivery logistics make certain markets more or less attractive?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Smart observation about metro suburban markets! Those areas - Atlanta, Dallas, Phoenix, Denver suburbs - align perfectly with your customer profile: homeowners with space to decorate and income to spend.

Focusing on major metro suburban areas could improve your $50 CAC target significantly. These markets typically have:
- 20-30% lower shipping costs for furniture
- Higher homeownership rates (65-75% vs 50-60% rural)
- Better income concentration in your $75K+ target
- More efficient media buying with concentrated audiences

I'd recommend prioritizing the top 25-30 DMAs (Designated Market Areas) initially. This captures roughly 70% of your target demographic while keeping shipping costs manageable and media buying efficient.

Your geographic strategy shapes budget allocation - metro-focused campaigns typically need 15-20% less budget for the same customer volume due to efficiency gains.

Now let's move to budget structure. You have $750K total. How are you thinking about allocating this - do you want to split it evenly across the year, or do you have seasonal considerations given those spring/fall decorating peaks you mentioned?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Excellent seasonal thinking! Weighting 35-40% toward spring/fall decorating peaks is smart - those periods typically deliver 40-50% better conversion rates in home decor.

Let me model your seasonal allocation:
- Spring peak (Mar-May): ~20% = $150K
- Fall peak (Sep-Nov): ~20% = $150K  
- Holiday period (Nov-Dec): ~15% = $112K
- Remaining months: ~45% = $338K

This gives you $450K during high-intent periods and $300K for baseline always-on acquisition. At your $50 CAC target:
- Peak periods: 9,000 customers from $450K
- Off-peak periods: 6,000 customers from $300K
- Total: 15,000 customers

The seasonal weighting should actually help you hit that aggressive $50 CAC since you're spending more when intent is highest.

Now let's define your value proposition. What makes HomeStyle Decor different from competitors like Wayfair, Overstock, or local furniture stores? What's your unique selling point that converts browsers into buyers?

Turn 9:
That's a compelling value proposition! "Curated collections that take the guesswork out of decorating" directly addresses a major pain point - choice paralysis in home decor.

Your positioning between mass market and high-end is smart: better than Target, more accessible than West Elm. That maps perfectly to your $75K+ income target who want quality but are price-conscious.

The "complete looks you can shop" angle is especially powerful for your moving and renovation triggers - people in those situations often need multiple coordinated pieces, not just one item.

This value prop should work well in your messaging: lead with the curation benefit (saves time, removes guesswork), then reinforce the quality-value positioning. Your seasonal campaigns can emphasize "refresh your space with coordinated looks" while always-on can focus on "simplified decorating."

Now for channels. With your $50 CAC target, existing customer data for lookalikes, and curated visual products, I'd recommend starting with Meta and Google as your foundation. Does that align with your thinking, or do you have experience with other channels you'd want to include?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Excellent instincts! Pinterest is actually perfect for home decor - it's where your target audience actively seeks decorating inspiration. Pinterest users are 2-3x more likely to make home purchases compared to other social platforms.

Let me recommend a strategic channel mix for your $750K:

**Core Foundation (70% = $525K):**
- Meta (Facebook/Instagram): 40% = $300K
- Google (Search + Shopping): 30% = $225K

**Growth Channels (25% = $187K):**
- Pinterest: 15% = $112K  
- Influencer partnerships: 10% = $75K

**Testing Budget (5% = $38K):**
- YouTube, programmatic display, or emerging platforms

This allocation leverages your visual products and existing organic momentum. Pinterest and influencer work synergistically - influencers create content that performs well on Pinterest.

At your $50 CAC target, this projects to:
- Meta: 6,000 customers
- Google: 4,500 customers  
- Pinterest: 2,250 customers
- Influencer: 1,500 customers
- Testing: 750 customers

Does this channel mix align with your comfort level and team capabilities?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 11:
That's a crucial reality check! Two people managing four active channels plus influencer partnerships while hitting aggressive efficiency targets is a recipe for burnout and underperformance.

Let me suggest a phased approach that respects your bandwidth:

**Phase 1 (Q1-Q2): Focus & Foundation**
- Meta: 50% = $375K
- Google: 40% = $300K  
- Testing budget: 10% = $75K
- Target: 7,500 customers in 6 months

**Phase 2 (Q3-Q4): Strategic Expansion**
- Add Pinterest: 15% of remaining budget
- Scale influencer partnerships: 10%
- Adjust Meta/Google based on Phase 1 learnings

This lets you perfect your core channels first, then expand when you have systems and possibly additional team members. Many companies try to do too much too fast and end up with mediocre performance across all channels.

Alternative: Consider agency support for 1-2 channels (like Pinterest launch or influencer management) while you focus on Meta and Google optimization.

What feels more realistic for your team - the phased approach or getting external help for specific channels?

Turn 12:
Perfect! That phased approach with selective agency support is exactly right. You'll get much better results focusing your internal energy on optimizing Meta and Google while having experts launch Pinterest properly.

For measurement, let's establish your key metrics. Since your primary KPI is 15,000 new customers, I recommend tracking:

**Primary:** Customer acquisition count and CAC by channel
**Secondary:** Click-to-customer conversion rates, audience quality scores
**Health metrics:** Attribution windows (7-day click, 1-day view), incrementality checks

Given platform attribution inflation, I'd suggest setting up first-party tracking through your CRM to validate platform-reported numbers. Also recommend monthly incrementality tests - especially important with your aggressive $50 CAC target.

For testing, what's your comfort level with budget allocation for experiments? I typically recommend 10-15% of channel budgets for creative testing, audience experiments, and landing page optimization. With your conversion funnel improvements needed, testing budget will be crucial for hitting efficiency targets.

How much experimentation budget feels right for your goals?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 10: Risks

Turn 13:
Excellent! $67-100K for testing in Phase 1 is smart allocation. Landing page optimization alone could deliver 20-30% conversion improvements, which directly helps your $50 CAC target.

First-party tracking setup complexity depends on your current tech stack. If you have Google Analytics 4 and a decent CRM, it's typically a 2-4 week implementation with some technical help. You'll need:

- UTM parameter consistency across all channels
- CRM integration to track customer lifecycle 
- Conversion API setup for platforms (Meta, Google)
- Attribution modeling that matches your business logic

Most companies use a combination of platform pixels for optimization plus server-side tracking for validation. The investment pays off quickly - platform inflation can make your CAC appear 15-25% better than reality.

Finally, let's address risks. Your biggest risks are:
1. **Efficiency risk:** $50 CAC is aggressive - if you hit $65-70, you'll acquire 11-12K customers instead of 15K
2. **Execution risk:** Limited team bandwidth during scale-up
3. **Attribution risk:** Platform measurement inflation masking true performance

What's your biggest concern, and do you have contingency plans if efficiency runs 20-30% higher than target?

Turn 14:
Smart contingency thinking! Flexible budget reallocation and accelerated optimization testing are exactly the right levers. Having that first-party tracking validation will be critical for making those mid-flight decisions with confidence.

Your plan is solid:
✓ **Outcomes:** 15,000 new customers (primary KPI)
✓ **Economics:** $50 CAC target, $750K budget, strong seasonal weighting
✓ **Audience:** Homeowners 30-55, $75K+, suburban women, life event triggers
✓ **Geography:** Top 25-30 metro DMAs for efficiency
✓ **Budget:** Phased approach, 35-40% in peak seasons
✓ **Value Prop:** Curated collections that simplify decorating
✓ **Channels:** Meta/Google foundation, Pinterest/influencer growth
✓ **Measurement:** First-party tracking with platform validation
✓ **Testing:** 10-15% budget for optimization, focus on landing pages
✓ **Risks:** Efficiency contingencies and execution bandwidth management

You've built a realistic, well-sequenced plan that respects your team's capabilities while targeting aggressive but achievable growth. The phased approach gives you room to learn and adjust. Ready to execute this plan, or any final questions on implementation?

Turn 15:
Perfect timing question! For spring decorating season success, I'd recommend this launch timeline:

**January Launch (8 weeks out):**
- Start Meta and Google optimization immediately
- Begin landing page A/B tests 
- Implement first-party tracking validation
- Build lookalike audiences from your existing customer data

**February Scale:**
- Increase spend as you validate what's working
- Refine audience targeting based on early performance
- Optimize for March-May peak season readiness

This gives you 6-8 weeks to optimize before spring peak, which is crucial for hitting your aggressive $50 CAC target during high-intent periods.

For Pinterest agencies, look for partners with specific home/lifestyle vertical experience and strong creative capabilities. The platform is very visual and requires different content strategies than Meta/Google. I'd recommend interviewing 2-3 agencies in Q2 so you can launch Pinterest properly for fall decorating season.

You're well-positioned for success - the foundation is solid, timeline is realistic, and you've built in the right flexibility. Your 15,000 customer target is ambitious but achievable with this structured approach!
