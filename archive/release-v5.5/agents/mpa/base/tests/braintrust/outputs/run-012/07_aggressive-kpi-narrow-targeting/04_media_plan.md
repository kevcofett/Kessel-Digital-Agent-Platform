# Media Plan Output: Aggressive KPI - Must Narrow to Achieve

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by reforecasting your targets: $750K / 5,000 = $150 per customer. With $2,400 LTV, that's a 16:1 LTV:CAC ratio - excellent unit economics. Based on B2B SaaS benchmarks, $150 CAC for mid-market logistics is achievable but requires tight execution. Typical range is $120-$200 for this segment.

You've clearly defined your business outcome (5,000 new customers) and efficiency target ($150 CAC). To complete Step 1, I need to understand how you'll measure success beyond customer count. 

What's your primary KPI - is it new customer acquisitions, or are you tracking something like qualified pipeline, trials-to-paid conversion, or revenue impact?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Your objective is clear: acquire 5,000 net new customers who stick past month one, with customer count as your north star KPI. That's a solid foundation.

Now let's validate if your $150 CAC target is realistic. You mentioned $2,400 LTV - what's the timeline on that LTV calculation? Is that over 12 months, 24 months, or customer lifetime? 

This matters because if efficiency runs 10-20% worse than your $150 target, I want to ensure the unit economics still work for your business model.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it - 12-month LTV of $2,400 gives you reasonable cushion. At $170 CAC, you're still at 14:1 LTV:CAC which is strong for B2B SaaS. Your $180 ceiling maintains 13:1 - still workable but tight.

Let me recalculate your efficiency range:
- Target: $750K / 5,000 = $150 CAC
- Acceptable: $170 CAC = $850K total spend for 5,000 customers  
- Ceiling: $180 CAC = $900K total spend for 5,000 customers

This means you have $100K-$150K buffer above your $750K budget if needed. Based on logistics SaaS benchmarks, $150-$170 CAC is achievable for your segment, though it requires precise audience targeting and channel efficiency.

Your economics foundation is solid. Ready to move to audience definition where we'll build the targeting precision needed to hit these numbers?

Turn 4:
Excellent - staying within $750K shows strong budget discipline. For $150-$170 CAC in logistics SaaS, targeting precision is critical.

Your base criteria (SMB logistics managers, 50-500 employees, $5M-$50M revenue) is a solid start. Let me estimate the addressable market: roughly 180K-220K companies fit that revenue/size profile in North America. If each has 1-2 logistics decision makers, we're looking at 200K-400K total addressable audience.

That's actually a good size for your budget - large enough to avoid quick saturation but focused enough for efficiency.

Now, within that universe, what pain points or behavioral signals identify companies most likely to convert? You mentioned "stuck on spreadsheets or legacy TMS systems" - how do we identify those companies digitally? Are there specific inefficiency indicators, growth patterns, or technology gaps that signal readiness to switch?

Turn 5:
Perfect - those are strong behavioral signals that we can target digitally. Let me map this out:

**High-Intent Signals:**
- Active job postings for logistics/ops roles (indicates pain)
- Search behavior around "TMS software," "shipping optimization" 
- LinkedIn engagement with logistics content

**Growth Indicators:**
- 20%+ YoY revenue growth (hitting manual process breaking point)
- Recently outgrown founder-led logistics management

This gives us multiple targeting layers: intent-based (job postings, search), content engagement (LinkedIn logistics content), and growth stage (rapid expansion companies).

Estimated audience sizes:
- Job posting targeting: ~50K-80K companies
- Search intent audiences: ~30K-50K monthly
- High-growth SMBs: ~40K-60K companies
- LinkedIn logistics engagement: ~25K-40K decision makers

With some overlap, total addressable is likely 120K-180K prospects - tight enough for efficiency, large enough for scale.

What geographic markets are you prioritizing? Are you going broad across North America, or focusing on specific regions where logistics challenges are most acute?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 7:
Perfect - $750K fully dedicated to acquisition gives us clear focus. No budget dilution across objectives means we can optimize every dollar for that $150 CAC target.

Let me reforecast with geographic allocation:
- Tier 1 markets (75%): $562K targeting 3,750 customers at $150 CAC
- Tier 2 expansion (25%): $188K targeting 1,250 customers at $150 CAC
- Total: $750K / 5,000 customers = $150 CAC blended

This allocation should work well since Tier 1 markets can support your target CAC while Tier 2 provides scale without requiring efficiency sacrifice.

For value proposition, what's your primary competitive advantage that resonates most with SMBs stuck on spreadsheets? Is it ease of implementation, cost savings, time savings, or something else that makes SwiftDeliver the obvious choice when they hit that manual process breaking point?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Smart geographic focus - Tier 1 metros have higher logistics complexity and budget tolerance, which should support your $150-$170 CAC targets.

Let me map the concentration:
- Top 10 metros likely contain 60-70% of your total addressable SMBs
- Tier 1 markets: NYC, LA, Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta, Seattle, Boston, SF Bay Area
- These metros have 2-3x higher logistics software adoption rates
- CAC tolerance typically 20-30% higher than national average

Budget allocation framework:
- 70-80% ($525K-$600K) to Tier 1 metros = 3,500-4,000 customers
- 20-30% ($150K-$225K) to Tier 2 expansion = 1,000-1,500 customers

This geographic concentration should improve efficiency through:
- Higher audience density for targeting
- Better content relevance (metro-specific logistics challenges)
- Stronger word-of-mouth in concentrated business networks

Now let's nail down your budget allocation. You have $750K total - how are you thinking about splitting between customer acquisition and other objectives like brand awareness or retention marketing?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Excellent - "automate the chaos without the complexity" is a powerful value proposition that directly addresses their pain. The 2-week vs 3-6 month implementation contrast is a major differentiator.

Your messaging hierarchy is spot-on:
1. **Speed to value**: Up and running in 2 weeks (vs months)
2. **Life impact**: 4-5 hours daily admin → 30 minutes  
3. **Operational relief**: "Get your life back" from spreadsheet chaos
4. **Business outcome**: Cost savings follow naturally

This value prop should perform well across channels - the time savings is quantifiable for performance ads, while "get your life back" has emotional resonance for video/display content.

Now let's build your channel strategy. With $750K for pure acquisition targeting logistics managers in Tier 1 markets, we need channels that can reach your high-intent audiences efficiently. 

Based on your behavioral signals (job postings, search intent, LinkedIn engagement), what channels are you currently using or considering? And are there any channels leadership has ruled out?

Turn 9:
Smart foundation - LinkedIn and Google Search are perfect for your high-intent targeting and attribution requirements. Let me model your current mix and expansion opportunities.

**Core channels performing well:**
- LinkedIn: Direct manager targeting + logistics content engagement
- Google Search: High-intent "TMS software" queries  
- G2/Capterra: SMB software research behavior

**Expansion opportunities with clean attribution:**
- Google Display (remarketing): Re-engage search visitors
- YouTube: Logistics managers consume "how-to" content
- Industry publications (digital): Logistics Management, Supply Chain Dive
- LinkedIn Newsletter sponsorships: Reach logistics communities

For $750K allocation, I'd recommend:
- 40% Google (Search + Display): $300K
- 35% LinkedIn (Ads + Sponsored content): $262K  
- 15% Review sites (G2/Capterra): $113K
- 10% Industry digital: $75K

This keeps 90% in proven attribution-friendly channels while testing 10% in targeted industry reach.

What's your current CAC performance on LinkedIn and Google Search? This will help calibrate if we need the mix to skew more toward your best-performing channel.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Excellent point - let me reforecast based on your actual performance data:

**Current Performance:**
- Google Search: $125-$140 CAC (16% better than target)
- LinkedIn: $160-$180 CAC (7-20% above target)  
- G2/Capterra: Good conversion, limited volume

**Revised allocation leveraging performance:**
- 45% Google (Search + Display): $337K → 2,400-2,700 customers
- 30% LinkedIn: $225K → 1,250-1,400 customers  
- 15% Review sites: $113K → 750 customers
- 10% Industry digital: $75K → 500 customers

This projects to 4,900-5,350 customers - right in your target range.

The key question: Can Google Search absorb that extra $37K while maintaining $125-$140 CAC? Search volume constraints might push efficiency down as you scale. 

What's your current monthly Google Search spend, and have you seen CAC inflation as you've increased investment? If search can handle the volume, this reallocation makes perfect sense.

Turn 11:
Perfect approach - start with 45% Google allocation and monitor for CAC inflation. Your scaling data shows typical efficiency degradation ($115→$125-$140 as spend doubled), so we should expect similar patterns.

**Recommended strategy:**
- Start: 45% Google ($28K monthly) and track CAC weekly
- Trigger: If Google CAC hits $150+, reallocate $50K-$75K to LinkedIn
- Backup: Industry digital and display ready for quick activation

**Monthly monitoring framework:**
- Weeks 1-4: Baseline performance at new spend levels
- Month 2: Assess if $150 CAC threshold triggered
- Month 3: Optimize allocation based on efficiency curves

This gives you flexibility to optimize in real-time while protecting your $150 target.

For measurement, you mentioned leadership wants clear ROAS tracking. Beyond CAC, what attribution model are you using? First-touch, last-touch, or multi-touch? And how are you handling the longer B2B sales cycles where prospects might research for weeks before converting?
