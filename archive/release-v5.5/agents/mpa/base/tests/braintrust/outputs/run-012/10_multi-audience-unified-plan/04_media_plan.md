# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience Unified Media Plan

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've provided excellent segment detail that we'll use in Step 3. First, let's establish your core business outcome. Beyond the 25,000 enrollees, what's the primary business result you're trying to achieve - is this about market share growth, revenue targets, or competing in specific segments?

Turn 2:
Perfect. Market share growth through competitive positioning is clear. Now for measurement - what's your primary KPI to track success? Is it the 25,000 total enrollees, enrollees per segment, or something like enrollment rate or cost per enrollment?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using $2,500 average LTV based on your range. That gives you a 21:1 LTV to CAC ratio at $120 per enrollment - very healthy for insurance.

Let me update projections by segment with your targets:

**Young Professionals:** 8,000 enrollees at $150 implied CAC = $1.2M needed
**Families:** 12,000 enrollees at $100 implied CAC = $1.2M needed  
**Pre-Medicare:** 5,000 enrollees at $120 implied CAC = $600K needed

Total: $3M matches your budget perfectly.

However, young professionals at $150 is aggressive given you mentioned digital competition driving costs to $150-250. If that segment runs to $200, you'd need $1.6M, creating a $400K gap.

Your economics look achievable overall, but we'll need tight audience definition for young professionals to hit efficiency targets. Ready to dive into detailed audience segmentation for each group?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent. 8,000 young professionals, 12,000 families, and 5,000 pre-Medicare totaling 25,000 enrollees. Let me work out what your $3M budget implies:

$3,000,000 ÷ 25,000 enrollees = $120 per enrollment

That's your blended target efficiency. Since you mentioned unit economics aren't solid yet, I'll model using health insurance benchmarks. Typical customer acquisition costs for health insurance range $80-200 per enrollment depending on segment complexity and competition.

Your $120 target sits in the middle range - achievable but will require disciplined targeting. Young professionals typically cost more ($150-250) due to digital competition, while families and pre-Medicare can be more efficient ($80-150) through targeted channels.

Do you have any sense of what an enrolled customer is worth to TrueHealth over their lifetime?

Turn 5:
Perfect approach - precision for young professionals, broader reach for the other segments. Let's build detailed audience profiles starting with your most challenging segment.

For **Young Professionals (ages 26-35, urban metros)**, you mentioned health-conscious gym members who prefer digital interactions. To hit that $150 CAC target against heavy competition, we need to get very specific.

Beyond gym membership, what other behavioral or life-stage signals identify your highest-converting young professionals? For example: recent job changes, recent moves, existing health concerns, income thresholds, or specific employer types?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Excellent - life transitions and immediate need states. That's much more precise than broad millennial targeting.

**Young Professionals Refined Profile:**
- Ages 26-35, $50K-$100K income
- Recent movers to NYC/SF/LA/Chicago metros
- Freelancers/gig workers or employees at companies <500 people
- Active on wellness apps, engage with fitness/health content
- In coverage transition moments

Let's size this audience. In your four target metros (NYC, SF, LA, Chicago), we're looking at roughly 400K people in this age/income range. After filtering for recent moves, employment type, and wellness engagement, we're probably targeting 40K-60K highly qualified prospects.

At 40K target audience with 8,000 enrollment goal, that's a 20% conversion rate requirement - aggressive but achievable with precise messaging to people in active need states.

Now for **Families (ages 35-50, suburban markets)** - you mentioned comprehensive coverage and cost predictability matter most. What family characteristics best predict enrollment beyond having kids under 18?

Turn 7:
Perfect targeting signals - families with active healthcare needs and employment gaps.

**Families Refined Profile:**
- Ages 35-50, $75K-$150K household income
- Kids under 18 with ongoing health needs (regular pediatric care, orthodontics, sports)
- Self-employed spouse OR limited employer benefits
- Suburban markets around top 50 metros

This is a much larger addressable audience - roughly 2-3 million households in suburban rings around top metros. After filtering for income, health engagement, and employment situations, we're targeting approximately 400K-600K qualified family households.

At 500K target audience with 12,000 enrollment goal, that's a 2.4% conversion rate - very realistic for families actively managing health needs.

Finally, **Pre-Medicare (ages 55-64)** - you mentioned stability and network quality matter most. What specific situations drive this segment to switch insurance providers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Excellent - job transitions, network disruptions, and geographic moves are strong conversion triggers.

**Pre-Medicare Refined Profile:**
- Ages 55-64, variable income but value-focused
- Job transitions (early retirement, layoffs, employer coverage gaps)
- Network disruptions (doctor/specialist changes)
- Geographic relocations, especially to FL/AZ/TX
- Managing ongoing health conditions requiring specialist care

Heavy concentration in FL/AZ/TX plus national coverage for job transitions gives us roughly 8-10 million people in this age range. After filtering for transition moments and health engagement, we're targeting approximately 800K-1.2M qualified prospects.

At 1M target audience with 5,000 enrollment goal, that's a 0.5% conversion rate - very achievable for people actively seeking coverage.

**Summary Check:**
- Young Professionals: 50K audience, 8,000 target (20% rate)
- Families: 500K audience, 12,000 target (2.4% rate) 
- Pre-Medicare: 1M audience, 5,000 target (0.5% rate)

Ready to move to geography and determine how to allocate your $3M budget across these markets?

Turn 9:
Smart competitive positioning approach. Let me model geographic allocation based on opportunity concentration and competitive dynamics.

**Geographic Budget Allocation:**

**Young Professionals ($1.2M):**
- NYC Metro: $400K (strongest volume but highest competition)
- LA Metro: $300K (good tech/gig economy)
- Chicago Metro: $300K (lower costs, good conversion)
- SF Metro: $200K (highest competition, most expensive)

**Families ($1.2M):**
- Top 10 suburban markets: $800K (60% concentration)
- Next 15 suburban markets: $300K (geographic expansion)
- Flexibility reserve: $100K (performance reallocation)

**Pre-Medicare ($600K):**
- Florida: $250K (highest relocating retiree concentration)
- Texas: $200K (strong growth market)
- Arizona: $150K (concentrated opportunity)

This puts 70% of budget in your strongest competitive positions while maintaining presence in key growth markets. The suburban family allocation gives you the most flexibility to optimize toward performance.

Does this geographic weighting align with where you see your best competitive advantages?

Turn 10:
Perfect - Dallas, Atlanta, and Phoenix suburban rings are definitely in that top 10 allocation. Those markets have strong family demographics and less digital competition pressure.

Before we move to channels, let's establish your value proposition framework for each segment. The right messaging will be crucial for hitting those efficiency targets, especially the aggressive young professional numbers.

Based on your audience insights, what's your core value proposition for **Young Professionals** dealing with coverage transitions? Is it convenience and speed of enrollment, cost transparency, digital-first experience, or something else that differentiates you from those tech-focused competitors?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 12:
Perfect - addressing the real family pain point of access barriers when kids need care.

**Family Value Prop: "Complete Family Care Without the Runaround"**
- Broad pediatric specialist networks (ortho, sports medicine)
- Straightforward coverage for ongoing needs
- Predictable family pricing for budget planning
- No referral hassles when kids need care

Finally, for **Pre-Medicare** dealing with transitions and network continuity concerns - what's your core differentiator? Is it network stability during their bridge to Medicare, specialized transition support, or coverage designed for their specific health management needs?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Excellent positioning - "reliable when you need us" versus "coolest brand." That's a smart differentiation against digital-first competitors who over-promise and under-deliver on service.

**Young Professional Value Prop: "Seamless Coverage Transitions"**
- Immediate coverage start (no gaps)
- Metro network continuity (keep your doctors)
- Transparent upfront pricing (no surprises)

Now for **Families** - you mentioned they care about comprehensive coverage and cost predictability. Given their focus on kids' ongoing health needs and orthodontics, what's your strongest differentiator? Is it pediatric network quality, family plan pricing, or coverage for specific family health scenarios?

Turn 13:
Excellent - stability during a vulnerable transition period.

**Pre-Medicare Value Prop: "Seamless Bridge to Medicare"**
- Broad specialist networks in key markets (FL/AZ/TX)
- Dedicated transition support (employer to individual to Medicare)
- Continuity of established care relationships
- Designed for temporary but critical coverage needs

**Value Proposition Summary:**
- Young Professionals: "Seamless Coverage Transitions" (reliability over flash)
- Families: "Complete Family Care Without the Runaround" (access over barriers)
- Pre-Medicare: "Seamless Bridge to Medicare" (stability over disruption)

All three emphasize your operational strength against competitors who may have better marketing but weaker service delivery.

Now let's build your channel strategy. With $3M across three distinct segments requiring different messaging, which channels do you currently use, and where do you see the biggest opportunities to reach these audiences efficiently?

Turn 14:
Smart channel-to-segment thinking. Let me model your $3M allocation across channels optimized for each audience:

**Young Professionals ($1.2M) - Digital Transition Focus:**
- Paid Search: $600K (50% - high-intent transition terms)
- Paid Social: $400K (33% - life event targeting)
- Display Retargeting: $200K (17% - nurture consideration)

**Families ($1.2M) - Suburban + Digital Mix:**
- Local Digital: $400K (33% - school district/suburban geo-targeting)
- Connected TV: $360K (30% - family programming)
- Paid Social: $240K (20% - parenting/health content)
- Paid Search: $200K (17% - family plan research)

**Pre-Medicare ($600K) - Traditional + Digital Hybrid:**
- Direct Mail: $240K (40% - relocation/transition targeting)
- Paid Social: $180K (30% - Facebook transition moments)
- Local Media: $120K (20% - FL/AZ/TX markets)
- Paid Search: $60K (10% - Medicare bridge terms)

This puts 70% of budget in digital channels but matches traditional channels to segments most likely to respond. Does this channel weighting align with where you see each segment's media consumption?

Turn 15:
Great question on local media formats. For FL/AZ/TX pre-Medicare targeting, I'd recommend a mixed approach within that $120K:

**Local Media Breakdown ($120K):**
- Local Digital News: $60K (50% - retirement/health content adjacency)
- Local Radio: $36K (30% - AM/talk radio during commute/morning)
- Local TV: $24K (20% - morning news/health segments)

Local digital news sites often have health and retirement content that your audience actively consumes, plus better targeting capabilities. Radio hits them during routine listening, and selective local TV can work for health-focused programming.

We could test performance across formats in month one, then reallocate based on which drives better cost per enrollment in each market.

Now for measurement - with three distinct segments and multiple channels, how do you currently track attribution? Do you have capabilities for incrementality testing, or are we working primarily with last-click and platform reporting?
