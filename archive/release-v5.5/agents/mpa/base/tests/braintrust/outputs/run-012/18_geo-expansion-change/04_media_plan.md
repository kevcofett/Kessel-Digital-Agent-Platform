# Media Plan Output: Geography Expansion Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

I can see you want to drive store visits and online conversions - that's a smart omnichannel approach. To start modeling your plan: what's the primary business outcome you're trying to achieve with these 500,000 interactions? Are you focused on revenue growth, market share expansion, or brand awareness in new segments?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Revenue growth as your primary objective with 500K interactions to hit annual sales goals. Let me work out what this means for efficiency.

$2.5M budget ÷ 500,000 interactions = $5 per interaction (visit/conversion). For athletic apparel, this is quite efficient - typical retail traffic costs run $8-15 per visit.

Now I need to understand your success measurement: what's your primary KPI for tracking revenue success? Are you measuring total revenue generated, conversion rate from these interactions, or average order value? This will help me validate if 500K interactions can realistically deliver your revenue goals.

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent! Let me update our projections with your conversion data.

75,000 purchases × $180 AOV = $13.5M in revenue
$2.5M budget ÷ 75,000 purchases = $33.33 per customer acquisition

For athletic apparel, $33 CAC with $180 AOV gives you a 5.4x return - that's strong efficiency. Your 15% conversion rate assumption is optimistic but achievable for athletic apparel if targeting is precise.

This implies you need traffic that converts at 15%. Mixed online/retail traffic typically converts 8-12%, so you'll need above-average audience quality. The good news: your $5 per interaction budget allows room for premium targeting.

Does your $180 AOV hold consistent across both online and retail partner channels, or do you see differences between digital and in-store purchase behavior?

Turn 4:
Great insight! Let me recalculate with your channel-specific AOVs.

If we assume a 60/40 split (common for athletic brands):
- 45,000 online purchases × $160 AOV = $7.2M
- 30,000 in-store purchases × $200 AOV = $6.0M
- Total: $13.2M revenue (close to our $13.5M projection)

This channel mix affects your media strategy since driving store visits requires different tactics than online conversions. Store visit campaigns often cost 20-30% more due to location targeting complexity.

Your economics still work well - blended CAC of $33 with strong returns from both channels.

Now for audience precision: you mentioned active adults 25-45. With your 15% conversion target, we need high-intent audiences. How do you currently define "active" - is it gym membership, fitness app usage, athletic purchase behavior, or broader lifestyle indicators?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Perfect! Your broad "active" definition captures both performance athletes and athleisure consumers - smart for market expansion. Premium pricing with mid-to-high income targeting supports your $33 CAC efficiency.

Let me model your audience sizing. Active adults 25-45 with fitness engagement and higher income typically represents 12-18% of total population in major metros, dropping to 6-10% in smaller markets.

With 500K interaction targets, we need roughly 3-4 million targetable people nationally (assuming 12-15% reach rates). This suggests focusing on top 50-75 DMAs where your audience concentrates.

What geographic markets are you currently strongest in, and are there specific regions where you want to expand market share? This will help determine if we should weight spend toward proven markets or growth opportunities.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent! Your established West Coast and major metro strength gives us a solid foundation. The Southeast and Texas expansion makes strategic sense - those markets have growing fitness cultures and higher disposable income.

Let me model your geographic allocation. With $2.5M budget:
- Established markets (CA, NY, Chicago, Denver): ~60% = $1.5M
- Expansion markets (Southeast, Texas): ~40% = $1M

This 60/40 split balances growth with proven performance. Expansion markets typically require 15-25% higher CACs initially due to lower brand awareness, but your $1M allocation should drive meaningful penetration.

For Southeast expansion specifically, fitness engagement skews younger (25-35) and more female, while Texas markets show stronger crossover appeal to broader athleisure segments.

Now let's lock in your budget framework: Does $1.5M for established markets and $1M for expansion feel right, or would you prefer a different split between proven performance and growth investment?

Turn 7:
Perfect! Your $1.5M established / $1M expansion allocation is locked in. The geographic insights will definitely shape your creative approach later.

Now let's build your value proposition framework. With premium pricing in competitive athletic markets, your messaging needs to justify the price point while appealing to both performance athletes and athleisure consumers.

Based on your audience and expansion goals, what's your core value proposition? Are you positioning primarily on performance benefits, style/lifestyle appeal, quality/durability, or a combination? Understanding your key differentiator will help determine which messages resonate best in established versus expansion markets.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Excellent positioning! "Where performance meets lifestyle" perfectly captures the dual-use value that justifies premium pricing. You're right that messaging needs to adapt by market maturity.

For established markets: You can lead with lifestyle integration since customers know your performance credentials. Messages around versatility and style evolution work well.

For expansion markets: You'll need to establish performance credibility first, then introduce the lifestyle benefits. Think "proven performance, elevated style" rather than assuming they know your quality.

This affects your creative strategy and channel selection significantly. Performance-first messaging works better in fitness-focused channels, while lifestyle messaging fits broader reach platforms.

Now let's move to channels. With your omnichannel goals (online + retail), geographic split, and dual value proposition, you'll need a mix that drives both immediate conversions and builds brand awareness for expansion.

What channels are you currently using, and which have performed best for driving your target customer interactions?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Great foundation! Meta and Google are smart workhorses for your dual positioning. Let me map your channel strategy to your $2.5M budget and expansion goals.

Current channels work well but you'll need broader reach for Southeast/Texas expansion where brand awareness is low. Here's what I'd recommend:

**Core channels (60% - $1.5M):**
- Google Search: High-intent capture in all markets
- Meta (Instagram/Facebook): Lifestyle positioning, strong for established markets

**Expansion channels (40% - $1M):**
- Connected TV: Premium brand building for expansion markets
- TikTok: Younger Southeast demographic, athleisure trend capture
- Influencer (strategic): Local fitness creators in target expansion markets
- YouTube: Performance demonstration + lifestyle content

CTV and TikTok are particularly strong for your expansion goals - CTV builds premium brand credibility while TikTok captures the younger, style-focused segment growing in Southeast markets.

Does this channel mix align with your growth strategy, or do any of these feel like too big a leap from your current approach?
