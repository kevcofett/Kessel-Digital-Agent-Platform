TURN 1 (Step 1)

USER:
Hi, I'm Head of Marketing at TrustGuard Insurance. We need to build a media plan to drive 25,000 new policy acquisitions with a $5M budget. Our target is homeowners 35-65 with $100K+ household income, particularly those going through life events like buying a home, having a baby, or approaching retirement. LTV is around $2,800.

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect - you've given me strong foundational data. Let me reforecast your efficiency target: $5M ÷ 25,000 policies = $200 per acquisition. With $2,800 LTV, that's a 14:1 LTV:CAC ratio, which is excellent for insurance where 8-12:1 is typical.

Your target is very achievable from an efficiency standpoint. Before we dive deeper into economics, what specific business outcome is driving this 25,000 policy goal? Is this about market share growth, geographic expansion, or hitting a revenue milestone?

Events: calculation_performed, benchmark_cited

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 2 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
That's great to hear the efficiency target looks solid. The 25,000 policy goal is primarily driven by market share growth - we're looking to increase our penetration in the homeowners market against the major national carriers. We've been losing some ground to competitors who've been more aggressive with their digital marketing, so this is really about reclaiming our position and establishing stronger SOV in key markets.

AGENT:
Excellent - market share recapture against national carriers is a clear strategic objective. With your $200 CAC target being conservative for insurance, you're well-positioned to compete aggressively.

Let me confirm your primary success metric: Is it the 25,000 new policies acquired, or would you also track market share percentage in your target markets? And do you have a specific timeframe for achieving these 25,000 acquisitions - is this an annual goal or different timeline?

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 3 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
The primary success metric is definitely the 25,000 new policies - that's what we're being measured on internally. We'd love to track market share percentage as well, but honestly our market share data is a bit spotty across different regions, so the policy count is more reliable for us to measure against.

This is an annual goal - we need to hit these 25,000 acquisitions over the next 12 months. Given the seasonality in our business, we're expecting stronger performance in spring and fall when people are more likely to be buying homes or making major life changes.

AGENT:
Perfect - 25,000 new policies over 12 months with seasonal peaks in spring and fall. That seasonality insight will be crucial for our pacing strategy later.

Let me validate one more piece of your economics: You mentioned $2,800 LTV. Is that the total customer lifetime value, or the first-year value? And do you know what timeframe that LTV represents - is it calculated over 3 years, 5 years, or longer?

This helps me assess if your $200 CAC target accounts for payback period properly.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 4 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
That $2,800 is the total LTV, not first-year value. I believe it's calculated over about 5 years based on our average customer retention, but I'll be honest - I don't have the exact breakdown of how our finance team calculates that figure. Our first-year premium is typically around $1,200-1,400 depending on the policy type, so we're definitely looking at multi-year value to get to that $2,800 number.

AGENT:
Got it. I'll model using the $2,800 LTV over 5 years based on typical insurance calculations. With first-year premiums of $1,200-1,400, that math checks out for homeowners insurance. You can refine this anytime with finance team details.

Your economics look solid: $200 CAC against $2,800 LTV gives you a 14:1 ratio, which is conservative for insurance. Even if payback takes 18-24 months, you have excellent unit economics to compete aggressively for market share.

Moving on, let's define your target audience more precisely. You mentioned homeowners 35-65 with $100K+ income during life events. Of those three life events - home buying, new baby, or approaching retirement - which one represents your highest-converting audience segment?

Events: benchmark_cited, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 5 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Home buying is definitely our highest-converting segment. People shopping for homeowners insurance are actively in-market and have a clear immediate need - they literally can't close on their mortgage without coverage. Our conversion rates are typically 3-4x higher for new homebuyers compared to the other life events. 

The new baby and retirement segments convert well too, but those are more about prompting people to review and potentially switch their existing coverage, so the urgency isn't quite as strong.

AGENT:
Excellent insight - home buyers are your highest-intent audience with 3-4x conversion rates. That urgency and immediate need creates a powerful targeting advantage.

Given that performance difference, how would you prioritize budget allocation across these segments? Should we focus primarily on new home buyers, or do you want a specific split across the three life event audiences?

Also, within that home buying segment, are you targeting people at specific stages - like those who just got pre-approved, are actively house hunting, or are in the closing process?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 6 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I'd say we should allocate about 60-70% of our budget to the home buying segment given those conversion rates. The remaining 30-40% can be split between new baby and retirement segments - they still perform well and help us maintain broader market presence.

For the home buying stages, we typically see the best results targeting people who are actively house hunting or under contract. The pre-approval stage is a bit early since they might not close for months, and by the closing process it's often too late since they may have already secured coverage. We want to catch them when they're serious about a specific property but still have time to shop for insurance.

AGENT:
Perfect - 60-70% to home buyers, 30-40% split between new baby and retirement. Targeting active hunters and those under contract is smart timing.

Let me reforecast based on this allocation: If 65% goes to home buyers ($3.25M), that targets ~16,250 policies at your higher conversion efficiency. The remaining 35% ($1.75M) targets ~8,750 policies from the other segments. This should comfortably hit your 25,000 total.

Now for audience sizing: Do you know roughly how many people are actively house hunting or under contract in your target markets at any given time? This helps us assess if you have sufficient audience scale, or if we need to expand targeting signals beyond just life events.

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 7 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Honestly, I don't have solid numbers on the size of our actively hunting audience at any given time. That's probably something we should have better visibility into. My gut feeling is that we have sufficient scale nationally - there's always a pretty steady flow of people buying homes, especially in our target income bracket.

But you're right to flag this as a potential constraint. We might need to look at expanding our targeting signals beyond just the life events, maybe incorporating home value data, recent mortgage applications, or other behavioral indicators that suggest someone might be in the market for homeowners insurance.

AGENT:
Got it. I'll model using a reasonable assumption that home buying audiences provide sufficient scale nationally for homeowners insurance, based on typical market activity. You can validate this with audience sizing tools once we select channels.

Since scale might be a constraint, expanding beyond pure life events makes sense. Home value data, mortgage applications, and property search behavior could significantly expand your targetable audience while maintaining relevance.

Moving on to geography - you mentioned "key markets" earlier when talking about market share. Are you targeting nationally, or do you have specific states, regions, or DMAs where you want to focus this $5M investment?

Events: benchmark_cited, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 8 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're targeting nationally, but we definitely have some markets where we're stronger and others where we're trying to gain ground. I'd say we should probably weight our spend toward markets where we're underperforming against the major carriers - places like Texas, Florida, and California where the competition has been really aggressive. 

We also do well in the Midwest traditionally, so we don't want to neglect those markets, but the growth opportunity is probably bigger in the Sun Belt states where population growth is strong and we haven't kept pace with market expansion.

AGENT:
Excellent strategy - weight toward underperforming Sun Belt markets while maintaining Midwest presence. Texas, Florida, and California represent huge opportunities with their population growth and home buying activity.

Let me structure your geography targeting with population and audience data. Do you want to focus on specific major DMAs within those states - like Dallas/Houston in Texas, Miami/Tampa in Florida, LA/San Francisco in California - or should we look at broader state-level allocation first and then drill down to metro areas?

Also, roughly what percentage of your $5M should we allocate to these growth markets versus your traditional Midwest strongholds?

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 9 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I think we should focus on the major DMAs within those states - Dallas, Houston, Austin in Texas; Miami, Tampa, Orlando in Florida; and LA, San Diego, San Francisco in California. Those metros have the highest concentration of our target demographic and the most competitive activity.

For budget allocation, I'd suggest putting about 70% toward these growth markets and 30% maintaining our Midwest presence. So roughly $3.5M for the Sun Belt expansion and $1.5M to protect our traditional markets. We need to be aggressive where we're losing ground while not completely abandoning our strongholds.

AGENT:
Perfect - 70% to growth DMAs ($3.5M) and 30% to Midwest strongholds ($1.5M). That's an aggressive but smart allocation to reclaim market share.

Let me build your geography table with the major DMAs you specified:

| Geography | Region | Total Population | Target Audience Size* | Allocation % | Planned Spend |
|-----------|---------|------------------|----------------------|--------------|---------------|
| Dallas-Fort Worth | Sun Belt Growth | 7.6M | ~380K | 12% | $600K |
| Houston | Sun Belt Growth | 7.1M | ~355K | 12% | $600K |
| Los Angeles | Sun Belt Growth | 13.2M | ~660K | 15% | $750K |
| Miami-Fort Lauderdale | Sun Belt Growth | 6.1M | ~305K | 10% | $500K |
| Austin | Sun Belt Growth | 2.4M | ~120K | 8% | $400K |
| Tampa-St. Petersburg | Sun Belt Growth | 3.2M | ~160K | 8% | $400K |
| San Diego | Sun Belt Growth | 3.3M | ~165K | 5% | $250K |
| **Sun Belt Subtotal** | | **42.9M** | **~2.1M** | **70%** | **$3.5M** |
| Midwest Markets** | Traditional | ~25M | ~1.25M | 30% | $1.5M |
| **TOTAL** | | **~68M** | **~3.4M** | **100%** | **$5.0M** |

*Estimated homeowners 35-65, $100K+ income
**Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee, Indianapolis cluster

This gives you $163-$303 spend per target person across markets. Does this geographic allocation align with your market share priorities?

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 10 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
That allocation looks really solid - I like how you've weighted LA and the Texas markets given their size and growth potential. The spend per target person range of $163-$303 seems reasonable for reaching our audience effectively.

One thing I'd consider is maybe bumping up Miami a bit and reducing San Diego slightly - Florida has been particularly competitive lately and we've seen some strong growth opportunities there. But overall this geographic strategy aligns well with where we need to be more aggressive against the national carriers.

AGENT:
Great point on Florida's competitiveness. Let me adjust:

**UPDATED ALLOCATION:**
- Miami-Fort Lauderdale: 12% ($600K) - up from 10%
- San Diego: 3% ($150K) - down from 5%

This gives Miami the same investment level as Dallas and Houston, reflecting the competitive intensity in Florida. San Diego at 3% still maintains presence while focusing firepower on your highest-priority growth markets.

**Updated spend per target person:**
- Miami: ~$197 (was $164)
- San Diego: ~$91 (was $152)

This reallocation puts $100K more into your most competitive growth market. Does this better reflect your market share priorities?

Now let's move to budget structure. You have $5M total. Beyond the geographic split we just defined, how do you typically think about budget allocation - do you separate acquisition from retention marketing, or allocate by campaign type, or structure it differently?

Events: benchmark_cited, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 11 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Perfect, that adjustment to Miami makes a lot of sense - giving it the same weight as Dallas and Houston reflects the competitive reality we're facing in Florida.

For budget structure, this $5M is purely acquisition focused - we have separate retention budgets that come out of a different line item. Within this acquisition budget, I typically think about it by campaign type and funnel stage. We usually allocate maybe 70-80% to performance channels focused on immediate conversions, and then 20-30% to upper funnel brand awareness to support those conversion efforts. The national carriers have been outspending us on brand building, so we need some investment there to stay competitive, but the bulk needs to drive direct response given our policy targets.

AGENT:
Excellent - pure acquisition focus with 70-80% performance, 20-30% brand awareness. That split makes sense for your 25,000 policy goal while building competitive brand presence.

Let me reforecast your budget structure:
- Performance (direct response): 75% = $3.75M targeting ~18,750 policies at $200 CAC
- Brand awareness (upper funnel): 25% = $1.25M supporting conversion efficiency

This keeps you aggressive on immediate conversions while investing in brand building to compete with national carriers' SOV.

Before we dive into channels, what's your core value proposition against those major competitors? When someone is comparing TrustGuard to State Farm or Allstate, what's your primary differentiator - is it price, service, coverage options, local expertise, or something else?

Events: calculation_performed

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 12 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our main differentiator is really our personalized service combined with competitive pricing. We're not the cheapest option out there, but we're typically 10-15% below the major carriers while offering much more personalized attention. Our agents actually get to know their clients instead of just being order-takers in a call center.

We also have some unique coverage options that the big guys don't offer - things like guaranteed replacement cost and extended water damage protection that really matter to homeowners. But honestly, our biggest advantage is that people can actually reach a human who knows their account when they need help. The national carriers have gotten so automated that customers feel like just a policy number.

AGENT:
Perfect - personalized service at 10-15% savings with unique coverage features. That's a strong value proposition against automated national carriers.

Your messaging framework should emphasize "Real agents who know you, real savings you can count on" - leading with the human connection since that's hardest for nationals to replicate, then reinforcing with price advantage and coverage benefits.

Now let's build your channel strategy. Given your 75% performance / 25% brand split and your target audiences, I'm thinking:

**Performance channels (75% - $3.75M):**
- Search (Google/Bing) for high-intent home buyers
- Social (Meta) for life event targeting
- Programmatic display for retargeting

**Brand channels (25% - $1.25M):**
- Connected TV for reach and frequency
- YouTube for awareness

Which of these channels do you currently use, and are there any you'd definitely want to include or avoid?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 13 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're currently using search pretty heavily - that's been our bread and butter for years and performs well. We've dabbled in Meta but haven't really optimized it for life event targeting like you're suggesting. Programmatic display we've tested but never scaled significantly.

For brand, we've been doing some traditional TV but haven't moved much into Connected TV yet, which is probably a missed opportunity. YouTube makes sense too - we've seen competitors doing well there. I'd definitely want to keep search as our anchor channel since it captures that high-intent traffic so well, but I'm open to shifting more budget toward the social and CTV opportunities where we've been underinvesting compared to the national carriers.

AGENT:
Smart approach - search as your proven anchor with expansion into underutilized channels where nationals are gaining advantage.

Let me model your channel allocation based on that strategy:

**PERFORMANCE CHANNELS ($3.75M - 75%)**
- **Search (Google/Bing): 45% ($2.25M)** - Your proven anchor for high-intent traffic
- **Meta Social: 20% ($1M)** - Scale life event targeting properly  
- **Programmatic Display: 10% ($500K)** - Retargeting and prospecting

**BRAND CHANNELS ($1.25M - 25%)**
- **Connected TV: 15% ($750K)** - Premium reach in target DMAs
- **YouTube: 10% ($500K)** - Video awareness and competitor parity

This keeps search dominant while meaningfully investing in your growth channels. At these investment levels:
- Search can target ~11,250 policies ($200 CAC)
- Meta can optimize life event audiences with $1M
- CTV gets minimum viable investment for impact

Does this channel mix feel right for competing more aggressively with the nationals?

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 14 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Yes, this channel mix looks really solid. I like that you've kept search at 45% since that's where we know we can drive volume reliably. The $1M investment in Meta should give us enough scale to really optimize those life event audiences properly - we've never had that kind of budget to work with there before.

The Connected TV allocation at $750K feels about right for making a meaningful impact without overcommitting to something we haven't tested extensively yet. And having YouTube in the mix helps us compete where the nationals have been gaining ground. This gives us a good balance between doubling down on what works and expanding into the growth opportunities we've been missing.

AGENT:
Excellent - this channel mix positions you well to reclaim market share while maintaining your proven search performance.

Now for measurement. With your $5M investment across these channels, what's your current measurement setup? Do you have:

1. **Attribution tracking** - Can you see which channels are driving policy applications and conversions?
2. **Incrementality testing capability** - Can you run holdout tests to measure true channel impact?
3. **Brand tracking** - Any way to measure awareness lift from your CTV and YouTube investment?

Understanding your measurement infrastructure helps ensure we can properly optimize and prove ROI on this aggressive investment against the nationals.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 15 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our attribution tracking is pretty solid for search since we've been doing that for years - we can track from click to policy application to binding. But honestly, our cross-channel attribution is probably where we're weakest. We use Google Analytics and some internal tracking, but when someone sees a CTV ad and then converts through search, we're not great at connecting those dots.

We don't really have incrementality testing capability set up right now - that's something I know we should be doing but haven't invested in the infrastructure for. And brand tracking is basically non-existent beyond some quarterly surveys we do. Given the investment we're making in CTV and YouTube, we probably need to get better measurement in place to justify the spend and optimize performance.

AGENT:
You've identified the critical measurement gaps. With $1.25M in brand investment, you need infrastructure to prove and optimize that spend.

Here's what I recommend implementing:

**IMMEDIATE (Month 1-2):**
- **Multi-touch attribution** platform (Google Analytics 4 enhanced or third-party like Triple Whale)
- **Brand search lift tracking** - Monitor branded search volume increases after CTV/YouTube campaigns
- **Geo-testing framework** - Use your DMA structure for incrementality testing

**MONTH 3-6:**
- **Holdout testing** for CTV - Test markets with/without CTV to measure true lift
- **Brand awareness tracking** - Quarterly surveys in your key DMAs to measure share of voice

**ONGOING:**
- **Weekly cross-channel reporting** showing assist value from brand channels

Without this measurement foundation, you'll struggle to optimize your $5M investment and prove ROI to leadership. Should we build measurement requirements into the campaign launch timeline?

Now let's discuss testing strategy. What aspects of this plan would you want to test first before scaling?
