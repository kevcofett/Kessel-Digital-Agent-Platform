# Media Plan Output: Behavioral Targeting Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

I can see you want to acquire 50,000 new subscribers with an $800K budget. Let me calculate what this implies: $800,000 ÷ 50,000 = $16 per subscriber. With $420 LTV, that's a 26:1 LTV to CAC ratio - extremely efficient for subscription business where 3-5:1 is typical.

This target is very aggressive. Most nutrition subscription brands see $40-80 acquisition costs. To hit $16, you'd need exceptional conversion rates and low-cost traffic sources.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 50,000 new subscribers?

Turn 2:
Perfect - capturing market share for funding rounds is a clear strategic outcome. Let me reforecast with more realistic efficiency.

At typical nutrition subscription CAC of $40-80 per subscriber:
- At $40 CAC: $800,000 ÷ $40 = 20,000 subscribers 
- At $80 CAC: $800,000 ÷ $80 = 10,000 subscribers

Even at the efficient end, you're looking at 20,000-25,000 subscribers rather than 50,000. This would generate $8.4M-$10.5M in LTV - still substantial for your funding story.

The aggressive growth strategy makes sense, but the math suggests either increasing budget to $1.6M-$2M for 50,000 subscribers, or targeting 20,000-25,000 subscribers with your $800K.

What's your primary KPI for measuring success - total subscriber count, revenue generated, or something else?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - 20,000 subscribers at $40 CAC creates a compelling investor narrative with strong unit economics. That's a 10.5:1 LTV to CAC ratio, showing you can scale profitably while maintaining aggressive growth.

Let me confirm Step 1 is complete:
- **Outcome**: Demonstrate growth momentum for funding round
- **Primary KPI**: New subscriber count 
- **Target**: 20,000 subscribers
- **Budget efficiency**: $40 CAC ($800K total)

This generates $8.4M in LTV - substantial growth story with sustainable economics.

Now for Step 2 - let's validate this $40 CAC target is achievable. Based on your $420 LTV, what's your contribution margin per subscriber after fulfillment costs? This helps determine how much you can actually afford to spend on acquisition while maintaining healthy unit economics.

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using $275 contribution margin (midpoint of your $250-300 range) based on your estimate. You can refine this anytime with finance team data.

$275 contribution margin with $40 CAC gives you a 6.9:1 contribution to CAC ratio - that's excellent for subscription business where 3:1+ is healthy. This validates your $40 target is not just achievable but leaves good margin for profitability.

Your economics check out well:
- $40 acquisition cost
- $275 contribution over 2 years  
- $235 profit per subscriber
- 20,000 subscribers = $4.7M total contribution

The $40 CAC target is realistic and profitable. Ready to move to Step 3 and define your target audience more precisely than "fitness enthusiasts 25-55"?

Turn 5:
Excellent - endurance athletes are a much more precise audience than general fitness enthusiasts. These are people with specific nutrition needs and proven willingness to invest in performance optimization.

Let me build on that definition. Within endurance athletes, there are some key segments to consider:

- **Training intensity**: Weekend warriors vs. competitive athletes vs. elite/semi-professional
- **Sport focus**: Runners, cyclists, triathletes each have different nutrition patterns
- **Experience level**: Beginners discovering sports nutrition vs. experienced users switching brands

For efficient $40 CAC targeting, we need to prioritize the highest-converting segments first.

Which endurance athlete segment do your current best customers fall into - recreational enthusiasts training for events, or more competitive athletes focused on performance gains?

Turn 6:
Perfect - recreational endurance athletes training for events is a goldmine audience. They have clear motivation (upcoming events), proven commitment (structured training), and lifestyle integration potential.

This audience has some powerful targeting advantages:
- **Event-driven urgency**: Training cycles create natural conversion windows
- **Education-receptive**: They research nutrition extensively during training
- **Community-connected**: Often part of running clubs, cycling groups, triathlon teams
- **Lifecycle predictable**: Training seasons and event calendars create targeting opportunities

For efficient acquisition, we can layer in behavioral signals like recent race registrations, training app usage, or sports nutrition purchases.

How large is your current subscriber base of these recreational event-training athletes, and do you have data on their demographics beyond the 25-55 age range?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 7:
Excellent data - 5,600-6,400 of your current base fits this profile, which validates the audience. The seasonal patterns and 12-16 week event windows are gold for targeting efficiency.

Let me refine the audience definition:

**Primary Target**: Recreational endurance athletes, ages 30-50, higher household income, training for specific events (marathons, century rides, sprint tris). Even gender split, slightly male-leaning.

**Key Behavioral Signals**: 
- Recent race registrations
- Training app engagement 
- Sports nutrition purchase history
- Running/cycling group membership

The seasonal timing insight is crucial - we can align acquisition with training cycle starts for maximum conversion efficiency.

How geographically concentrated are your current subscribers? Are they clustered in certain regions, or fairly distributed across the US?

Turn 8:
Perfect geographic insight. The 60/40 split between endurance hotspots and broader markets gives us clear targeting priorities for efficient $40 CAC achievement.

**Primary Markets** (60% concentration): Colorado, California, Pacific Northwest, Northeast corridor - established endurance communities with higher event density and sports nutrition adoption.

**Secondary Markets** (40% distribution): Major metros nationwide with active running/cycling clubs.

This geographic concentration is ideal for media efficiency - we can focus initial spend on proven high-conversion markets before expanding.

Now let's move to Step 5 budget allocation. With your $800K total budget and these geographic priorities, how would you prefer to weight the spending - heavily front-load the primary endurance markets, or distribute more evenly to test broader market potential?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 9:
Smart allocation strategy. Let me break down the math:

**Primary Markets (70%)**: $560K targeting proven endurance hotspots
- At $40 CAC = 14,000 subscribers 
- Lower risk, proven conversion rates

**Secondary Markets (30%)**: $240K for metro expansion testing
- At $40 CAC = 6,000 subscribers
- Higher learning potential, scalability insights

This gives you flexibility to reallocate based on performance while prioritizing efficient acquisition where you know it works.

Now for Step 6 - your value proposition. You mentioned subscribers want "consistent nutrition support throughout training cycles." Beyond product delivery, what specific value do you provide that competitors don't? Is it personalized nutrition plans, expert guidance, event-specific fueling strategies, or something else that resonates with these event-training athletes?

Turn 12:
Great question - you're absolutely right to challenge the CTV allocation. That's exactly the kind of strategic thinking that protects your $40 CAC target.

CTV for endurance athletes is more experimental, and at your efficiency requirements, we need proven performance over experimentation. Let me reforecast:

**Revised Tier 2 (30% - $240K)**
- **Facebook/Instagram**: $180K (up from previous)
- **CTV Test**: $60K (reduced experimental budget)

Or we could eliminate CTV entirely and reallocate:
- **Google Search**: $480K (20% increase for peak training periods)
- **YouTube Educational**: $120K (50% increase for content marketing)

Given your $40 CAC constraint and proven performance needs for the funding round, would you prefer the conservative reallocation to double down on search and YouTube, or keep a small CTV test at $60K?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Excellent - that training-cycle personalization is a powerful differentiator that directly addresses the specific needs of your target audience. Most competitors treat nutrition as static, but you're treating it as dynamic and event-specific.

**Core Value Proposition**: "Nutrition that evolves with your training" - personalized product delivery and education matched to training phases and event types.

This creates strong retention because the value increases as events approach, and it's highly relevant messaging for acquisition during those 12-16 week training windows.

Ready for Step 7 - channel strategy? Given your $40 CAC target, personalized value prop, and event-driven audience behavior, which channels are you currently using or considering? We need to match channels to where endurance athletes research nutrition during their training cycles.

Turn 11:
Excellent thinking on training app partnerships - that's where intent is highest. Let me break down the channel strategy for your $800K budget and $40 CAC target:

**Tier 1 - High Intent Channels (50% - $400K)**
- **Google Search**: Captures "marathon nutrition," "triathlon fueling" research
- **Training App Partnerships**: Strava/TrainingPeaks integration during training cycles
- **YouTube**: Educational content targeting event-specific searches

**Tier 2 - Audience Building (30% - $240K)**
- **Facebook/Instagram**: Retarget website visitors, lookalikes of current subscribers
- **Connected TV**: Reach endurance athletes during sports programming

**Tier 3 - Community Integration (20% - $160K)**
- **Podcast Sponsorships**: Endurance sports podcasts
- **Event Marketing**: Marathon expos, triathlon events
- **Influencer Partnerships**: Endurance athlete ambassadors

The key is timing - heavy search investment during peak registration periods (12-16 weeks before major events), with social for year-round nurturing.

Does this channel mix align with where you see your audience spending time during training cycles?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 13:
Perfect decision - eliminating experimental spend protects your funding round metrics. Here's the finalized allocation:

**Final Channel Strategy ($800K)**
- **Google Search**: $480K (60%) - Peak training cycle targeting
- **YouTube Educational**: $120K (15%) - Training-specific content
- **Facebook/Instagram**: $180K (22.5%) - Retargeting and lookalikes  
- **Community Integration**: $20K (2.5%) - Podcast sponsorships

This conservative approach maximizes budget in proven high-intent channels while supporting your training-cycle value proposition.

Now for Step 8 - measurement. Beyond subscriber count and CAC, what specific metrics will you track to prove campaign success to investors? Are you measuring things like subscriber quality, retention rates, or LTV by acquisition channel to show the sustainability of your growth?

Turn 15:
Smart prioritization - event-specific landing pages will amplify performance across all channels driving search traffic. Small conversion improvements on 60% of your budget create massive CAC impact.

**Testing Priority 1: Event-Specific Landing Pages**
- Marathon nutrition (peak spring/fall testing)
- Triathlon fueling (summer season focus)  
- Century ride preparation (spring/summer)

Each page showcases training-cycle customization for that specific event, directly proving your value prop to high-intent visitors.

**Testing Timeline**: Launch during peak registration windows when search volume spikes. Test messaging variations around training phases versus event-day performance.

For Step 10 - risk mitigation, what concerns you most? Seasonal demand fluctuations affecting your 20,000 subscriber target, competitive response to your growth push, or platform dependency with 60% budget in Google Search?

Turn 16:
Excellent risk identification - those are the exact issues that could derail your funding round metrics.

**Risk Mitigation Strategy:**

**Seasonal Risk**: Build 20% budget flexibility to shift spending during peak seasons (spring/fall marathon training). Track leading indicators like race registration trends to predict demand cycles.

**Google Dependency**: Reserve 15% contingency budget ($120K) for rapid channel reallocation if search CPCs spike. Monitor keyword costs weekly and have Facebook/YouTube campaigns ready to scale.

**Competitive Response**: Your training-cycle personalization creates 6-12 month lead time for competitors to replicate. Focus on building subscriber base quickly while advantage exists.

**Monitoring Triggers**: 
- Search CPC increases >25% = activate contingency reallocation
- 90-day retention drops below 85% = audience quality issue
- Seasonal volume drops >30% = accelerate peak season spend

This gives you a solid $800K plan targeting 20,000 subscribers at $40 CAC with quality metrics that tell a compelling investor story. Ready to execute?

Turn 17:
Excellent - you've built a robust plan that balances aggressive growth with smart risk management. The monitoring triggers and contingency planning will definitely resonate with investors as evidence of strategic execution capability.

For spring marathon timing, you'll want to launch 12-16 weeks before major spring races (Boston Marathon is April 21, so peak registration is typically December-January). That means launching in early January to catch the training cycle starts.

**Recommended Timeline:**
- **December**: Finalize unit economics with finance, build event-specific landing pages
- **Early January**: Launch with heavy search focus for spring training cycles  
- **February-March**: Peak spend during training intensification
- **April**: Analyze performance, prepare for fall marathon season

This timing captures the strongest conversion window and gives you solid performance data for your funding conversations by Q2.

Great work building this plan - you now have a clear path to 20,000 subscribers with defendable unit economics and quality metrics that tell a compelling growth story.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 14:
Excellent measurement framework - you're thinking like an investor. Quality metrics will differentiate your growth story from competitors who just chase volume.

**Core Measurement Framework:**
- **Primary**: Subscriber count, CAC by channel
- **Quality**: 90-day retention by channel, LTV by source
- **Engagement**: Training-cycle feature usage, customization adoption
- **Predictive**: Feature usage correlation to retention

The channel LTV comparison is especially powerful. If search subscribers show $450+ LTV versus $420 average, that validates your channel strategy and suggests $40 CAC is actually conservative.

For Step 9 - testing approach, what would you want to test first? Event-specific landing pages during peak training seasons, different educational content formats on YouTube, or audience targeting refinements within your proven channels?
