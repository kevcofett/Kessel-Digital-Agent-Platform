TURN 1 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Hi! I'm looking to get more people to buy shoes from our online store. Can you help me figure out the best way to do that?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with your shoe store? For example, are you looking to get more customers, increase sales from existing customers, or something else?

TURN 2 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We mainly want to get more new customers to try our shoes. Our sales have been pretty flat lately and we need to grow our customer base. I think if we can get people to discover us and make their first purchase, they'll come back for more shoes later.

AGENT:
Perfect! Getting new customers is a clear growth objective. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success.

What number would tell you this campaign worked? For example, how many new customers do you want to acquire, or what sales revenue are you targeting from these new customers?

TURN 3 (Step 3)

USER:
We haven't really set a specific number yet, but I'd say if we could get maybe 1,000 to 2,000 new customers that would be great? Our average shoe price is around $80, so that could bring in decent revenue. I'm honestly not sure what's realistic with our budget though - what do you think makes sense?

AGENT:
That's helpful! Let's work with 1,500 new customers as a target - right in your range. At $80 average price, that's $120,000 in new customer revenue.

To figure out what's realistic, I need to know your budget. How much are you planning to spend on advertising to get these new customers?

TURN 4 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We have about $250,000 to spend on this. I know that sounds like a lot, but we really want to make a big push to grow. Does that seem like enough to get the 1,500 new customers we're talking about?

AGENT:
Let me update our projections. $250,000 ÷ 1,500 customers = $167 per customer. 

That's actually quite generous for shoe retail! Typical cost per customer runs $50-80 in this industry. At $167, you have room for premium targeting or could potentially get many more customers than 1,500.

A few options: You could target 3,000+ customers at typical $80 efficiency, or stick with 1,500 but use the extra budget for higher-quality channels and audiences.

What matters more - getting the maximum number of new customers, or being more selective about the quality of customers you acquire?

TURN 5 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Wow, 3,000 customers sounds amazing! I guess I'd rather get more customers if we can. I mean, if we can get double the customers for the same budget, that seems like a no-brainer, right? What do you mean by higher-quality customers though - wouldn't more customers always be better?

AGENT:
Great question! More customers isn't always better - it depends on what those customers are worth to you long-term.

Higher-quality customers typically buy more shoes over time, return less often, and cost less to serve. Lower-cost acquisition might bring customers who only buy once or return items frequently.

To figure out the right approach, I need to understand your economics better. What profit do you typically make on that $80 shoe sale after covering the cost of the shoes, shipping, and other expenses?
