TURN 1 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I'm the Director of Performance Marketing at LuxeFinance, a wealth management firm. We need to build a precision media plan to acquire high-net-worth individuals - specifically people with $1M+ in investable assets, typically 45-65, executives and business owners who are either approaching retirement or have a major liquidity event coming up. We're interested in people researching tax optimization and estate planning. Budget is $1.5M, targeting 2,500 qualified leads. We have CRM data on 50K existing clients we can use for modeling. Focus on top DMAs by HNW concentration - NYC, SF, LA, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Denver, Miami, Dallas, DC. Quality matters more than volume here.

AGENT:
Hi! I am excited to build a media plan with you. We will cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've provided excellent detail. Let me clarify your primary business outcome: Are you targeting 2,500 qualified leads that convert to initial consultations, or 2,500 new client acquisitions with assets under management?

The distinction matters because lead-to-client conversion rates for HNW prospects typically run 8-15%, which would significantly impact our efficiency modeling and measurement approach.

TURN 2 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're targeting 2,500 qualified leads - specifically MQLs that convert to initial consultations. Our sales team handles the conversion from there, and honestly our lead-to-client conversion rates are probably in that 8-15% range you mentioned, though I'd need to pull the exact numbers from our CRM. The key is getting high-intent prospects who actually show up for scheduled consultations rather than tire-kickers.

AGENT:
Perfect. Let me model your efficiency target: $1.5M ÷ 2,500 qualified leads = $600 per lead.

For HNW lead generation, this is aggressive. Wealth management typically sees $800-1,500 per qualified lead based on the precision required and audience exclusivity. At $600, you're targeting 25-50% better efficiency than market typical.

This is achievable but requires tight execution - your CRM data for lookalike modeling will be crucial, and we'll need channels that excel at intent capture rather than broad awareness.

What's your primary KPI for measuring success - cost per qualified lead at $600, or do you have a different success metric in mind?

TURN 3 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Yeah, $600 per qualified lead is the target, though I appreciate you flagging that it's aggressive. We're willing to be flexible if the data shows we need to adjust - I'd rather hit 2,000 high-quality MQLs at $750 each than 2,500 mediocre ones at $600. 

Our primary KPI is definitely cost per qualified lead, but we also track consultation show-rate and eventual AUM conversion. If we're seeing strong show rates above 85% and good downstream metrics, we might have room to increase the CPL target.

AGENT:
Excellent approach - quality over volume makes perfect sense for HNW. Let me update: flexible target of 2,000-2,500 qualified leads at $600-750 CPL, optimizing for consultation show-rates above 85%.

This gives us a working range of $1.2M-1.875M total spend, with your $1.5M budget sitting right in the middle. The 85% show-rate target is strong - typical wealth management sees 60-75%, so this confirms we need precision targeting.

One key economics question: Do you have a target for what percentage of consultation-attending leads eventually become clients? Even a rough range helps me model the full funnel ROI and ensure our lead quality standards align with your downstream conversion expectations.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 4 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I'd estimate we're converting somewhere around 12-15% of consultation attendees into actual clients, though that can vary pretty significantly based on market conditions and the size of assets they're bringing over. Our top advisors might hit 20% conversion rates with the right prospects, but company-wide I think 12-15% is realistic. 

The key is making sure we're attracting people who are actually ready to make a move - not just browsing or comparison shopping endlessly.

AGENT:
Perfect. Let me validate the full funnel economics:

2,500 leads → 2,125 consultations (85% show) → 275 new clients (13% conversion)

At $600 CPL, that's $5,455 per new client acquisition. For wealth management with average AUM of $1M+, this is very strong economics - most firms see $8K-15K fully-loaded acquisition costs.

Your efficiency target is realistic because you have two key advantages: 50K client CRM for precise lookalike modeling, and focus on high-intent prospects researching tax optimization and estate planning rather than broad wealth management awareness.

The economics work well. Ready to move to Step 3 and define your audience precision targeting - starting with those behavioral signals around tax optimization and estate planning research?

TURN 5 (Step 5)

USER:
Yes, let's dive into the audience targeting. Those behavioral signals are exactly what we need to focus on. Our first-party data shows existing clients typically research topics like "tax-loss harvesting," "estate tax planning," "charitable giving strategies," and "succession planning" before engaging with us. 

We also see strong signals around major life events - people searching for financial advisors after selling a business, receiving an inheritance, or approaching retirement age. The key is catching them when they're actively researching these topics, not just passively consuming general financial content.

AGENT:
Excellent behavioral intelligence. Your first-party research patterns give us precise intent signals to target.

Let me build our audience framework:

**High-Intent Behavioral Signals:**
- Tax optimization research (tax-loss harvesting, estate tax planning)
- Wealth transfer planning (charitable giving, succession planning)
- Liquidity event signals (business sale, inheritance, retirement planning)

**Life Event Triggers:**
- Business exit preparation
- Inheritance receipt
- Pre-retirement (typically 5-7 years out for your demographic)

With your 50K client CRM, we can create lookalike models based on these research patterns. 

What's the typical timeline between when prospects start researching these topics and when they're ready for consultation? Understanding their research-to-decision window helps us optimize for the right stage of intent.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 6 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
From our CRM analysis, the research-to-decision window varies quite a bit. For tax optimization and estate planning, we typically see 3-6 months of active research before they engage. But liquidity events move much faster - business owners preparing for a sale might research for 6-12 months beforehand, but once they have proceeds in hand, they often move within 30-60 days.

The inheritance crowd is interesting - they usually start researching immediately after receiving assets but take 2-4 months to actually pull the trigger on changing advisors. Pre-retirement planning has the longest cycle - sometimes 12-18 months of research before they're ready to consolidate with a new wealth manager.

AGENT:
Perfect insight - this gives us three distinct audience tiers with different urgency levels:

**Tier 1 - Hot Prospects (30-60 days):** Post-liquidity event, inheritance recipients
**Tier 2 - Warm Prospects (3-6 months):** Active tax/estate planning research  
**Tier 3 - Long Nurture (12-18 months):** Pre-retirement consolidation planning

Your CRM data can segment lookalikes by these research timelines. Tier 1 gets aggressive spend for immediate capture, Tier 2 gets consistent presence during research phase, Tier 3 gets brand building with periodic activation.

For your 45-65 executive/business owner demographic across those 10 top HNW DMAs, what's your estimate of total addressable audience size? Even a rough sense helps determine if we have sufficient scale to hit 2,500 leads or if we need broader targeting.

TURN 7 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Honestly, I don't have a precise TAM number off the top of my head, but based on our current client acquisition patterns and market research, I'd estimate we're looking at maybe 150,000-200,000 qualified prospects across those top 10 DMAs who fit our demographic and asset criteria. 

The challenge isn't necessarily scale - it's reach and frequency within that audience. These HNW individuals are notoriously hard to reach through traditional channels, which is why we're focusing on LinkedIn, financial publisher direct buys, and contextual placements where they're already consuming relevant content. We might need to expand our targeting slightly to ensure we hit volume targets, but I'd rather start tight and expand than go too broad initially.

AGENT:
Smart approach - 150K-200K TAM gives us good scale. At 2,500 leads, we're targeting 1.25-1.67% conversion from total addressable market, which is realistic for precision targeting.

Your channel instincts align perfectly with HNW behavior - LinkedIn for professional targeting, financial publishers for contextual relevance, and content-adjacent placements for quality reach.

The reach challenge is real - HNW individuals have ad avoidance behaviors and limited media consumption patterns compared to mass market.

One critical audience question: Within your three tiers, do you see meaningful differences in media consumption or platform preferences? For example, do post-liquidity prospects behave differently online than pre-retirement planners, or can we use consistent channel strategies across all urgency levels?

TURN 8 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Good question. From what we've observed, there are some notable differences in media consumption patterns across the tiers. 

Post-liquidity prospects - especially business owners who just sold - tend to be very active on LinkedIn and consume a lot of financial news content. They're researching actively and clicking through to resources. Pre-retirement planners are more passive - they're heavy podcast listeners and prefer longer-form content from trusted financial publishers. The inheritance crowd falls somewhere in between but tends to gravitate toward more educational content and webinars.

We'll probably need channel-specific creative and messaging strategies, but the core platforms should work across all three tiers. LinkedIn and financial publisher direct will be our workhorses regardless of urgency level.

AGENT:
Excellent behavioral mapping. This gives us clear channel-tier alignment:

**Post-liquidity (Tier 1):** LinkedIn + financial news sites for active research capture
**Pre-retirement (Tier 2):** Podcast advertising + long-form publisher content 
**Inheritance (Tier 3):** Educational content hubs + webinar promotion

All tiers benefit from LinkedIn and financial publishers, but with different creative approaches - urgent vs. educational vs. nurturing messaging.

Your audience precision is strong. Ready to move to geography and confirm your DMA prioritization? With $1.5M budget across 10 markets, we're looking at roughly $150K per DMA, but I suspect you'll want to weight toward NYC, SF, and LA based on HNW concentration. 

What's your thinking on geographic budget allocation?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 9 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
You're absolutely right - we definitely want to weight toward the top HNW concentration markets. I'm thinking something like 40% of budget to the big three - NYC, SF, and LA - so roughly $600K there. Then maybe 35% to the next tier of Chicago, Boston, Seattle, and DC, and the remaining 25% split between Denver, Miami, and Dallas.

NYC is our biggest opportunity market, so I'd probably allocate around $250K there alone. SF and LA could each get $175K. The HNW density just makes the CPMs worth it in those markets, even though they're expensive. We've seen our best client LTV come from those three DMAs historically.

AGENT:
Perfect allocation strategy. Let me map this out:

**Tier 1 (40% - $600K):** NYC $250K, SF $175K, LA $175K
**Tier 2 (35% - $525K):** Chicago, Boston, Seattle, DC at ~$131K each
**Tier 3 (25% - $375K):** Denver, Miami, Dallas at ~$125K each

This weighting makes complete sense - you're paying premium CPMs where HNW density justifies it. NYC at $250K reflects the market opportunity.

One geographic consideration: At these budget levels per DMA, we'll have sufficient scale for optimization in each market. Tier 2 markets at $131K each can support meaningful LinkedIn and publisher campaigns, while Tier 3 at $125K allows for focused testing.

Ready to move to your value proposition development? Given the three audience tiers and their different urgency levels, how do you typically position LuxeFinance differently to post-liquidity prospects versus pre-retirement planners?
