# Media Plan Output: Precision Targeting with Complex Attributes

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I am excited to build a media plan with you. We will cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've provided excellent detail. Let me clarify your primary business outcome: Are you targeting 2,500 qualified leads that convert to initial consultations, or 2,500 new client acquisitions with assets under management?

The distinction matters because lead-to-client conversion rates for HNW prospects typically run 8-15%, which would significantly impact our efficiency modeling and measurement approach.

Turn 2:
Perfect. Let me model your efficiency target: $1.5M ÷ 2,500 qualified leads = $600 per lead.

For HNW lead generation, this is aggressive. Wealth management typically sees $800-1,500 per qualified lead based on the precision required and audience exclusivity. At $600, you're targeting 25-50% better efficiency than market typical.

This is achievable but requires tight execution - your CRM data for lookalike modeling will be crucial, and we'll need channels that excel at intent capture rather than broad awareness.

What's your primary KPI for measuring success - cost per qualified lead at $600, or do you have a different success metric in mind?

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Excellent approach - quality over volume makes perfect sense for HNW. Let me update: flexible target of 2,000-2,500 qualified leads at $600-750 CPL, optimizing for consultation show-rates above 85%.

This gives us a working range of $1.2M-1.875M total spend, with your $1.5M budget sitting right in the middle. The 85% show-rate target is strong - typical wealth management sees 60-75%, so this confirms we need precision targeting.

One key economics question: Do you have a target for what percentage of consultation-attending leads eventually become clients? Even a rough range helps me model the full funnel ROI and ensure our lead quality standards align with your downstream conversion expectations.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 4:
Perfect. Let me validate the full funnel economics:

2,500 leads → 2,125 consultations (85% show) → 275 new clients (13% conversion)

At $600 CPL, that's $5,455 per new client acquisition. For wealth management with average AUM of $1M+, this is very strong economics - most firms see $8K-15K fully-loaded acquisition costs.

Your efficiency target is realistic because you have two key advantages: 50K client CRM for precise lookalike modeling, and focus on high-intent prospects researching tax optimization and estate planning rather than broad wealth management awareness.

The economics work well. Ready to move to Step 3 and define your audience precision targeting - starting with those behavioral signals around tax optimization and estate planning research?

Turn 5:
Excellent behavioral intelligence. Your first-party research patterns give us precise intent signals to target.

Let me build our audience framework:

**High-Intent Behavioral Signals:**
- Tax optimization research (tax-loss harvesting, estate tax planning)
- Wealth transfer planning (charitable giving, succession planning)
- Liquidity event signals (business sale, inheritance, retirement planning)

**Life Event Triggers:**
- Business exit preparation
- Inheritance receipt
- Pre-retirement (typically 5-7 years out for your demographic)

With your 50K client CRM, we can create lookalike models based on these research patterns. 

What's the typical timeline between when prospects start researching these topics and when they're ready for consultation? Understanding their research-to-decision window helps us optimize for the right stage of intent.

Turn 6:
Perfect insight - this gives us three distinct audience tiers with different urgency levels:

**Tier 1 - Hot Prospects (30-60 days):** Post-liquidity event, inheritance recipients
**Tier 2 - Warm Prospects (3-6 months):** Active tax/estate planning research  
**Tier 3 - Long Nurture (12-18 months):** Pre-retirement consolidation planning

Your CRM data can segment lookalikes by these research timelines. Tier 1 gets aggressive spend for immediate capture, Tier 2 gets consistent presence during research phase, Tier 3 gets brand building with periodic activation.

For your 45-65 executive/business owner demographic across those 10 top HNW DMAs, what's your estimate of total addressable audience size? Even a rough sense helps determine if we have sufficient scale to hit 2,500 leads or if we need broader targeting.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 7:
Smart approach - 150K-200K TAM gives us good scale. At 2,500 leads, we're targeting 1.25-1.67% conversion from total addressable market, which is realistic for precision targeting.

Your channel instincts align perfectly with HNW behavior - LinkedIn for professional targeting, financial publishers for contextual relevance, and content-adjacent placements for quality reach.

The reach challenge is real - HNW individuals have ad avoidance behaviors and limited media consumption patterns compared to mass market.

One critical audience question: Within your three tiers, do you see meaningful differences in media consumption or platform preferences? For example, do post-liquidity prospects behave differently online than pre-retirement planners, or can we use consistent channel strategies across all urgency levels?

Turn 8:
Excellent behavioral mapping. This gives us clear channel-tier alignment:

**Post-liquidity (Tier 1):** LinkedIn + financial news sites for active research capture
**Pre-retirement (Tier 2):** Podcast advertising + long-form publisher content 
**Inheritance (Tier 3):** Educational content hubs + webinar promotion

All tiers benefit from LinkedIn and financial publishers, but with different creative approaches - urgent vs. educational vs. nurturing messaging.

Your audience precision is strong. Ready to move to geography and confirm your DMA prioritization? With $1.5M budget across 10 markets, we're looking at roughly $150K per DMA, but I suspect you'll want to weight toward NYC, SF, and LA based on HNW concentration. 

What's your thinking on geographic budget allocation?

Turn 9:
Perfect allocation strategy. Let me map this out:

**Tier 1 (40% - $600K):** NYC $250K, SF $175K, LA $175K
**Tier 2 (35% - $525K):** Chicago, Boston, Seattle, DC at ~$131K each
**Tier 3 (25% - $375K):** Denver, Miami, Dallas at ~$125K each

This weighting makes complete sense - you're paying premium CPMs where HNW density justifies it. NYC at $250K reflects the market opportunity.

One geographic consideration: At these budget levels per DMA, we'll have sufficient scale for optimization in each market. Tier 2 markets at $131K each can support meaningful LinkedIn and publisher campaigns, while Tier 3 at $125K allows for focused testing.

Ready to move to your value proposition development? Given the three audience tiers and their different urgency levels, how do you typically position LuxeFinance differently to post-liquidity prospects versus pre-retirement planners?
