# Media Plan Output: Full 10-Step Media Planning

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with a quick calculation based on what you've shared. $750K ÷ 15,000 customers = $50 per customer acquisition cost. For home decor, that's aggressive - typical runs $60-100. Achievable, but will require tight targeting and efficient channels.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 15,000 new customers?

Turn 2:
Perfect - sustainable revenue growth with repeat customers is a smart objective. That focus on lifetime value will help justify your aggressive $50 CAC target.

To measure success, what's your primary KPI? Are you tracking total revenue from these 15,000 customers, or something else like 12-month customer lifetime value?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - $450 LTV against $50 CAC gives you a 9x return, which is strong for home decor. Tracking both immediate revenue and 12-month LTV is smart for sustainable growth.

Let me update our model: 15,000 customers × $450 LTV = $6.75M in total customer value from this campaign. That's solid economics that justify the investment.

What's your revenue target from these 15,000 new customers in their first purchase?

Turn 4:
Perfect! $2.5M ÷ 15,000 = $167 AOV confirms your math. With $450 LTV and $167 first purchase, you're projecting strong repeat behavior - customers spending nearly 3x their initial purchase over time.

Your economics look solid:
- $50 CAC vs $450 LTV = 9x return
- $167 immediate revenue covers CAC by 3.3x
- Strong repeat purchase foundation

This aggressive efficiency target is achievable with your strong unit economics, but will require precise audience targeting and efficient channel selection.

Now let's define who we're targeting. Who is your ideal customer for home decor and furniture?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Great profile - homeowners 30-55 with renovation mindset and social media engagement. That aligns well with home decor purchasing patterns.

Let me dig deeper on one key segment. You mentioned new homeowners, renovators, and empty nesters. Which of these three groups converts best for you, or do they perform similarly?

Turn 6:
Perfect - new homeowners and active renovators with urgency and multi-room potential. That immediate need creates the buying momentum to hit your aggressive $50 CAC.

What behavioral signals help you identify these high-intent customers? For example, are they searching for specific terms, visiting certain pages, or showing other behaviors that indicate they're in that active buying phase?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Excellent behavioral signals - room solution searches, multi-category browsing, and engagement with transformation content all indicate purchase intent and urgency.

The before-and-after engagement is particularly valuable since it shows they're visualizing their own space transformation. Combined with wish list activity, these are strong conversion predictors.

What geographic areas are you targeting? Are you focusing nationally, regionally, or in specific markets?

Turn 8:
Smart focus - top 20 metros driving 70% of revenue shows clear concentration of your target audience. Those major metros align perfectly with your homeowner demographic and higher disposable income requirements.

Since you're getting strong performance in established metros, we can likely achieve your aggressive $50 CAC by concentrating spend in proven markets rather than testing broader geography.

What's your current budget allocation between these top-performing metros versus secondary markets? Are you looking to double down on what's working or expand the geographic footprint?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Smart strategic thinking - focusing 85-90% on proven metros is the right call for your aggressive $50 CAC target. Secondary market testing at 10-15% gives you expansion data without jeopardizing the main goal.

Let me update our model: $750K × 85% = $637K for top metros where you have proven efficiency. That gives you the best shot at 15,000 customers while maintaining a small expansion budget.

Now for budget allocation - you mentioned the $750K total. Is this purely for media spend, or does it include creative production, platform fees, and other campaign costs?

Turn 10:
Perfect - $750K in pure media spend gives you maximum efficiency toward that $50 CAC target. With creative handled separately, we can focus the entire budget on customer acquisition.

Let me confirm our economics: $750K ÷ 15,000 customers = $50 CAC, driving $2.5M immediate revenue and $6.75M lifetime value. Strong foundation.

What's your key value proposition that differentiates HomeStyle Decor? What makes customers choose you over competitors when they're furnishing or renovating?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 11:
Excellent value proposition - "curated collections with styling confidence" solves the overwhelm problem that stops many home decor purchases. The free design consultations are particularly smart for your price point and customer profile.

This positioning should resonate strongly with your new homeowner and renovator segments who need complete solutions quickly. The styling guidance reduces purchase anxiety, which helps conversion rates.

Now let's determine your channel strategy. Based on your audience (social-savvy homeowners), proven metros, and transformation-focused messaging, what channels are you currently using or considering?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 12:
Great channel foundation - visual platforms align perfectly with your transformation content and social-savvy audience. Pinterest is particularly underutilized given your audience behavior there.

Let me model your current performance to optimize the mix. What are your current CACs by channel? For example, what are you typically paying per customer on Facebook/Instagram versus Google Search?

Turn 13:
Excellent data - Facebook/Instagram at $45-55 and Pinterest at $40-50 are both below your $50 target, while Google Search at $60-75 is above but brings high-intent traffic.

Here's the strategic opportunity: Pinterest at $40-50 CAC with your audience's high engagement there suggests significant scale potential. Facebook/Instagram are proven performers in your sweet spot.

For your $750K budget targeting $50 blended CAC, I'd recommend:
- 45% Facebook/Instagram ($337K) - proven performance
- 30% Pinterest ($225K) - scale the $40-50 efficiency  
- 20% Google Search ($150K) - high-intent despite higher CAC
- 5% testing budget ($38K)

This mix should deliver 15,000+ customers under budget. How does this allocation feel against your current approach?

Turn 14:
Smart adjustment - let's model your comfort level. 45% Facebook/Instagram, 25% Pinterest, 25% Google, 5% testing:

$750K allocation:
- Facebook/Instagram: $337K ÷ $50 = 6,740 customers
- Pinterest: $188K ÷ $45 = 4,180 customers  
- Google: $188K ÷ $67.5 = 2,785 customers
- Testing: $37K ÷ $60 = 620 customers

Total: 14,325 customers - about 675 short of your 15,000 target.

To hit 15,000, you'd need either 5% better efficiency across channels or about $50K more budget. The Pinterest scale-up could deliver that efficiency gain as you optimize.

How important is hitting exactly 15,000 versus building confidence in the new channel mix?

Turn 15:
Perfect strategic thinking - sustainable optimization over aggressive targeting. Building confidence in Pinterest's scalability creates long-term value beyond this campaign.

At 14,325 customers × $167 AOV = $2.39M immediate revenue (96% of your $2.5M target) with strong efficiency foundation. As Pinterest optimizes, you'll likely exceed targets naturally.

Now for measurement - beyond tracking CAC by channel, what other metrics will help you optimize performance and prove campaign success to leadership?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 10: Risks

Turn 16:
Excellent measurement framework - you're thinking like a true performance marketer. Tracking LTV and repeat purchase by channel will reveal whether Pinterest's lower CAC delivers equal customer quality to Facebook/Instagram.

The 90-day repeat purchase metric is particularly smart for home decor since customers often furnish room-by-room. Engagement on transformation content will help optimize creative strategy.

One addition: given your aggressive CAC target, I'd recommend incrementality testing to validate true lift beyond platform-reported attribution. Meta and Google can inflate ROAS through view-through attribution.

Now for testing strategy - with your 5% testing budget ($37K), what would you prioritize? Influencer partnerships, TikTok, or other opportunities?

Turn 17:
Perfect split - $25K influencer, $12K TikTok. Influencer partnerships align beautifully with your transformation content and authentic social proof strategy. Those room makeover collaborations should drive strong engagement with your renovation audience.

TikTok at $12K gives you meaningful testing volume for quick transformation videos while managing risk on an unproven platform.

Finally, let's identify the key risks that could derail this plan. What concerns you most - competition increasing costs, seasonal fluctuations, platform changes, or something else?
