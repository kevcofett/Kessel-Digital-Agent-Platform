# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience Unified Media Plan

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build this multi-segment media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've provided excellent segment detail upfront. Let me start with outcomes: Beyond the 25,000 total enrollees, what's the primary business outcome you're trying to achieve? Are you focused on premium revenue growth, market share in specific segments, or customer lifetime value optimization?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So premium revenue growth is your primary objective with market share gains in urban metros as secondary. 

For your primary KPI measuring success, would you track total annual premium revenue from these 25,000 new enrollees, or do you prefer a different metric like average revenue per enrollee across segments?

Also, what's your target for total annual premium revenue from these 25,000 enrollees? This helps me assess if your $3M acquisition budget creates realistic efficiency targets.

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Let me run those numbers. At your premium targets:
- Families: $2,400/month = $28,800 annually  
- Young professionals: $180/month = $2,160 annually
- Pre-Medicare: $350/month = $4,200 annually

To hit $45-50M in annual premiums, you'd need roughly:
- 1,200-1,400 families ($35-40M)
- 2,300-2,800 young professionals ($5-6M) 
- 2,400-2,800 pre-Medicare ($10-12M)

This gives you $3M budget ÷ 25,000 enrollees = $120 average cost per acquisition.

For health insurance, typical acquisition costs run $150-300 per enrollee. At $120, you're targeting 20-60% better efficiency than market benchmarks. This is aggressive but achievable with precise targeting - families justify higher acquisition costs due to their premium value.

The math works if you can achieve tight efficiency. Ready to dive into your audience strategy to see how we can hit these targets?

Turn 5:
Perfect signals. So Young Professionals: ages 26-35, $60K+ income, urban metros, life transition triggers (job changes, aging off parents' plans), fitness/wellness engagement, meal delivery users, concentrated neighborhoods.

Now for your Families segment (ages 35-50, suburban, kids under 18): What behavioral patterns help identify families most likely to switch to your higher-tier plans? Do they research during specific times like open enrollment periods, or are there family life events that trigger insurance shopping?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Excellent. Let's build precise audience definitions for each segment to hit that $120 efficiency target.

Starting with your Young Professionals (ages 26-35, urban metros): Beyond gym membership and digital preference, what other behavioral signals help identify your ideal prospects? For example, do they typically research health insurance during specific life events, show interest in wellness apps, or have particular income thresholds that predict enrollment?

The more behavioral signals we can layer, the tighter our targeting becomes for that segment.

Turn 6:
Great detail. Families: ages 35-50, $75K+ income, suburban, kids under 18, seasonal triggers (Q4 AEP, back-to-school), life events (new baby, school starts, network changes), heavy researchers, parenting content engagement, pediatric specialist searches.

For your Pre-Medicare segment (ages 55-64, heavy in FL/AZ/TX): What behavioral signals best identify prospects approaching that Medicare transition? Do they research insurance differently than your other segments, and are there specific concerns or content topics that indicate purchase intent?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Excellent. Pre-Medicare: ages 55-64, national with FL/AZ/TX concentration, $50K+, fixed/decreasing incomes, 12-18 month research cycles, network stability focus, prescription coverage priority, retirement planning engagement, Medicare supplement searches, provider network verification, prefer phone consultations.

Now let's look at geography. You mentioned urban metros for Young Professionals and suburban markets around top 50 metros for Families. 

For Young Professionals, should we focus budget on the tier-1 metros (NYC, SF, LA, Chicago) where competition is highest, or include tier-2 cities where you might achieve better efficiency? And for Families, are there specific suburban markets within those top 50 metros that have shown stronger performance for you?

Turn 8:
Perfect geographic focus. So Young Professionals: tier-1 metros (NYC, SF, LA, Chicago) for market share plus tier-2 cities (Austin, Denver, Seattle) for efficiency. Families: proven suburban markets (Northern VA, Orange County, suburban Atlanta, DFW suburbs) where comprehensive coverage resonates.

Now let's tackle budget allocation. With $3M total and your premium value differences, how are you thinking about splitting budget across the three segments? 

Given that families generate $28,800 annual premiums vs $2,160 for young professionals, should we weight budget heavily toward families even if their acquisition costs are higher, or do you want to balance volume across segments?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Smart allocation. Let me validate that math:
- Families: $1.5M at ~$225 CAC = 6,700 enrollees × $28,800 = $193M annual premiums
- Pre-Medicare: $750K at ~$150 CAC = 5,000 enrollees × $4,200 = $21M annual premiums  
- Young Professionals: $750K at ~$90 CAC = 8,300 enrollees × $2,160 = $18M annual premiums

Total: 20,000 enrollees generating $232M in annual premiums - well above your $45-50M target.

This allocation prioritizes immediate revenue impact while building future pipeline through young professionals. The efficiency targets look achievable given your strong audience signals.

Ready to develop your value propositions for each segment? Each will need distinct messaging given their different priorities and research behaviors.
