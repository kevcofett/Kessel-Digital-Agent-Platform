# Media Plan Output: Aggressive KPI - Must Narrow to Achieve

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Perfect! I can see you have strong unit economics with 16x LTV:CAC at your target. Let me validate your efficiency target against market realities.

$750K ÷ 5,000 customers = $150 CAC target. For B2B SaaS logistics, typical CAC runs $180-$280 based on industry benchmarks. Your $150 target is 17% below the low end - aggressive but achievable with precise targeting and channel efficiency.

Your SMB logistics audience (50-500 employees, $5M-$50M revenue, spreadsheet-dependent) is well-defined, which helps hit aggressive targets.

Now for the critical question: Is this $150 a fully-loaded CAC including all marketing costs, or acquisition-only CAC excluding overhead and team costs?

This distinction affects whether we model conservatively at $150 all-in, or can allocate the full $750K to media with additional efficiency buffer.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Excellent clarity - that changes everything. Let me recalculate:

$150 fully-loaded CAC × 75% media allocation = $112.50 per customer for media
5,000 customers × $112.50 = $562,500 available for media spend

Now we're targeting $112.50 media CAC, which is 38% below typical B2B SaaS benchmarks of $180-$280. This is highly aggressive and will require exceptional execution.

At this efficiency level, you'll need:
- Laser-focused targeting within your SMB logistics niche
- Strong first-party data or lookalikes if available
- Tight creative-audience fit highlighting spreadsheet pain points
- Likely focus on highest-intent channels initially

Before we dive into audience precision - do you have existing customer data we could use for lookalike targeting, or would this be primarily cold prospecting to your defined firmographic criteria?

Turn 3:
Smart thinking - lookalikes from 800 customers with quality firmographic data is exactly what you need for $112 CAC efficiency. Freight brokerage and 3PL clustering gives you strong signal for platform algorithms.

Your instinct is correct: cold prospecting at $112 would be extremely challenging. Lookalikes typically deliver 40-60% better efficiency than cold audiences for B2B SaaS.

With your customer data quality, I'd model:
- 1% lookalikes from best customers: $90-120 CAC range
- Cold prospecting to firmographics: $150-200+ CAC range

The math favors lookalike-heavy strategy, with cold prospecting only for scale once lookalikes prove out.

Quick validation: Of your 800 customers, roughly what percentage would you classify as high-value or ideal customer profile? This helps us size the lookalike seed audience and estimate how much volume we can efficiently drive before needing broader targeting.

Turn 4:
Excellent - 480-520 high-value customers is a strong lookalike foundation. That seed size should generate substantial addressable audience on major platforms.

Let me model the volume potential:
- 500 seed customers → 1% lookalike ≈ 2-4M addressable audience
- At $100 blended CAC from lookalikes: 4,000-4,500 customers achievable
- Remaining 500-1,000 customers need cold prospecting at higher CACs

This creates a feasible path to 5,000 customers within your efficiency constraints.

Now for geography - are you targeting US-wide, or focusing on specific regions where logistics density is higher? Markets like freight corridors (Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas) often have better B2B conversion rates but smaller addressable audiences.

This geographic decision directly impacts whether we can efficiently reach 5,000 customers or need to expand targeting to hit volume goals.

Turn 5:
Perfect strategic thinking. Let me model this geography approach:

Tier 1 markets (Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, LA, NYC/NJ corridor):
- 70% of current customers suggests strong product-market fit
- Lookalike audiences: ~1.5-2.5M addressable (reduced from 4M national)
- Expected efficiency: $85-110 CAC (10-15% better than national)
- Projected volume: 3,000-3,500 customers from tier 1 lookalikes

Gap analysis: Need 1,500-2,000 additional customers
Options: Expand to tier 2 markets or broader targeting in tier 1

The math works - you can likely hit 60-70% of your volume in core markets at better efficiency, then strategically expand. This de-risks the plan versus trying to hit $112 CAC nationally from day one.

Now let's lock in your budget allocation. You mentioned $562,500 for media spend. Should we reserve any portion for testing tier 2 markets, or allocate the full amount assuming geographic expansion as needed?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 7:
Smart call - 4,000 customers at proven efficiency beats 5,000 with blown CACs. 5x growth is exceptional scale, and proving the model sets you up for bigger budgets later.

Let me finalize the economics:
- Target: 4,000 customers 
- Media budget: $562,500
- Blended CAC: $140 (within your $150 fully-loaded target)
- Revenue impact: 4,000 × $2,400 LTV = $9.6M lifetime value

This gives you a compelling story: efficient growth with 17x LTV:CAC and room for optimization.

Now let's define your audience precision. You mentioned freight brokers and 3PLs as your highest-value segments. For the lookalike targeting, should we build separate lookalikes for each vertical, or one blended audience from your best 500 customers across both segments?

Separate audiences give more precision but smaller scale. Blended gives broader reach but potentially less efficiency.

Turn 9:
Absolutely - outcome-focused messaging is exactly right for $140 CAC efficiency. ROI and time savings resonate much stronger than feature lists at your target level.

Let me structure the value propositions:

**Freight Brokers:**
Primary: "Stop losing margin to manual load matching - our customers see 25% efficiency gains in 90 days"
Pain amplifier: "Every hour in spreadsheets = missed high-margin loads"
Proof point: Automated optimization vs. manual rate calculations

**3PLs:**
Primary: "Give clients real-time visibility they demand - 30% faster reporting in 90 days" 
Pain amplifier: "Excel dashboards lose clients to competitors with modern tracking"
Proof point: Professional client portals vs. spreadsheet updates

Both lead with quantified outcomes (25%, 30%, 90 days) that justify the investment decision.

For creative testing, should we A/B the specific percentages, or do you have stronger case studies we could reference? Concrete customer stories often outperform generic efficiency claims in B2B.

Turn 10:
Perfect - those case studies are conversion gold at your efficiency targets. Real customer stories with specific locations and metrics blow away generic claims.

**Refined Value Propositions:**

**Freight Brokers:**
"Dallas broker went from 50 to 85 loads/day with same team - 70% more throughput in 4 months"
Pain hook: "While competitors max out at 50 loads, you could be processing 85"

**3PLs:** 
"Chicago 3PL cut reporting from 8 hours to 2 hours/week - added 3 clients without new hires"
Pain hook: "Stop losing clients to competitors who deliver real-time updates"

Both stories show clear ROI path and competitive advantage. The specificity (Dallas, Chicago, exact numbers) builds instant credibility.

Ready for Step 7 - Channels? With your lookalike strategy and these value props, we need to select platforms that can efficiently reach logistics decision-makers. LinkedIn seems obvious for B2B, but Meta might surprise with lookalike performance. Should we model a channel mix or do you have platform preferences based on past performance?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent allocation strategy. Let me confirm the math:

Core tier 1 markets: $450K targeting 3,000-3,500 customers = $129-150 CAC
Expansion testing: $112K for 1,500-2,000 customers = $56-75 CAC needed

Wait - that expansion efficiency looks too aggressive. Let me recalculate:

If tier 1 delivers 3,500 customers at $129 CAC, you need 1,500 more customers from $112K expansion budget = $75 CAC required. That's unrealistic for tier 2 markets.

More realistic scenario:
- Tier 1: $450K → 3,200 customers at $140 CAC  
- Expansion: $112K → 800 customers at $140 CAC
- Total: 4,000 customers, 1,000 short of goal

This suggests either increasing total budget to $675K+ or accepting 4,000 customers as a more achievable target given your efficiency constraints.

Which direction makes more sense - push for additional budget or adjust volume expectations?

Turn 8:
Excellent segmentation strategy. The use case differences absolutely justify separate targeting:

Freight brokers (300 seeds): Load optimization, tech-forward = higher intent signals
3PLs (200 seeds): Warehouse ops, multi-client complexity = different pain points

Both seed sizes work well for 1% lookalikes. This approach gives you:
- Vertical-specific performance data for optimization
- Ability to shift budget toward higher-performing segment
- Creative messaging tailored to each use case
- Option to blend audiences if scale demands it

Budget allocation by vertical:
- Freight brokers: ~$340K (60% of $562K)
- 3PLs: ~$222K (40% of $562K)

This mirrors your customer mix and lets you test which vertical delivers better efficiency at scale.

Ready to move to Step 6 - Value Proposition? We need to define the core messaging framework that will drive those lookalike conversions, especially how you position against spreadsheets and legacy TMS systems for each vertical.

Turn 12:
Perfect approach - $225K gives Meta a real test, and you're right that reallocating is always an option if performance diverges significantly from targets.

**Final Channel Strategy:**
- LinkedIn: $337K → 2,000 customers at $168 CAC (proven performance)
- Meta: $225K → 2,000 customers at $112 CAC (lookalike test)
- 3-week checkpoint for reallocation decisions

This balances proven performance with meaningful testing of your efficiency hypothesis.

Moving to Step 8 - Measurement. With two distinct channels and verticals, we need clear KPIs to track success. Beyond the obvious CAC tracking, what attribution window makes sense for your sales cycle? And should we measure freight broker vs. 3PL performance separately to optimize budget allocation between verticals?

Also - do you have proper UTM tracking and CRM integration set up to measure true conversion performance, or do we need to account for attribution gaps in our efficiency calculations?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 11:
Smart channel allocation thinking. Let me model this mix against your $562K budget:

**LinkedIn (60% = $337K):** 
- Higher intent, proven performance with logistics managers
- Higher CPMs but better conversion rates
- Target: ~2,000 customers at $168 CAC

**Meta (40% = $225K):**
- Lower CPMs, strong lookalike potential  
- Volume play with efficiency upside
- Target: ~2,000 customers at $112 CAC

**Blended target:** $140 CAC across 4,000 customers

The math works if Meta lookalikes can hit that $112 efficiency. That's aggressive but possible given your strong seed data.

On Google Search - you're right to be cautious. "TMS software" and "logistics software" keywords are $15-25 CPCs. You'd need 15%+ conversion rates to hit $140 CAC, which is unlikely for cold search traffic.

Should we allocate 70% LinkedIn/30% Meta to be more conservative, or test your 60/40 split and shift budget based on week 2-3 performance data?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 13:
Excellent measurement framework. 60-day attribution captures your full cycle, and tracking velocity metrics alongside CAC gives you lead quality insights that pure efficiency metrics miss.

**Measurement Dashboard:**
- Primary: CAC by channel × vertical (4 combinations)
- Secondary: Time to MQL, MQL→SQL rates by source
- Tertiary: 60-day revenue attribution, blended performance

The velocity tracking is smart - faster-moving leads often have higher LTV even at higher acquisition costs.

Moving to Step 9 - Testing. With your aggressive efficiency targets, we need structured testing to optimize quickly. Should we A/B test the customer story creative (Dallas broker vs. Chicago 3PL) within each vertical, or test broader messaging approaches like outcome-focused vs. pain-focused?

Also, given your 3-week reallocation checkpoint, what's the minimum performance threshold where you'd shift budget between LinkedIn and Meta? Need clear decision criteria before launch.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 14:
Perfect testing framework and reallocation logic. Clear thresholds prevent emotional decisions.

**Testing Structure:**
- Freight Brokers: Dallas story vs. generic efficiency messaging
- 3PLs: Chicago story vs. generic visibility messaging
- Decision criteria: 150+ conversions minimum, 25% CAC variance triggers reallocation

**Reallocation Triggers:**
- LinkedIn >$210 CAC (25% over $168 target) → shift to Meta
- Meta >$140 CAC (25% over $112 target) → shift to LinkedIn  
- Meta <$90 CAC (20% under target) → increase Meta allocation
- Minimum 150 conversions per channel for statistical significance

This gives you data-driven optimization without premature budget shifts.

Final step - Step 10: Risks. Your biggest risk is Meta lookalikes not delivering $112 CAC efficiency. If that happens, you'd need LinkedIn to carry the full load at $140 CAC, which means perfect execution. Should we identify backup scenarios now, or other risks that could derail the plan?
