# Media Plan Output: Mass National Campaign - Simplicity Test

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

For your FreshBite Snacks launch, I want to make sure we define success precisely. You mentioned brand awareness, but what specific business outcome are you ultimately trying to achieve? Are you looking to drive trial purchases, increase market share, or establish brand recognition for future sales growth?

Turn 2:
Perfect! That 60/40 split between recognition and trial gives us clear direction. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success as a number.

For the brand recognition piece, what specific metric will you track? Are you looking for aided awareness, unaided awareness, or brand consideration lift? And what's your target - for example, moving from X% to Y% awareness?

For trial, will you measure that through household penetration, first-time purchase rates, or velocity in retail locations?

Turn 4:
Perfect! Your aggressive targets are ambitious but achievable with the right strategy. Now let's define your audience precisely to maximize both awareness reach and trial efficiency.

You mentioned adults 18-54 who buy snacks - that's about 130M people. For a new snack launch, high-performing campaigns typically layer 15-20 targeting signals to find the most receptive audiences within that broad group.

Starting with the basics: within that 18-54 range, are there specific age segments that over-index for your snack category? For example, do you see stronger purchase intent among 25-34 year-olds versus 45-54 year-olds based on your research or category data?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent! So we're targeting aided awareness lift from 5% to 15-20% and 8-10% household penetration. Let me check if your $8M budget aligns with those ambitious goals.

$8M against 130M US households (18-54) = roughly $62 per household reached. For a new brand launch targeting 15-20% awareness lift, industry benchmarks typically require $40-80 per household depending on category competition and media mix. You're in the right range.

For 8-10% household penetration (10-13M households), that implies roughly $600-800 cost per penetrating household. This is aggressive but achievable for snacks if we balance broad reach for awareness with targeted frequency for trial.

The math works, but hitting both targets simultaneously will require precise audience strategy. Does this efficiency assessment align with your expectations, or should we adjust either the targets or budget allocation?

Turn 5:
Excellent insights! That 25-44 core with 25-34 driving trial and 35-44 driving frequency is a strong foundation. Let's add behavioral layers to sharpen targeting within that broad awareness reach.

Beyond age, what shopping or lifestyle behaviors best predict someone will try FreshBite? For example, do your ideal customers tend to shop at specific retailers, follow health trends, have kids, or show particular snacking patterns that we could target?

Turn 6:
Perfect! So we're targeting health-conscious families who shop premium but practical - that's a well-defined segment. Within the US, are there specific regions or markets where FreshBite performs particularly well, or where this premium family demographic is most concentrated?

For a national launch, some brands see stronger performance in coastal metros, suburban markets, or specific DMAs where their target audience over-indexes. Do you have any geographic insights from your existing product lines or category research?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 8:
Perfect! $8M working media with separate creative budget gives us full flexibility. Now let's define what makes FreshBite compelling to drive that trial behavior.

For your health-conscious families who are willing to pay more for quality, what's your core value proposition? What specific benefits or differentiators will convince someone to choose FreshBite over established snack brands when they're shopping at Target or Whole Foods?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Excellent geographic strategy! Weighting toward high-performing suburban/coastal markets while maintaining national baseline coverage is smart for balancing efficiency with brand-building reach.

Now let's validate your $8M budget allocation. With your geographic weighting strategy, I'd estimate roughly 60% of budget ($4.8M) concentrated on high-performing markets and 40% ($3.2M) for baseline national coverage. 

Given your dual objectives - does this split make sense, or would you prefer a different allocation between your concentrated markets versus national baseline? Also, is this $8M your total media budget, or do you have additional budget for creative development and production?

Turn 11:
Excellent! Your channel mix gives us the foundation to hit both objectives. Now let's set up measurement to track success across awareness and trial.

You mentioned brand lift studies for awareness tracking. For the trial component, how will you measure household penetration progress? Are you planning to use retail scanner data, household panel data like Nielsen, or first-party purchase tracking?

Also, will you be measuring incrementality to isolate media impact from baseline growth and other marketing activities?

Turn 12:
Perfect measurement framework! Nielsen panels plus retail scanner data will give you comprehensive trial tracking, and holdout markets are the gold standard for incrementality measurement.

Now let's design your testing strategy to optimize performance. With $8M over six months, what's your appetite for dedicating budget to test different creative approaches, audience segments, or channel allocations? 

For example, would you reserve 10-15% of budget ($800K-$1.2M) for testing different versions of your "real ingredients, real flavor" messaging, or testing audience variations within your core 25-44 demographic?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
"Real ingredients, real flavor" is a compelling positioning that hits the sweet spot for your target families. That balance of health-conscious without sacrificing taste is exactly what drives trial in your demographic.

Now let's build your channel strategy. With $8M for dual objectives of awareness (60%) and trial (40%), plus your geographic weighting, we need channels that can deliver both broad reach and targeted engagement.

For building national brand recognition while driving trial in your core suburban/coastal markets, what's your instinct on channel priorities? Are you thinking traditional reach vehicles like TV, digital video platforms, or a more integrated approach across multiple touchpoints?

Turn 10:
Excellent strategic thinking! Your instinct for integrated reach with targeted trial activation is spot-on. Let me model the optimal mix for your dual objectives.

For awareness + trial with $8M, I'd recommend roughly 65% traditional TV/CTV ($5.2M) and 35% digital ($2.8M). Here's the logic:

TV delivers the broad reach needed for 15-20% awareness lift - you'll need ~800-900 GRPs nationally. CTV bridges traditional reach with digital targeting in your core markets. 

Your digital allocation could split: 40% YouTube ($1.1M) for dual-duty reach/trial, 35% targeted display ($1M) for trial activation in suburban/coastal markets, 25% social ($700K) for engagement with health-conscious families.

This gives you national awareness foundation while concentrating trial drivers where your audience over-indexes. Does this weighting feel right for FreshBite's launch strategy?

Turn 14:
Those are exactly the right risks to flag. Let me suggest mitigation strategies for both:

**Competitive Response:** With your $8M concentrated in 6 months, you're creating meaningful share-of-voice in your launch window. I'd recommend front-loading 60% of budget in months 1-3 to establish brand presence before competitors can react. Also, your "real ingredients, real flavor" positioning is defensible - harder for big CPG to pivot messaging quickly than launch competing products.

**Retail Execution:** This is critical. I'd recommend coordinating media flighting with retail calendar - pulse spending around key retail moments and ensure your trade team confirms shelf placement before media launches in each market. Consider geo-targeting your digital spend to stores with confirmed placement first.

You've built a strong plan: $8M driving 15-20% awareness lift and 8-10% household penetration through integrated TV/digital, with smart testing and measurement. The 65/35 traditional/digital split with geographic weighting should deliver both broad recognition and targeted trial.

Ready to move forward with this strategy?

Turn 15:
Excellent! You've built a comprehensive launch strategy that balances ambitious goals with smart execution. Your $8M plan should deliver meaningful brand recognition and trial for FreshBite's new line.

**Quick recap of your winning strategy:**
- 65/35 traditional/digital split targeting 15-20% awareness lift and 8-10% household penetration
- Geographic weighting (60/40) to optimize efficiency while maintaining national presence  
- Front-loaded spending to establish market presence before competitive response
- Creative testing prioritizing health vs. taste messaging to optimize trial conversion
- Retail-coordinated flighting to ensure shelf availability matches media investment

Your instinct to aim high initially while building in testing and flexibility shows strong strategic thinking. With Nielsen tracking, holdout markets, and retail scanner data, you'll have the measurement framework to optimize as you learn.

Best of luck with the FreshBite launch! This foundation should drive both the broad awareness and targeted trial you need to establish the brand successfully.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 13:
Given your dual objectives, I'd prioritize testing the creative approaches first. Here's why: with 60% awareness and 40% trial goals, your messaging balance is critical. Testing parent-focused health benefits versus kid-focused taste appeal will reveal which drives stronger trial conversion within your broad awareness reach.

I'd recommend an 80/20 split of that $800K: $640K testing the health-versus-taste creative across your full channel mix, and $160K testing audience variations (younger kids families vs. older kids families) within your top-performing markets.

The creative test will inform your entire campaign optimization, while the audience test helps refine targeting efficiency in markets that already over-index for FreshBite.

Finally, let's identify key risks. What concerns you most about this launch - competitive response, retail execution, or something else that could impact your awareness and trial targets?
