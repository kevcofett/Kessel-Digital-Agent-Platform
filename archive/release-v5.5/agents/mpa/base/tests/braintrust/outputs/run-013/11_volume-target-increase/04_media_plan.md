# Media Plan Output: Volume Target Increase

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've given me great detail already. Let me check the math: $400K ÷ 5,000 customers = $80 per customer acquisition cost. With $320 LTV, that's a 4:1 ratio - solid for home goods where 3-4:1 is typical.

To confirm our business outcome: You want to acquire 5,000 new customers to drive growth. Is customer acquisition the primary objective, or are there other business outcomes like brand awareness or market expansion that matter equally?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect! Customer acquisition is your primary objective with 5,000 new customers as the target. Your $80 CAC target is well-positioned for home goods.

Now let's validate the economics. You mentioned $320 LTV - is that the full lifetime value or just first-year value? And what's your typical profit margin on orders? 

This matters because we need to ensure your $80 acquisition cost leaves enough contribution margin to justify the spend and fund growth.

Turn 3:
Let me work through the math to confirm this is solid.

At 42% margin on $320 LTV = $134 lifetime gross profit per customer. Spending $80 to acquire leaves $54 net profit per customer. That's a healthy 1.7:1 profit-to-acquisition ratio.

For home goods, this is conservative and sustainable - many brands operate closer to 1.2-1.5:1. Your economics give you room to be competitive in auctions while maintaining profitability.

Your plan is financially sound. Ready to move to defining your target audience?

Turn 4:
Excellent foundation! Homeowners 30-55 interested in home décor is a solid start. Let's get more precise to improve your targeting efficiency.

Within that 30-55 homeowner group, are there specific life stages or situations that drive higher purchase intent? For example, recent movers, new homeowners, people renovating, or families with growing children?

Understanding the trigger moments when people actively shop for home goods will help us target your best prospects.

Turn 5:
Perfect! Those are high-intent life stage triggers with strong purchase urgency. Recent movers, new homeowners, and renovation projects create immediate need rather than browsing behavior.

Now for geographic focus: Are you targeting nationally, or are there specific regions, states, or metro areas where HomeStyle Direct performs better? 

Understanding your geographic sweet spots will help us allocate that $400K budget most efficiently across markets.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 7:
Great thinking on reserving test budget. For your situation, I'd recommend this allocation:

**Main Campaign Budget: $320K (80%)**
- Proven tactics with your high-intent audiences
- Broad national reach with suburban emphasis
- Core platforms where home goods typically perform

**Test & Optimization Budget: $80K (20%)**
- New market testing in those high-growth metros
- Audience refinement experiments
- Creative and messaging tests

This gives you substantial scale while preserving flexibility. The 20% test budget lets you validate assumptions about markets and audiences, then shift budget toward winners in real-time.

Now let's define your value proposition. What makes HomeStyle Direct different from competitors like Wayfair or West Elm? Understanding your unique positioning will shape our messaging strategy.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
With $400K nationwide, you have solid coverage - that's roughly $8 per 1,000 people, which allows meaningful presence across markets.

Suburban focus makes sense for home goods. Without regional performance data, I'd recommend starting with a broad national approach, then optimizing toward high-performing metros as data comes in.

We can use platform data to identify where recent movers and renovation activity are highest - typically growing suburban markets in states like Texas, Florida, North Carolina, and Colorado show strong home goods demand.

Ready to confirm your budget allocation approach? We'll want to reserve some budget for testing and optimization as we learn which markets perform best.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Excellent positioning! "Affordable quality with fast shipping" hits the sweet spot for your high-intent audiences. Recent movers and renovators need solutions quickly, and 3-5 day delivery is a real competitive advantage.

Your curated selection angle is smart too - decision fatigue is real when people are furnishing homes.

Key messaging themes emerging:
- **Speed**: "Get your space ready fast" - perfect for movers/renovators
- **Quality-Value**: "Premium look without premium price"  
- **Curation**: "Carefully chosen, not overwhelming"

Now let's build your channel strategy. Given your $320K main budget, target audiences, and fast-delivery value prop, what channels are you currently using or considering? This will help me recommend the optimal mix for reaching recent movers and renovators efficiently.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Great foundation! Meta + Google Shopping is a solid core, and Pinterest makes perfect sense for home décor inspiration.

Let me analyze your current mix and suggest optimizations:

**Current Performance Assessment:**
Meta is likely driving discovery and consideration, Google Shopping captures purchase intent, Pinterest builds inspiration. That covers the customer journey well.

**Key Addition to Consider:**
**Google Search (non-Shopping)** - Recent movers actively search for "furniture for new home," "home décor ideas," "living room setup." This captures high-intent keywords your Shopping ads might miss.

**Recommended Allocation from $320K:**
- Meta: $140K (44%) - Scale your proven performer
- Google Search + Shopping: $120K (37%) - Capture full search intent
- Pinterest: $40K (13%) - Inspiration and upper funnel  
- Testing Reserve: $20K (6%) - Try YouTube or Connected TV for awareness

Does this align with what you're seeing from current performance? And are there any channels you've considered but haven't tried yet?

Turn 10:
Great question! For home goods, video can work both ways:

**YouTube** - Strong for product demonstration and room reveals. "Before/after" renovation content, styling tips, and product showcases perform well. Can drive direct response, not just awareness. Recent movers often research on YouTube for decorating ideas.

**Connected TV** - More pure brand awareness. Reaches suburban homeowners (your target) effectively, but harder to measure direct impact. Better for building familiarity so your Meta and Search ads get higher response rates.

Given your $80 CAC target and need for measurable customer acquisition, I'd lean toward **YouTube first** in that $20K test budget. It offers better attribution and can complement your Pinterest inspiration strategy.

Now let's set up measurement. With multiple channels running, how are you currently tracking which platforms are driving your best customers? Do you have attribution modeling in place, or are you mainly looking at last-click data?
