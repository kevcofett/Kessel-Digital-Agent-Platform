# Media Plan Output: Efficiency Shock

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business outcome. You mentioned needing 15,000 new policy applications - is your primary objective acquiring new policyholders, or are you optimizing for a specific revenue target from those applications?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your objective is policyholder acquisition with 15,000 applications as your primary KPI.

Let me check the efficiency math: $750K ÷ 15,000 applications = $50 per application. With your $2,800 LTV, that's a 56:1 LTV-to-CAC ratio, which is extremely strong for insurance.

However, $50 per application is quite aggressive for life insurance, where industry benchmarks typically run $80-150 per qualified application. To hit your target efficiency, we'll need very precise audience targeting and channel optimization.

What's your typical conversion rate from application to issued policy? This will help us assess if your volume target aligns with your business model.

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Perfect audience definition. That 35-60 family-focused segment with mortgages and dependents is ideal for life insurance targeting - these are people with clear protection needs and financial capacity.

A few quick signals to sharpen our targeting: Do you see stronger performance with any particular income ranges? And are there specific life events that tend to drive applications - like new babies, home purchases, or job changes - that we should prioritize in our messaging and timing?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - that 65-70% conversion rate is strong for insurance. So 15,000 applications yielding ~10,000 policies at $2,800 LTV gives you $28M in customer value.

Let me recalculate with your 55% margin: $2,800 × 55% = $1,540 contribution margin per policy. That means you can afford up to $154 per application while staying profitable ($1,540 ÷ 10 applications per policy).

Your $50 target is actually very conservative - you're targeting 67% below your breakeven point. This gives you significant flexibility. If market conditions require $75-100 per application (more typical for insurance), you'd still be highly profitable.

This strong unit economics foundation means we can focus on sustainable growth rather than efficiency constraints. Your economics are solid.

Now let's define your target audience. Who is your ideal policyholder - what age range, life stage, or key characteristics define your best customers?

Turn 5:
Excellent - that $75K-$200K household income range with new babies and home purchases gives us very targetable life events. These are high-intent moments when people actively seek protection.

Let me size this audience roughly: Adults 35-60 in that income bracket represent about 15-20% of the US adult population, or roughly 35-45 million people. The subset experiencing those key life events annually is much smaller - maybe 3-5 million - which creates a more focused but still scalable target.

This audience size should support your 15,000 application target without saturation issues.

What geographic markets are you focusing on? Are you licensed nationwide, or do you have specific states or regions where you operate?

Turn 6:
Great - nationwide licensing gives us full geographic flexibility. Your insight about suburban markets makes sense since that's where families with mortgages and growing households concentrate.

For budget allocation, we could weight toward suburban DMAs and metros with higher concentrations of your target demo - places like Atlanta suburbs, Dallas-Fort Worth, Phoenix, Charlotte - markets with strong family formation and homebuying activity.

That completes our audience and geography foundation. Now let's talk budget allocation. With your $750K total budget, how do you typically split between customer acquisition and other marketing activities? Should we plan the full $750K for new policyholder acquisition, or do you need to reserve portions for retention, brand awareness, or other initiatives?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Perfect - $750K dedicated to acquisition gives us maximum focus. With suburban market weighting toward family-concentrated areas, we can optimize for efficiency where your target demo is densest.

Now let's develop your value proposition. Given that you're targeting families during key life events like new babies and home purchases, what's your primary competitive advantage? Is it pricing, coverage options, application simplicity, speed of approval, or something else that differentiates SecureLife from competitors in those critical decision moments?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Excellent differentiator - that 24-48 hour approval versus industry standard 2-4 weeks is a massive advantage for urgent life events. "Coverage in 2 days, not 2 weeks" directly addresses the anxiety families feel when they realize they're unprotected.

The 10-minute online application perfectly matches your target demo's digital expectations and time constraints. Busy parents with new mortgages and babies need solutions that fit their hectic schedules.

This positions SecureLife as the "fast, simple protection for life's biggest moments" - emphasizing speed and ease when families need coverage most.

Now let's build your channel strategy. Given your $50 target cost per application, your family-focused audience, and your speed/simplicity value prop, what channels have you used before, and which performed best for reaching families during those key life events?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Perfect - you have some early signals that Facebook works for life event targeting, but we need to build a more strategic mix to efficiently reach 15,000 applications.

Given your $750K budget and $50 target, here's what I'd recommend:

**Paid Search (35% - $262K)**: Capture high-intent searches like "life insurance new baby" and "mortgage protection insurance." These are your hottest prospects actively seeking coverage.

**Facebook/Meta (30% - $225K)**: Leverage life event targeting (new parents, recent home buyers) plus lookalikes. Your existing success here suggests strong audience fit.

**Google Display/YouTube (20% - $150K)**: Retarget website visitors and reach families consuming parenting/home buying content.

**Native/Content (15% - $112K)**: Reach families reading articles about financial planning, parenting, home ownership - contextually relevant moments.

This mix balances intent capture with proactive targeting during life events. The 65/35 split between lower-funnel (Search) and upper-funnel aligns with your need for immediate applications while building awareness.

Does this channel allocation make sense given what you've learned about Facebook's performance?
