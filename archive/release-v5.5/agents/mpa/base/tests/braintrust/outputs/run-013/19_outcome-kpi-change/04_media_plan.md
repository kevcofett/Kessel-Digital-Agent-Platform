# Media Plan Output: Outcome KPI Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by modeling your efficiency target. $5M ÷ 25,000 policies = $200 cost per acquisition. With $2,800 LTV, that's a 14:1 LTV:CAC ratio - very strong for insurance where 8-12:1 is typical.

Your primary business outcome is clear: 25,000 new policy acquisitions. How do you define a successful policy acquisition - is it when someone completes the application, makes first payment, or stays active for a certain period?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So we're targeting 25,000 bound policies with first payment collected. With your 85% completion rate, we need approximately 29,400 qualified applications to hit your target.

Let me update the efficiency math: $5M ÷ 29,400 applications = $170 cost per qualified application. That's aggressive but achievable for insurance - typical runs $200-300 for qualified apps in your demographic.

Your $200 cost per bound policy remains excellent at 14:1 LTV ratio.

Now for economics validation: with $2,800 LTV, what's your contribution margin on a new policy? This helps us confirm whether $200 acquisition cost supports profitable growth at scale.

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent. At 60-65% margin, you're looking at $1,700-1,800 contribution per policy against $200 acquisition cost. That's 8.5-9x payback on acquisition spend - very strong economics that support aggressive growth.

Your $170 cost per application target is definitely achievable with those unit economics. Insurance campaigns in your demographic typically see $200-300 per qualified app, so you're targeting about 15-30% better efficiency than market average. With your strong LTV and margins, this is realistic.

Economics look solid. Now let's define your audience more precisely. You mentioned homeowners 35-65 with $100K+ household income during life events. Which of these life events converts best for you historically - home purchase, new baby, or pre-retirement planning?

Turn 4:
Great insight. Home purchase as your highest-converting life event gives us strong targeting precision. New baby as secondary priority makes sense for cross-sell expansion.

Let me assess audience sizing implications. Homeowners 35-65 with $100K+ income going through home purchase is a fairly narrow audience - likely 2-3M addressable nationally depending on geography. With $5M budget, we risk audience saturation within 8-12 weeks if we target too narrowly.

This suggests we'll need audience layering: primary focus on recent home buyers, secondary on new parents, with controlled expansion to broader homeowner audiences as we scale.

What geography are you targeting - national, specific regions, or metro areas where you're licensed to write policies?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Perfect. National reach with audience layering strategy addresses the saturation risk. Starting with recent home buyers, then expanding to new parents and broader homeowners gives us a clear scaling path.

With 2-3M recent home buyers nationally and your $5M budget, we can avoid saturation by geographic rotation and audience expansion timing. This supports your $170 cost per application target.

Now for budget structure: how do you want to allocate the $5M? Are you thinking equal monthly distribution over 12 months, or do you have seasonal preferences based on when home purchases peak or your business cycles?

Turn 6:
Smart seasonal approach. Let me model this out:

Peak months (Mar-Aug): 6 months × $500K = $3M
Off-peak months (Sep-Feb): 6 months × $300K = $1.8M
Total: $4.8M

That leaves $200K for contingency/optimization - perfect 4% buffer for competitive response and channel shifts.

During peak season at $500K/month, you're targeting ~2,900 applications monthly (17,400 total). Off-peak at $300K targets ~1,750 monthly (10,500 total). This pacing aligns well with home buying seasonality and gives you stronger Q2-Q3 performance.

The volume distribution also helps with audience management - higher spend during peak home buying season when your primary audience is most active.

Ready to move to value proposition development, or do you want to refine the budget allocation first?

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Perfect positioning. "Premium protection for premium properties" with personalized service differentiates you clearly from national carriers' one-size-fits-all approach.

Your value proposition framework:
- **Specialized Coverage**: Guaranteed replacement cost, higher liability, home office/rental coverage
- **Service Premium**: Dedicated claims team that understands high-value properties  
- **Target-Specific**: Built for $800K+ homes, not $150K properties
- **Justified Premium**: Worth paying more when you have significant assets at risk

This messaging will resonate strongly with your $100K+ household income audience, especially recent home buyers who just made a major investment and want specialized protection.

For recent home buyers specifically, which pain point hits hardest - inadequate coverage from their previous insurer, or anxiety about protecting their new investment?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 7:
Excellent. Now let's develop your competitive value proposition. With your strong unit economics and target efficiency, differentiation becomes crucial during peak home buying season when major carriers are also spending heavily.

For homeowners 35-65 with $100K+ income during life events, what's TrustGuard's primary competitive advantage? Is it pricing, coverage options, service experience, claims handling, or something else that sets you apart from State Farm, Allstate, and other nationals?

Turn 9:
Brilliant insight. Investment anxiety drives action more than coverage logic. Recent home buyers are emotionally vulnerable - they've just made their largest purchase and suddenly realize their protection is inadequate.

Your messaging should lead with that emotional hook: "Your biggest investment deserves specialized protection" rather than coverage feature lists. The anxiety about unknown gaps resonates perfectly with your specialized coverage strength.

For new parents (your secondary audience), is the emotional driver similar investment protection anxiety, or different - like protecting family security?
