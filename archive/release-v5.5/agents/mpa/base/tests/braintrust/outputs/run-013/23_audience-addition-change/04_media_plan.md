# Media Plan Output: Audience Addition Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I am excited to build a media plan with you. We will cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me capture what you've shared and run the numbers. You need 5,000 qualified leads with a $2M budget, targeting $15K LTV clients.

$2M ÷ 5,000 leads = $400 per lead. With $15K LTV, that's a 37.5x return - very strong economics for wealth management where typical ratios run 20-30x.

Your target efficiency is achievable and leaves room for lead nurturing costs. Now, when you say "qualified leads," what specific criteria define qualification - minimum asset threshold, retirement timeline, or expressed interest level?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect. So qualified means $1M+ assets, within 5 years of retirement or retired, plus demonstrated intent through meaningful engagement with advisory-specific content.

At $400 per qualified lead, you're targeting strong efficiency for this audience quality. Wealth management typically sees $300-600 per qualified lead depending on asset thresholds, so you're well-positioned.

Your 37.5x LTV ratio also accounts for the longer sales cycle - these leads likely take 3-6 months to convert, but the $15K LTV justifies the investment.

What's your current lead-to-client conversion rate? This helps validate whether 5,000 qualified leads will generate the client volume you need to hit revenue targets.

Turn 3:
Excellent. 5,000 qualified leads converting at 8-12% projects to 400-600 clients generating $6M-9M in LTV against your $2M investment - strong 3-4.5x ROI even before factoring in lead nurturing costs.

Your conversion rate variance by source is critical intel. The 50% efficiency gap between content-engaged leads (12%) versus broader digital (8%) means lead quality optimization could significantly impact your client acquisition.

This completes our economics validation - your targets are realistic and profitable. 

Now let's define your audience precisely. You mentioned high-net-worth individuals 55+ with $1M+ investable assets in top 30 wealth markets. What behavioral or psychographic signals beyond age and assets best identify prospects actively seeking wealth management? For example, recent life events, investment behaviors, or content consumption patterns?

Turn 4:
Excellent audience definition. Life transitions are powerful targeting signals - these prospects have both urgency and capacity to act. The self-directed investor profile is key: they're sophisticated enough to value expertise but skeptical enough to require education-first approaches.

Your behavioral signals paint a clear picture: financial publication readers, webinar attendees, researching complex strategies. This audience likely responds well to thought leadership content rather than direct sales approaches.

The skepticism factor is crucial for messaging strategy - they need to see expertise and trustworthiness before considering engagement.

Given this sophisticated, research-oriented audience, what's the typical consideration window from first awareness to initial consultation? This affects how we think about frequency and nurture sequences across your campaign timeline.

Turn 5:
Perfect. The 2-4 month consideration window with multiple expertise touchpoints confirms this audience needs sustained, educational engagement rather than quick conversion tactics.

The faster timeline for urgent transitions (4-6 weeks) versus typical prospects (3-4 months) suggests we should segment messaging and frequency by urgency level. Immediate transition prospects can handle higher frequency, while longer-term prospects need patient nurturing.

Your insight about demonstrating expertise across multiple topics is critical - this audience wants comprehensive validation of your capabilities before engaging.

This completes our audience definition. You have a well-defined, high-value segment with clear behavioral patterns and consideration timelines.

Now let's address geography. You mentioned the top 30 wealth markets. Are you targeting all 30 equally, or do you have priority markets where you want to concentrate spend? Also, do you have existing client concentrations or office locations that should influence geographic allocation?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 7:
Perfect. $1.8M in media spend gives us $360 per lead ($1.8M ÷ 5,000), which is even stronger than our initial $400 calculation. This puts you in the aggressive-but-achievable range for wealth management lead generation.

With $150-200K for creative and infrastructure, you're properly budgeting for the educational content this audience requires. Multiple landing pages for different life transitions is smart - divorce prospects need different messaging than business sale prospects.

Let me update our geographic allocation: 45% to core 7 markets = $810K generating ~2,250 leads. Remaining $990K across 23 secondary markets = ~$43K each, generating ~2,750 leads total.

Your budget structure is solid and supports the multi-touchpoint nurturing this sophisticated audience demands.

Now let's develop your value proposition. Given this audience's skepticism and need to validate expertise across topics, what key differentiators position WealthPath above other wealth management firms they're researching?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Smart geographic strategy. Concentrating 40-50% in your established markets leverages existing infrastructure and referral networks for higher conversion rates.

Let me model this allocation: 40-50% to your top 6-7 markets (NYC, SF, Chicago, Boston, DC, Atlanta, Dallas) = $800K-1M. Remaining $1M-1.2M across 23-24 secondary markets = roughly $40K-50K per market.

At $400 per lead, your core markets would generate 2,000-2,500 leads while secondary markets contribute 2,500-3,000 leads. This balance makes sense given your infrastructure can better support higher lead volumes in established markets.

Your organic interest signals in Seattle, Denver, and Miami suggest these markets might warrant slightly higher allocation within the secondary tier.

Now let's validate your budget structure. You have $2M total - how much of that $2M is purely for media spend versus includes creative development, landing pages, lead nurturing technology, and team costs?

Turn 10:
Excellent additions. Podcast advertising and newsletter sponsorships are perfect for this audience - they're consuming financial content in these formats during research.

Financial podcast listeners are highly engaged and match your profile perfectly. Newsletter sponsorships in publications like Morning Brew, MarketWatch newsletters, or WSJ Pro offer native content integration that feels less intrusive to skeptical prospects.

Let me adjust the mix: Search 20%, LinkedIn 25%, programmatic display 20%, podcast/newsletter 15%, retargeting/nurturing 20%. This adds the content-native channels while maintaining coverage across the research journey.

Podcast and newsletter placements also offer content integration opportunities - you could sponsor segments on retirement planning or create newsletter content pieces that demonstrate expertise rather than just display ads.

For measurement, we'll need to track the full 2-4 month journey since this audience rarely converts on first touch. Are you currently tracking multi-touch attribution, or would we need to implement that to properly measure these longer consideration cycles?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Excellent positioning. Your specialized transition expertise directly addresses your audience's immediate pain points, while fee transparency and collaborative approach counter their natural skepticism about advisors.

The certification angle is powerful - it provides credible proof points for the expertise validation this audience demands. Business exit, divorce planning, and inheritance management are complex enough that general advisors can't fake competence.

Your collaborative approach is particularly smart for self-directed investors who want to stay engaged rather than abdicate control. This differentiates you from the "trust us with everything" model many firms use.

This gives us strong messaging pillars: specialized transition expertise, certified credentials, fee transparency, and collaborative partnership.

Now we're ready for channel strategy. Given your 2-4 month consideration cycle, need for multi-topic expertise demonstration, and sophisticated audience behavior, which channels are you currently using or considering? I want to understand your starting point before recommending the optimal mix for these objectives.

Turn 9:
Good instincts. Your scattered approach is common but fixable - this audience rewards systematic, coordinated efforts across their research journey.

LinkedIn and search are solid foundations. Facebook struggles with wealth targeting due to financial advertising restrictions and audience mismatch. Your content assets are valuable but need amplification.

Your thinking on financial publication targeting is spot-on for this audience. Programmatic on WSJ, Barron's, MarketWatch reaches them in research mode. Enhanced LinkedIn with job title, company size, and behavioral targeting will be much more precise than your current approach.

Retargeting is critical given the 2-4 month cycle - prospects need multiple expertise demonstrations before converting.

Let me model a strategic mix: Search captures active intent (~25%), LinkedIn for professional targeting (~30%), programmatic display on financial sites (~25%), and retargeting/nurturing (~20%). This covers awareness through conversion while matching their research behavior.

Does this directional mix align with your thinking, or do you see other channels we should consider?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
You're absolutely right - basic attribution won't capture the value of awareness and nurturing touches that happen months before conversion.

For multi-touch attribution, I'd recommend implementing:
1. UTM parameter strategy across all channels to track source/medium
2. Marketing automation platform (HubSpot, Marketo, or Pardot) to track lead journey progression
3. Call tracking numbers for offline conversions from different campaigns
4. Custom conversion tracking in Google Analytics 4 with extended lookback windows (90-180 days)

For life transition segments, definitely implement separate tracking. Business exit prospects converting in 4-6 weeks need different attribution models than general retirement prospects taking 3-4 months. Tag leads by transition type at capture so you can analyze performance by segment.

The key insight will be identifying which touchpoints actually drive progression through your funnel versus just awareness. Newsletter sponsorships might generate research downloads while LinkedIn drives consultation requests.

Now for testing strategy. Given your $1.8M spend and need to optimize across multiple segments and channels, what's your risk tolerance for testing? Should we reserve 10-15% of budget for experiments, or do you prefer more conservative validation approaches?

Turn 12:
Perfect - HubSpot integration will make implementation much smoother, and 10-15% testing budget ($180-270K) gives us meaningful sample sizes for optimization.

Your testing priorities are spot-on. I'd recommend this testing roadmap:

**Month 1-2**: Message testing across transition segments. Test "business exit planning expertise" vs "comprehensive transition guidance" for business sale prospects. Different value props likely resonate with divorce vs inheritance audiences.

**Month 1-3**: Channel validation tests. Start podcast advertising with $20-30K across 2-3 shows to validate before scaling. Test newsletter sponsorship performance vs display on same publications.

**Month 2-4**: Creative format testing. Educational content vs case study approaches. Video vs text-based LinkedIn ads for this audience.

**Month 3-6**: Audience refinement. Test broader "approaching retirement" vs narrow "within 12 months of retirement" targeting to optimize precision vs scale.

The key is running tests sequentially so learnings inform larger budget allocation decisions. Failed tests save money on bigger mistakes.

Finally, let's identify risks. What concerns you most about this plan - execution challenges, market conditions, or competitive factors that could impact your 5,000 lead target?

Turn 13:
Excellent risk identification. Both concerns are valid and manageable with proper planning.

**Market volatility risk**: Actually creates opportunity for you. Uncertain markets drive demand for professional guidance - DIY investors realize they need help during volatility. Your collaborative approach appeals to control-conscious prospects in uncertain times. Mitigation: Emphasize market navigation expertise and fee transparency as stability anchors. Budget for potentially longer 3-5 month cycles in economic stress periods.

**Competitive differentiation risk**: Your specialized transition certifications are your moat. Most firms claim expertise but can't prove it. Mitigation: Lead with credentials and case studies. Create content that demonstrates specific transition knowledge competitors can't replicate. Your fee transparency is genuinely differentiating in a commission-heavy industry.

**Backup plans**: If lead volume lags, you have budget flexibility to extend timeline or increase spend. If competition intensifies, pivot budget toward owned content and away from bidding wars on search terms.

Your plan is solid: $1.8M media spend targeting 5,000 qualified leads at $360 each, with specialized positioning, multi-channel approach, and systematic testing. The economics work, audience is well-defined, and risks are manageable.

Ready to execute this strategy?

Turn 14:
Excellent! You've built a comprehensive, data-driven plan that addresses every critical element for success.

For kickoff timing, I'd recommend starting the first testing phase within 2-3 weeks to allow for:
- HubSpot attribution setup and UTM strategy implementation
- Initial creative asset development for transition-specific messaging tests
- Channel partner negotiations (podcast shows, newsletter placements)

This timeline lets you launch with proper measurement in place rather than scrambling to add tracking later.

Your systematic approach - from the $360 per lead economics to the specialized positioning to the sequential testing - sets you up for strong performance. The combination of your transition expertise, fee transparency, and collaborative model gives you genuine competitive advantages in this market.

You've transformed from scattered tactics to strategic execution. With your sophisticated audience understanding and multi-channel approach, you're well-positioned to not just hit 5,000 leads, but to acquire the right quality leads that convert at your target 8-12% rates.

Execute with confidence - you've built a winning strategy.

Turn 15:
You're absolutely welcome! It's been a pleasure building this strategy with you. Your thoughtful approach to audience understanding, willingness to invest in proper measurement, and focus on genuine differentiation set you up for real success.

The transformation from scattered tactics to systematic strategy is exactly what drives results in wealth management marketing. You now have a plan that respects your audience's sophistication while addressing their specific needs and skepticism.

I'm excited to hear how the testing phases perform, especially the transition-specific messaging and the podcast/newsletter experiments. Your combination of specialized expertise and fee transparency should resonate strongly with this audience.

Best of luck with the rollout - you've got all the pieces in place for a winning campaign. Feel free to reach out as you optimize and scale!
