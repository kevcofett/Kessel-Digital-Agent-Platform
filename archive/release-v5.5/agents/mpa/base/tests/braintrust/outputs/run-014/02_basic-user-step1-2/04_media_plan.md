# Media Plan Output: Basic User - Steps 1-2 Completion

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What business outcome are you trying to achieve? Are you looking to get more customers, increase sales from existing customers, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect! So you want to grow your customer base and overall sales volume. 

To measure success, what number would tell you this campaign worked? For example, would you track total customers acquired, total revenue generated, or something else?

Turn 4:
Let me update our projections. $250,000 ÷ 5,000 customers = $50 per customer. 

That's quite aggressive - shoe retailers typically spend $60-100 per customer. You're targeting efficiency that's 17-50% better than market average. This is ambitious but possible with tight targeting and the right channel mix.

Do you know roughly what profit you make on each shoe sale? This helps us confirm whether $50 per customer makes sense for your business.

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 5:
Got it. For shoe retailers, profit margins typically run 40-50%. Let me model using 45% margin on your $100-150 average order value. That suggests roughly $45-68 profit per customer. You can adjust anytime.

At $50 cost per customer against $45-68 profit, your efficiency target is tight but workable. To hit 5,000 customers at $50 each, we'll need precise audience targeting and efficient channels.

Now let's define who you're trying to reach. What does your ideal shoe customer look like?

Turn 6:
Perfect! Young urban professionals, 25-40, who value style-comfort combination for work and city life. That's a strong foundation.

A couple of key details to sharpen our targeting: Are you focusing more on men, women, or both? And when you say "cities," are you thinking major metros like NYC, LA, Chicago, or also including smaller urban areas?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent! So 5,000 new customers generating $500K-$750K in revenue. That means each customer is worth about $100-150 on average, which is solid for online shoes.

What budget are you working with to acquire these 5,000 customers?
