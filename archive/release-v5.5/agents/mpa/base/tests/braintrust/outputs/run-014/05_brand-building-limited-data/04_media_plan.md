# Media Plan Output: Brand Building with Limited Data

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

For your West Coast brand awareness launch, I need to understand your success definition. Brand awareness can mean many things - are you measuring success by the number of new customers you acquire, total revenue generated, or something else like brand recognition surveys?

Turn 2:
Perfect! So your objective is acquiring new customers in the West Coast market, and you'll measure success by total new customer count. 

With your $500K budget, what's your target for new customers? Are you aiming for a specific number of first-time buyers across California, Oregon, and Washington?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Got it. For wellness supplement brands, customer lifetime value typically runs $300-600 based on industry data with good repeat purchase rates. Let me model at $450 - you can adjust anytime.

At $450 customer value vs $200 acquisition cost, that's a 2.25x return, which is solid for brand building in a new market. This suggests your 2,500 customer target is achievable if we execute well.

However, since you're entering completely new markets, we might want to be more conservative on efficiency expectations. Would you prefer to target 2,000 customers at $250 each (still aggressive but more buffer), or stick with 2,500 and plan for very precise targeting?

Turn 5:
Perfect! 2,000 customers at $250 each with your $500K budget. That's still above typical $80-150 for wellness supplements, but gives you learning room in new markets.

Now let's define your target customer. Who specifically are you trying to reach with your natural supplements and wellness products? Think about demographics, lifestyle, or behaviors that make someone likely to buy from GreenLeaf Wellness.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Let me model this for you. At 2,500 customers (midpoint of your range), that's $500K ÷ 2,500 = $200 per customer to acquire.

For natural supplements and wellness products, typical customer acquisition costs run $80-150 based on industry benchmarks. At $200, you're targeting about 33-150% above typical - this is aggressive and will require very efficient targeting and strong messaging.

A few paths forward: we could aim for 3,500-6,250 customers at market-typical efficiency, or stick with 2,500 but plan for premium targeting to justify the higher cost per customer.

Do you have a sense of what a customer is typically worth to your business over time?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Great profile! Health-conscious millennials and Gen Z, ages 25-40, urban professionals who prioritize natural wellness and fitness. That's a strong foundation.

To size this audience properly, I need to understand how broad or narrow to go. Are you looking for people who are already supplement buyers, or would you include anyone interested in natural health and fitness who might be new to supplements? This affects whether we're targeting 5% or 20% of the population in these markets.

Turn 7:
Perfect! Targeting the broader health and wellness interested audience at about 20% of the population makes sense for brand building.

Now let's get specific about geography. You mentioned California, Oregon, and Washington - are you planning to cover all major markets in these states, or do you want to focus on specific cities or regions? For example, are you thinking major metros like LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, or broader statewide coverage?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Excellent! Focusing on LA, San Francisco, San Diego, Seattle, Portland, and Sacramento makes sense for efficiency and demographic concentration.

Now for budget allocation across these metros. You could distribute evenly, or weight by market size and opportunity. LA metro alone has about 13 million people versus Portland at 2.5 million.

Do you want to allocate budget proportionally by market size, or do you have strategic reasons to weight certain markets differently - like testing smaller markets first or prioritizing specific regions?

Turn 9:
Perfect! So we have:
- 50% to California metros ($250K)
- 30% to Seattle ($150K) 
- 20% to Portland ($100K)

This gives us strong California focus while testing the other markets.

Now let's develop your value proposition. What makes GreenLeaf Wellness different from other supplement brands? When someone discovers your brand for the first time, what key message or benefit should make them choose you over competitors?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Excellent positioning! "Pure, science-backed natural supplements for everyday performance" with transparency and quality as key differentiators. That resonates well with health-conscious urban professionals.

Now let's build your channel strategy. With brand awareness goals, $250 customer acquisition target, and urban professional audiences across major West Coast metros, we need channels that build both awareness and drive conversions.

For wellness supplements targeting millennials/Gen Z, I'd recommend a digital-first approach: Meta (Facebook/Instagram) for broad awareness and interest targeting, Google for search intent, and potentially Connected TV for premium brand building in these affluent metros.

What's your experience level with digital advertising channels?

Turn 11:
Got it! I'll recommend channels that match your experience level while maximizing impact.

For your $500K budget and brand awareness goals, here's what I'd suggest:

**Meta (Facebook/Instagram) - 60% ($300K)**: Best for reaching health-conscious millennials/Gen Z with interest targeting and visual wellness content. Strong for both awareness and conversions.

**Google Ads - 25% ($125K)**: Captures search intent when people look for "natural supplements" or wellness terms. More direct conversion focus.

**Connected TV - 15% ($75K)**: Premium brand building in affluent urban markets. Reaches cord-cutters in your demographic.

This gives you broad awareness (Meta + CTV) plus intent capture (Google). All three platforms offer good learning opportunities without requiring deep expertise upfront.

Does this channel mix align with your comfort level and goals?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 12:
Perfect! That channel mix gives you strong coverage across the awareness-to-conversion funnel.

Now let's set up measurement. For each channel, we need to track what matters most:

**Primary KPI**: New customer count (your 2,000 target)
**Secondary metrics**: Cost per customer by channel, brand search volume increase, and website traffic from each metro

**Meta**: Track new customer conversions, not just clicks or engagement
**Google**: Monitor both brand and non-brand search performance  
**Connected TV**: Use brand lift surveys and monitor increases in direct traffic

We'll also want to track overall brand awareness in your target metros through quarterly surveys.

Does this measurement approach give you the insights you need to optimize and prove success?
