# Media Plan Output: Mass National Campaign - Simplicity Test

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I am excited to build a media plan with you. We will cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

For your national snack launch, I need to understand the specific business outcome you're targeting. Brand awareness is the strategy, but what business result are you trying to achieve? For example, are you aiming to drive trial purchases, increase market share by a certain percentage, or establish baseline brand recognition before a major retail push?

Turn 2:
Perfect! So your business outcome is establishing national brand recognition to secure retail placement and capture 3-4% market share in year one.

Now I need to understand how you'll measure success as a number. You mentioned brand lift studies - what specific metric will indicate you've achieved that baseline recognition? For example, are you targeting a certain percentage of aided brand awareness, unaided recall, or purchase intent among your target audience?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - 20% aided brand awareness in six months and 15% purchase intent by year-end. Those are strong, measurable targets that retailers will respect.

Now let's check if your plan is realistic. With an $8M budget targeting adults 18-54 nationally (roughly 130 million people), you're working with about $0.06 per person for the full campaign. 

To hit 20% aided awareness typically requires 3-5 exposures per person. Industry benchmarks suggest $0.15-$0.25 per person for that level of awareness building in CPG. At $0.06 per person, you're targeting about 4x more efficiency than typical.

This is quite aggressive. To make $8M work for 20% national awareness, we'll need very precise audience targeting rather than the broad 18-54 approach. Would you be open to narrowing your audience to heavy snack purchasers or specific demographics to improve efficiency?

Turn 4:
Got it - maintaining national scope is critical for your retail strategy. Let me model a path forward.

At $8M for national reach, we can make this work by optimizing within the broad 18-54 range rather than shrinking it. Based on snack category data, focusing on households with kids, higher snack purchase frequency, and key DMAs can improve efficiency by 30-40% while maintaining broad appeal.

This approach targets roughly 80 million adults (versus 130 million total) at about $0.10 per person - still aggressive but more achievable. We'd prioritize markets representing 70% of snack sales volume first, then expand.

The key will be channel selection in Step 7 - mixing efficient digital video with selective traditional media rather than trying to be everywhere at once.

Does this balance of broad appeal with smarter targeting within your 18-54 audience feel right for establishing that retail-critical national presence?

Turn 5:
Perfect! You've got a solid foundation - 20% aided awareness nationally with smart targeting within 18-54, prioritizing high-value segments at $0.10 per person.

Now let's define your audience more precisely. You mentioned households with kids and higher snack purchase frequency. For the households with kids segment, are you thinking families with children of specific ages? Snack consumption patterns vary significantly - families with elementary school kids (5-12) typically drive different purchase behavior than those with teens (13-17).

What age range of children would be most relevant for your new snack line?

Turn 6:
Excellent! Families with kids 6-12 are prime snack influencers and drive significant household purchase volume.

Now for the "higher snack purchase frequency" segment - this could include single adults and couples who are heavy snack consumers. Are you thinking of targeting based on purchase behavior like frequent convenience store shoppers, bulk snack buyers, or people who show high engagement with snack brands online? 

What specific behaviors or characteristics would identify your high-frequency snack consumers outside of the families-with-kids segment?

Turn 7:
Perfect! So we have two core audience segments:

1. **Families with kids 6-12** - Elementary/middle school families driving household snack decisions
2. **On-the-go professionals** - Millennials and younger Gen X who shop premium grocers and value convenient, quality snacks

These segments complement each other well - different purchase occasions but both align with your brand positioning.

For geography, you mentioned targeting key markets first representing 70% of snack sales volume, then expanding. Are you thinking of prioritizing by metro market size, or do you have specific regions where snack consumption over-indexes? For example, some CPG brands see stronger performance in certain regions due to taste preferences or retail partnerships.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 9:
Smart allocation - $4.8M toward families for sustained volume and $3.2M for professionals to drive trial and buzz. That 60/40 split reflects the purchasing power dynamics well.

Now let's think about your value proposition for each segment. For families with kids 6-12, what key benefits will resonate most? Are you positioning around health/nutrition, convenience for busy parents, kid appeal and taste, or something else? 

The messaging that works for elementary school families often differs from what drives professional trial, so I want to understand your family-focused value prop first.

Turn 10:
Perfect positioning - "smart treats" that solve the parent dilemma of nutrition without taste compromise. That protein-packed, lower sugar, premium-but-fun angle is compelling.

For the on-the-go professionals segment, how are you positioning the snack? Are you emphasizing the same nutrition benefits but framing them differently, or taking a completely different approach like energy/performance, gourmet flavors, or convenient meal replacement? 

What value proposition will drive trial among busy millennials and Gen X professionals?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Excellent targeting! Those tier-1 metros with strong grocery retail and high category spending give you the best foundation for national expansion.

With your two audience segments defined and key metro focus, let's move to budget allocation. You have $8M total. How are you thinking about splitting this between your two core audiences - families with kids 6-12 versus on-the-go millennials/Gen X professionals? 

Some brands weight toward families since they drive higher household volume, while others prioritize professionals for faster trial adoption. What feels right for your launch strategy?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 11:
Excellent! Two distinct but cohesive value propositions:
- **Families**: "Smart treats" - balanced nutrition kids love
- **Professionals**: "Fuel for performance" - sophisticated, energy-supporting snacks

This sets us up perfectly for channel strategy. With $4.8M for families and $3.2M for professionals across your key metros, we need channels that efficiently reach each segment while building that 20% aided awareness.

For the family segment, what channels do you think would be most effective? Are you thinking traditional family-focused media like streaming TV and social, or more targeted approaches like school-adjacent advertising and parenting-focused digital platforms?

Turn 13:
Perfect targeting! LinkedIn, Spotify, and premium business/wellness sites align beautifully with your "fuel for performance" positioning.

Let me model your professional allocation: $3.2M across LinkedIn, Spotify, and premium display:
- **LinkedIn**: $1.3M (40%) - Video-first targeting professionals with productivity content
- **Spotify**: $1.1M (35%) - Business/wellness podcast sponsorships and audio ads
- **Premium Display**: $800K (25%) - Business Insider, Fast Company, health/fitness platforms

Combined with your family channels, this gives you a strong video-heavy approach across both segments while maintaining your $8M budget.

Now for measurement - you mentioned brand lift studies for 20% aided awareness. How frequently will you field these studies, and are you planning to track both segments separately or measure overall brand performance? Also, will you track any interim metrics like video completion rates or engagement before the formal brand studies?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 12:
Smart channel thinking! Connected TV, YouTube, and Meta platforms will efficiently reach families with precise targeting and strong creative storytelling for your "smart treat" message.

Let me model the family allocation: $4.8M across CTV, YouTube, and Meta. Based on your key metros, you're looking at roughly:
- **Connected TV**: $2.2M (45%) - Premium family programming with household targeting
- **YouTube**: $1.4M (30%) - Parenting content and family channels  
- **Meta (Instagram/Facebook)**: $1.2M (25%) - Parenting communities and lifestyle targeting

This gives you video-first storytelling capability with precise audience reach.

For the professional segment with $3.2M, what channels feel right for reaching busy millennials/Gen X with that "fuel for performance" message? Are you thinking workplace-adjacent digital, premium content platforms, or different social channels?

Turn 15:
Perfect testing strategy! Creative messaging validation early will strengthen both your media performance and retail positioning.

Finally, let's identify potential risks. With an $8M national launch targeting 20% aided awareness in six months, what concerns you most? For example, are you worried about competitive response from established snack brands, creative fatigue across your video-heavy approach, or the challenge of measuring incremental awareness versus baseline brand recognition?

What keeps you up at night about this launch?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 14:
Excellent measurement approach! Quarterly brand lift studies by segment with real-time optimization metrics gives you both strategic validation and tactical agility.

For testing, what elements are you most interested in learning about during the campaign? For example, are you planning to test different creative messages between segments, compare channel performance within each audience, or test geographic rollout strategies across your key metros?

Given your national launch timeline and retail goals, what would be most valuable to validate early?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 16:
That's a very real risk - breaking through in a category dominated by billion-dollar brands requires surgical precision.
