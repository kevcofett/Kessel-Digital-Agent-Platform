# Media Plan Output: Budget Revision Midstream

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business outcome. You mentioned targeting 10,000 new customers - is customer acquisition your primary objective, or are you also focused on other outcomes like pipeline generation or brand awareness in the analytics space?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your primary objective is customer acquisition with a focus on quality - MQLs that convert to SQLs with strong revenue potential. 

For measuring success, what's your primary KPI? Are you tracking cost per MQL, cost per SQL, cost per customer acquired, or something else? I want to make sure we optimize for the metric that matters most to your business.

Turn 3:
Excellent - cost per customer acquired under $50 is your primary KPI. Let me run the math on your targets:

$500K budget ÷ 10,000 customers = $50 CAC target

With $2,400 LTV, that gives you a 48:1 LTV:CAC ratio - extremely healthy for B2B SaaS where 3:1 is considered good and 5:1+ is excellent.

However, $50 CAC is very aggressive for B2B analytics SaaS. Industry benchmarks typically show $200-600 CAC for mid-market SaaS, depending on deal size and sales cycle. At your target efficiency, you'd need to be 4-8x more efficient than market typical.

This is ambitious but not impossible with tight targeting and channel optimization. To hit $50 CAC, we'll need precise audience definition and highly efficient channels.

Does this efficiency target reflect internal pressure, or do you have data suggesting $50 CAC is achievable in your market?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 5:
Perfect - that clarity helps tremendously. Growth targets are non-negotiable, so we'll build toward 10,000 customers with budget flexibility.

Let me model realistic scenarios:

**Scenario 1:** 10,000 customers at $200 CAC = $2M budget (4x current)
**Scenario 2:** 10,000 customers at $150 CAC = $1.5M budget (3x current) - requires excellent execution

The $150 CAC scenario is ambitious but achievable with tight audience targeting and channel optimization. It's still 3x better than high-end benchmarks.

Since you mentioned implementing better tracking, that's crucial. Without knowing your current CAC, we're flying blind on what efficiency gains are realistic.

Now let's move to audience strategy. You mentioned targeting mid-market companies for analytics. What size companies specifically - employee count, revenue range, or other criteria that define your ideal customer?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Got it - this helps clarify the situation. Your CFO's target is understandable from a unit economics perspective, but we need to ground it in market reality.

Let me model both scenarios so we can present options:

**Conservative scenario:** At $300 CAC (mid-range for your space), $500K would yield ~1,667 customers - well short of your 10,000 target.

**Aggressive scenario:** To hit 10,000 customers at realistic efficiency, you'd need roughly $3M budget.

**Hybrid approach:** We could target 2,500 high-quality customers at $200 CAC within your $500K budget.

Before we dive into audience targeting that could drive efficiency, what's more flexible - the customer count target or the budget? And do you have any current campaign data showing your actual cost per customer that we could use as a baseline?

Turn 7:
Perfect - 300-600 employees is our sweet spot, and Analytics Managers/Directors of Operations are our primary targets with VPs as secondary influencers.

Now for geography. Are you planning a national rollup, or do you want to focus on specific markets? Tech hubs like SF Bay Area, Seattle, Austin often have higher concentrations of your target companies, but also higher competition and costs.

What's your geographic strategy - go broad nationally or concentrate in key metros where your ideal customers cluster?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent targeting framework. Mid-market companies with 100-1000 employees in tech, finance, and e-commerce who've outgrown spreadsheets but aren't enterprise-scale yet.

Your primary buyer persona being ops/analytics teams is crucial - these are sophisticated, data-driven decision makers who'll scrutinize ROI carefully.

A few refinement questions to sharpen our targeting:

Within that 100-1000 employee range, do you see better conversion rates from smaller companies (100-300) who are scaling fast, or larger ones (500-1000) who have more budget but longer sales cycles?

And for the ops/analytics team persona - are we typically talking to Analytics Managers, Directors of Operations, or VP-level decision makers?

Turn 8:
Smart thinking. Concentrated metro targeting typically drives 20-30% better efficiency than broad national approaches for B2B SaaS.

Based on your current customer concentration, I'd recommend a tiered approach:

**Tier 1 metros:** SF Bay Area, Seattle, Austin, Denver, Boston
**Tier 2:** Expansion markets with similar profiles

This concentration strategy should help us get closer to that aggressive $150 CAC target by reducing waste and improving relevance.

Now let's talk budget allocation. With the $1.5M budget we modeled for 10,000 customers at $150 CAC, how do you want to think about allocation? 

Are you open to front-loading spend in Q1-Q2 to generate learning data faster, or do you prefer steady pacing across the year? And what percentage should we reserve for testing new channels and optimizations?

Turn 9:
Excellent approach. Front-loading 60% for early momentum and reserving 15-20% for testing gives us the agility needed for your complex B2B sales cycle.

So we're looking at:
- Q1-Q2: ~$900K (60% of $1.5M)
- Testing reserve: ~$225-300K (15-20%)
- Remaining: Steady pacing Q3-Q4

Now let's define your value proposition for messaging. You mentioned companies outgrowing spreadsheets but not ready for enterprise solutions. What's your core differentiator - is it ease of implementation, specific analytics capabilities, pricing, or something else that resonates most with those Analytics Managers and Directors of Operations?

Turn 10:
Perfect - "speed to insight with minimal setup complexity" is a compelling value prop for time-constrained ops teams. Integration in days versus months is a powerful differentiator in a market full of complex enterprise solutions.

Now let's build your channel strategy. Given your concentrated metro targeting, sophisticated B2B audience, and need for efficient $150 CAC, I'm thinking a mix of LinkedIn for precise professional targeting, Google for high-intent search, and potentially programmatic display for retargeting.

LinkedIn will be premium but precise for reaching Analytics Managers in your target companies. Google captures active demand. Programmatic helps with nurturing and frequency.

What channels have you used before, and are there any you definitely want to include or avoid?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Great foundation to build on. Your channel instincts are solid - LinkedIn for precision despite high CPCs, Google for intent capture, and programmatic for cost-effective retargeting.

Let me model a strategic mix for your $1.5M budget:

**LinkedIn (30% - $450K):** Premium but precise targeting of Analytics Managers in 300-600 employee companies
**Google Search (35% - $525K):** Capture high-intent searches for analytics solutions
**Programmatic Display/Retargeting (25% - $375K):** Cost-effective reach and nurturing
**Podcast Testing (10% - $150K):** Pilot with attribution tracking

This gives LinkedIn enough budget to optimize while balancing with more efficient channels. Programmatic should help lower your blended CAC significantly.

For measurement, we'll need robust attribution tracking across all channels. Are you currently using any marketing attribution platform, or would we need to implement tracking infrastructure as part of this plan?

Turn 13:
Excellent testing framework - 70/30 split between optimization and exploration is smart for a growth-focused plan.

Your audience testing ideas are sharp. Segmenting by tech stack (companies using Salesforce, Snowflake, etc.) or funding stage (Series A/B companies scaling fast) could unlock significant efficiency gains.

For risk management, let's identify the key failure modes:

**Primary risks:**
- Attribution lag masking poor early performance 
- LinkedIn CPCs escalating beyond budget capacity
- Sales team conversion rates dropping below 20% with volume increase
- Economic downturn affecting mid-market B2B spending

**Mitigation strategies:**
- Weekly performance reviews with leading indicators
- CPC caps and bid management protocols
- Sales enablement support for increased lead volume
- Conservative pacing with ability to pause/pivot

What concerns you most about executing this plan? Is it the aggressive efficiency targets, scaling the sales process, or something else that keeps you up at night?

Turn 15:
Perfect - that's the right mindset. Committing to 10,000 customers with strategic sales investment shows you understand the full growth equation.

**Final plan summary:**
- **Target:** 10,000 customers at $150 CAC
- **Marketing budget:** $1.5M (phased: 60% Q1-Q2, testing reserve 15-20%)
- **Sales investment:** $250-300K for capacity scaling
- **Channel mix:** LinkedIn 30%, Google 35%, Programmatic 25%, Podcast testing 10%
- **Geography:** Concentrated metro strategy (SF, Seattle, Austin, Denver, Boston)
- **Measurement:** Upgraded attribution platform + incrementality testing
- **Risk mitigation:** Phased ramp with conversion rate monitoring

This gives you a defensible path to aggressive growth targets while building the infrastructure to sustain that scale.

You've built a comprehensive media plan that balances ambitious targets with operational reality. Ready to present this framework to your CFO and board?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 12:
HubSpot's basic tracking won't cut it for your complex sales cycle and multi-channel approach. For B2B SaaS with 6-12 month sales cycles, you'll need robust multi-touch attribution.

I'd recommend evaluating platforms like Bizible (now Adobe Marketo Measure) or HockeyStack for B2B attribution, or Northbeam for cross-channel tracking. Budget $25-50K annually for enterprise attribution tools.

Key measurement framework:
- **Primary KPI:** Cost per customer acquired (targeting $150)
- **Leading indicators:** MQL cost, SQL conversion rates, pipeline velocity
- **Attribution:** Multi-touch with incrementality testing on major channels

Given attribution complexity, I strongly recommend starting with incrementality tests on LinkedIn and Google in Q1 to validate true performance versus attributed performance.

Now for testing strategy. With 15-20% budget reserved for optimization, what's your appetite for testing new audience segments, creative approaches, or entirely new channels? Should we focus tests on optimizing current channels or exploring expansion opportunities?

Turn 14:
That's exactly the right concern - sales capacity is often the hidden constraint in aggressive growth plans. Your 20% SQL conversion rate at current volume doesn't guarantee the same rate at 5-10x volume.

**Critical success factors for sales scaling:**
- Lead scoring refinement to prioritize highest-intent prospects
- Sales enablement materials for faster qualification
- Potential sales headcount planning (SDRs and AEs)
- Process automation to handle volume without quality loss

**Plan modifications to consider:**
- Phased ramp: Target 3,000 customers Q1-Q2, assess conversion rates, then scale
- Higher lead quality thresholds initially to protect conversion rates
- Sales feedback loops built into campaign optimization

Given this constraint, would you prefer to model a more conservative 6,000-7,000 customer target that better matches realistic sales capacity, or stick with 10,000 but plan for significant sales investment alongside the marketing budget?
