# Media Plan Output: Demographic Shift Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business outcome. You mentioned 100K new customers - is customer acquisition your primary objective, or are you also focused on brand awareness or existing customer retention alongside new acquisition?

Turn 2:
Perfect. Customer acquisition is your primary objective with 100K new customers as the target. Let me run the economics quickly:

$1.5M budget ÷ 100K customers = $15 cost per customer

With $350 LTV, that's a 23:1 return ratio - extremely efficient compared to streetwear benchmarks of typically $25-45 per customer. This suggests either very strong organic amplification potential or we may need to adjust expectations.

Is your $15 implied cost per customer based on proven performance, or should we model a more conservative efficiency target?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Smart approach. Let me remodel at $25-30 cost per customer:

At $25: $1.5M ÷ $25 = 60K customers (40% below your 100K target)
At $30: $1.5M ÷ $30 = 50K customers (50% below your 100K target)

Both scenarios show a gap. To hit 100K customers, you'd need either:
- $2.5M budget at $25 efficiency, or 
- $3M budget at $30 efficiency

Given streetwear typically runs $25-45 per customer, your $25-30 target is achievable but requires tight execution.

Would you prefer to adjust the customer target to match your $1.5M budget, or explore increasing budget to hit 100K customers?

Turn 4:
Excellent strategic thinking. Let's model 65K customers (middle of your 60-70K range):

$1.5M ÷ 65K = $23 cost per customer

At $23 with $350 LTV, you're targeting a 15:1 return - strong efficiency that's achievable for streetwear. This gives you room to optimize toward your 100K goal through performance improvements rather than budget increases.

Your economics look solid. Now let's define your audience more precisely. You mentioned Millennials 25-40 into streetwear and urban fashion. 

What specific behaviors or interests best identify your highest-value customers - are they following certain influencers, shopping specific brands, or engaging with particular content types?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Perfect - that's a highly targetable psychographic profile. Your audience shows strong cultural engagement signals around streetwear authenticity and exclusivity.

For geography, you mentioned top 25 DMAs and called out NYC, LA, and Chicago specifically. 

Should we prioritize those three metros as your tier-1 markets and then add 22 more DMAs, or do you want equal focus across all 25 markets? Understanding your geographic priorities will help us allocate your $1.5M budget most effectively.

Turn 7:
Perfect. At 15% creative ($225K), that leaves $1.275M for media spend - which gets us to exactly $23 cost per customer for 55,435 customers, right in your target range.

Your influencer-partnership approach for creative is smart - authentic content from scene insiders will drive better performance than traditional advertising.

Now let's define your value proposition. For culture-conscious streetwear buyers who follow Supreme and Off-White, what makes UrbanStyle Collective worth choosing over established brands or other emerging labels? What's your unique positioning in the streetwear landscape?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Smart allocation strategy. Let me model your geographic budget split:

Tier 1 (NYC, LA, Chicago): 45% = $675K
Tier 2 (remaining 22 DMAs): 55% = $825K

At $23 target efficiency:
- Tier 1: 29,350 customers from core markets
- Tier 2: 35,870 customers from secondary markets
- Total: 65,220 customers

This concentration in cultural hubs should create amplification effects - streetwear trends from NYC/LA/Chicago often influence secondary markets organically.

Now for budget allocation within your $1.5M. Beyond the 80-85% for media spend, how much are you planning for creative production? Streetwear demands fresh, authentic creative that resonates with culture-conscious audiences.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Strong positioning - "authentic conversation with culture" differentiates you from both heritage giants and trend-chasers. The storytelling through limited drops creates scarcity and cultural relevance.

Your value proposition should resonate well with audiences seeking authenticity over hype. Now we can build your channel strategy.

Given your audience lives on Instagram and TikTok, follows streetwear influencers, and values cultural authenticity, which channels are you currently considering? And are there any platforms you definitely want to avoid or prioritize?

Turn 9:
Excellent channel instincts - Instagram and TikTok align perfectly with your audience and authenticity positioning. Your anti-corporate approach will help maintain credibility with culture-conscious buyers.

Let me model a channel mix for your $1.275M media budget:

**Paid Social (Instagram/TikTok): 60% = $765K**
- Native-style content that blends with organic feeds
- Influencer whitelisting for authentic reach

**Influencer Partnerships: 30% = $383K** 
- Authentic content creation + amplification
- Micro and mid-tier influencers in streetwear scene

**Search (Brand Protection): 10% = $128K**
- Protect brand terms, capture existing demand

This keeps you authentic while ensuring efficient customer acquisition. Does this allocation feel right, or would you shift budget between paid social and influencer partnerships?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Perfect. Your channel allocation maintains authenticity while ensuring scale - exactly what streetwear demands.

For measurement, authenticity-focused campaigns need different tracking approaches. Platform attribution often inflates results, especially when audiences overlap between Instagram and TikTok.

What measurement capabilities do you currently have? Can you track customer journeys from initial touchpoint to purchase, and do you have any way to test incrementality beyond platform reporting?

Turn 12:
Excellent. Your measurement framework will give you clean data to optimize against and prove campaign value.

For testing, let's build in systematic learning from launch. Given your focus on authentic content and cultural relevance, what specific elements would you want to test first?

I'd recommend starting with creative authenticity tests - comparing influencer-created content vs. brand-created content to validate your authenticity hypothesis. We could also test different storytelling approaches around your "cultural conversation" positioning.

What aspects of the campaign are you most uncertain about that testing could help resolve?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 11:
Got it. For a $1.5M campaign targeting authentic streetwear audiences, I'll recommend a practical measurement approach that builds on your current setup.

**Primary KPI: Cost per customer at $23**
- Simple to track and optimize against
- Aligns with your volume goals

**Attribution approach:**
- 7-day click, 1-day view windows (shorter than typical due to fast streetwear purchase cycles)
- Track Instagram and TikTok separately to understand channel contribution
- Use Google Analytics Enhanced Ecommerce for customer journey mapping

**Incrementality validation:**
- Start with geographic holdout tests - run campaigns in 20 of your 25 DMAs, hold out 5 similar markets
- Compare customer acquisition rates between test and control markets

This gives you actionable data without overwhelming your current capabilities. Would you prefer to focus on cost per customer as your primary success metric?

Turn 13:
Perfect testing priorities. Let's structure this to give you actionable learnings:

**Creative Source Test (Month 1-2):**
- Split: 50% influencer-created content vs. 50% internal creative
- Same targeting, budget allocation across both
- Measure: cost per customer, engagement rates, conversion quality

**Messaging Approach Test (Month 2-3):**
- Cultural storytelling vs. product-focused creative
- Test across both Instagram and TikTok
- Measure: which drives better customer acquisition at your $23 target

**Learning Integration:**
- Month 4+: Scale winning combinations
- Document what authentic content elements work best

This validates your core hypothesis while building a playbook for future campaigns.

Finally, let's identify risks. Your biggest vulnerability appears to be proving authenticity at scale - maintaining cultural credibility while spending $1.5M. What other risks concern you most?
