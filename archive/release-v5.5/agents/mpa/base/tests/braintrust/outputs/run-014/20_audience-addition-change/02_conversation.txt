TURN 1 (Step 1)

USER:
Hi, I'm VP of Marketing at WealthPath Advisors, a wealth management firm. I need to build a media plan to generate 5,000 qualified leads with a $2M budget. Our target is high-net-worth individuals 55+ who are approaching or in retirement, with $1M+ in investable assets. LTV is around $15K per client. We focus on the top 30 wealth markets in the US.

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me update our projections based on your input. $2M / 5,000 leads = $400 per lead. With $15K LTV, that's a 37.5x return - very strong unit economics that gives us excellent flexibility.

Your lead cost target is conservative for wealth management where typical runs $300-800 per qualified lead. This positions us well for premium channels and precise targeting.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 5,000 leads - is it converting them to new AUM, hitting a revenue target, or something else?

TURN 2 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our primary goal is growing our Assets Under Management (AUM). We want these 5,000 leads to translate into at least $75 million in new investable assets. Right now, we're seeing flat growth, and our leadership team is pushing us to expand our client base in the high-net-worth retirement segment.

AGENT:
Perfect. Let me model this out. $75M in new AUM from 5,000 leads means an average of $15K in assets per lead. 

That's quite conservative - with your target of $1M+ investable assets, typical wealth management sees $50K-150K average per qualified lead conversion. Your $15K assumption suggests either a lower conversion rate or you're being appropriately cautious in projections.

At $400 cost per lead targeting $15K average assets, you're spending 2.7% of acquired AUM on acquisition - very efficient compared to industry benchmarks of 3-5%.

How do you define a "qualified lead" for measurement purposes - is it someone who completes a consultation, meets asset thresholds, or something else specific?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 3 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're defining a qualified lead as someone with $1M+ in investable assets who completes an initial consultation with one of our wealth advisors. We want them to demonstrate serious interest by spending 45-60 minutes in a deep-dive financial planning discussion. Our current conversion rate from consultation to AUM is around 20%, which is why we're being conservative in our projections.

AGENT:
Excellent - that's a high-quality lead definition. Let me validate the math: 5,000 consultations at 20% conversion = 1,000 new clients. $75M / 1,000 = $75K average AUM per new client, which aligns much better with wealth management benchmarks.

Your $400 per consultation cost is realistic for this quality bar. Getting high-net-worth individuals to commit 45-60 minutes requires significant trust-building, which typically demands premium channels and longer consideration cycles.

Based on your input, your economics are solid and your lead definition is appropriately rigorous. Step 1 complete.

Now for economics validation: at $400 per consultation and $15K LTV per client, you need that 20% conversion rate to maintain profitability. If conversion drops to 15%, your effective cost per client jumps to $2,667 vs. your $15K LTV.

Is that 20% consultation-to-client conversion rate consistent across all lead sources, or do you see variation by channel or audience segment?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 4 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We've seen some variation, but it's not dramatic. Digital channels like LinkedIn tend to hover around 18-22%, while direct mail and targeted print in financial publications run closer to 22-25%. Our weakest channel is generic display advertising, which drops to about 12-15% conversion. We know we need to tighten our targeting and messaging to improve those lower-performing channels.

AGENT:
That variation is significant for budget allocation. At 25% vs 12% conversion, your cost per client ranges from $1,600 to $3,333 - more than double.

$2M budget / $1,600 = 1,250 potential clients from high-converting channels
$2M budget / $3,333 = 600 potential clients from low-converting channels

Your economics work well with disciplined channel selection. At $400 per consultation and 20%+ conversion rates, you're spending 10-13% of LTV on acquisition - very healthy for wealth management.

Step 2 complete - your efficiency targets are achievable with proper channel focus.

Moving to Step 3 - Audience. You mentioned high-net-worth individuals 55+ approaching retirement with $1M+ investable assets. Within that group, are there specific behavioral or life-stage signals that indicate higher intent - like recent job changes, inheritance, business sales, or divorce?

TURN 5 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We've seen strong signals around pre-retirees who are business owners looking to exit or transition their companies. They're typically more motivated, have complex financial needs, and are actively seeking comprehensive wealth management solutions. Recent divorcees over 55 with significant settlements are another high-intent segment for us - they're suddenly managing substantial assets and need strategic guidance. Our advisors are particularly skilled at navigating these complex life transitions, which makes our consultations more attractive to these specific audience segments.

AGENT:
Excellent audience intelligence. Business owners in transition and recent divorcees are high-intent segments with urgent, complex needs that align perfectly with your advisory expertise.

These life-stage triggers create natural urgency and higher consultation rates. Business exit planning and post-divorce wealth restructuring both require immediate professional guidance, which should improve your conversion rates above that 20% baseline.

For targeting precision: Are you seeing these high-intent prospects concentrated in specific wealth markets among your top 30, or do certain metros show stronger performance for business owner transitions vs. divorce settlements?

TURN 6 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
In our data, we're seeing the highest concentration of these segments in metropolitan areas like San Francisco, Seattle, Boston, and Dallas. Tech corridor cities with high entrepreneurial activity seem to yield more business owner transitions, while metros with significant professional populations like Chicago and New York show stronger divorce settlement demographics. Our internal research suggests these markets not only have higher concentrations of our target segments but also tend to have more complex financial situations that make our comprehensive wealth management approach particularly appealing.

AGENT:
Perfect segmentation insight. Tech corridors for business transitions and established professional metros for post-divorce wealth management - that geographic-psychographic overlay will drive much more efficient targeting.

Your top metros align well with wealth concentration. San Francisco, Seattle, Boston average $500K+ household incomes in target demographics, while Chicago and New York offer scale with complexity that favors comprehensive advisory services.

Step 3 complete - you have clear audience segments with geographic concentration.

Moving to Step 4 - Geography. Among your top 30 wealth markets, should we prioritize budget allocation toward these high-performing metros you mentioned, or do you need broader coverage for brand presence across all markets?

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 7 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We want a strategic concentration approach. I recommend allocating about 60-70% of our media budget to those six high-performance metros you mentioned - San Francisco, Seattle, Boston, Chicago, New York, and Dallas. These markets represent our highest concentration of business owners and high-net-worth professionals. The remaining 30-40% can provide baseline presence in other top wealth markets to maintain national brand awareness. Our goal is efficient targeting with some peripheral visibility.

AGENT:
Smart allocation strategy. Let me model this: 65% concentration = $1.3M across your top 6 metros, 35% distributed = $700K across remaining 24 markets.

$1.3M / 6 metros = ~$217K per priority market
$700K / 24 markets = ~$29K per secondary market

That 7:1 spending ratio creates meaningful impact in priority metros while maintaining visibility elsewhere. Your high-performance markets get sufficient budget for optimization and testing, while secondary markets maintain brand presence.

Step 4 complete - concentrated geographic strategy with national coverage.

Moving to Step 5 - Budget. Within that $1.3M for priority metros, should we weight spending toward business transition markets (SF, Seattle, Boston, Dallas) vs. professional/divorce markets (Chicago, NYC), or allocate evenly across all six?

Events: calculation_performed, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 8 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I recommend a slight weighting toward the business transition markets - about 55-60% of that $1.3M. So SF, Seattle, Boston, and Dallas would get around $715K-$780K, with Chicago and NYC splitting the remaining $520K-$585K. Our conversion data shows slightly higher intent and more complex financial needs in tech and entrepreneurial markets, which justifies the incremental investment. Plus, business owners tend to have larger asset pools, so the potential AUM return is higher in those markets.

AGENT:
Excellent prioritization. Let me calculate this out:

Business transition markets (SF, Seattle, Boston, Dallas): $780K / 4 = $195K each
Professional/divorce markets (Chicago, NYC): $520K / 2 = $260K each

That gives your highest-converting segments meaningful budget while recognizing NYC and Chicago's scale advantages. At $195K-260K per priority metro, you have sufficient budget for multi-channel strategies and optimization.

Step 5 complete - budget allocation aligns with audience performance data.

Moving to Step 6 - Value Proposition. For business owners approaching exit vs. recent divorcees managing settlements, do you use different messaging frameworks, or does your comprehensive wealth management approach translate consistently across both segments?
