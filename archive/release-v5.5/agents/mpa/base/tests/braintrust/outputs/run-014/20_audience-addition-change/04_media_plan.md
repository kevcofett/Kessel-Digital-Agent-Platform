# Media Plan Output: Audience Addition Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me update our projections based on your input. $2M / 5,000 leads = $400 per lead. With $15K LTV, that's a 37.5x return - very strong unit economics that gives us excellent flexibility.

Your lead cost target is conservative for wealth management where typical runs $300-800 per qualified lead. This positions us well for premium channels and precise targeting.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 5,000 leads - is it converting them to new AUM, hitting a revenue target, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect. Let me model this out. $75M in new AUM from 5,000 leads means an average of $15K in assets per lead. 

That's quite conservative - with your target of $1M+ investable assets, typical wealth management sees $50K-150K average per qualified lead conversion. Your $15K assumption suggests either a lower conversion rate or you're being appropriately cautious in projections.

At $400 cost per lead targeting $15K average assets, you're spending 2.7% of acquired AUM on acquisition - very efficient compared to industry benchmarks of 3-5%.

How do you define a "qualified lead" for measurement purposes - is it someone who completes a consultation, meets asset thresholds, or something else specific?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - that's a high-quality lead definition. Let me validate the math: 5,000 consultations at 20% conversion = 1,000 new clients. $75M / 1,000 = $75K average AUM per new client, which aligns much better with wealth management benchmarks.

Your $400 per consultation cost is realistic for this quality bar. Getting high-net-worth individuals to commit 45-60 minutes requires significant trust-building, which typically demands premium channels and longer consideration cycles.

Based on your input, your economics are solid and your lead definition is appropriately rigorous. Step 1 complete.

Now for economics validation: at $400 per consultation and $15K LTV per client, you need that 20% conversion rate to maintain profitability. If conversion drops to 15%, your effective cost per client jumps to $2,667 vs. your $15K LTV.

Is that 20% consultation-to-client conversion rate consistent across all lead sources, or do you see variation by channel or audience segment?

Turn 4:
That variation is significant for budget allocation. At 25% vs 12% conversion, your cost per client ranges from $1,600 to $3,333 - more than double.

$2M budget / $1,600 = 1,250 potential clients from high-converting channels
$2M budget / $3,333 = 600 potential clients from low-converting channels

Your economics work well with disciplined channel selection. At $400 per consultation and 20%+ conversion rates, you're spending 10-13% of LTV on acquisition - very healthy for wealth management.

Step 2 complete - your efficiency targets are achievable with proper channel focus.

Moving to Step 3 - Audience. You mentioned high-net-worth individuals 55+ approaching retirement with $1M+ investable assets. Within that group, are there specific behavioral or life-stage signals that indicate higher intent - like recent job changes, inheritance, business sales, or divorce?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Excellent audience intelligence. Business owners in transition and recent divorcees are high-intent segments with urgent, complex needs that align perfectly with your advisory expertise.

These life-stage triggers create natural urgency and higher consultation rates. Business exit planning and post-divorce wealth restructuring both require immediate professional guidance, which should improve your conversion rates above that 20% baseline.

For targeting precision: Are you seeing these high-intent prospects concentrated in specific wealth markets among your top 30, or do certain metros show stronger performance for business owner transitions vs. divorce settlements?

Turn 6:
Perfect segmentation insight. Tech corridors for business transitions and established professional metros for post-divorce wealth management - that geographic-psychographic overlay will drive much more efficient targeting.

Your top metros align well with wealth concentration. San Francisco, Seattle, Boston average $500K+ household incomes in target demographics, while Chicago and New York offer scale with complexity that favors comprehensive advisory services.

Step 3 complete - you have clear audience segments with geographic concentration.

Moving to Step 4 - Geography. Among your top 30 wealth markets, should we prioritize budget allocation toward these high-performing metros you mentioned, or do you need broader coverage for brand presence across all markets?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Smart allocation strategy. Let me model this: 65% concentration = $1.3M across your top 6 metros, 35% distributed = $700K across remaining 24 markets.

$1.3M / 6 metros = ~$217K per priority market
$700K / 24 markets = ~$29K per secondary market

That 7:1 spending ratio creates meaningful impact in priority metros while maintaining visibility elsewhere. Your high-performance markets get sufficient budget for optimization and testing, while secondary markets maintain brand presence.

Step 4 complete - concentrated geographic strategy with national coverage.

Moving to Step 5 - Budget. Within that $1.3M for priority metros, should we weight spending toward business transition markets (SF, Seattle, Boston, Dallas) vs. professional/divorce markets (Chicago, NYC), or allocate evenly across all six?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
Excellent prioritization. Let me calculate this out:

Business transition markets (SF, Seattle, Boston, Dallas): $780K / 4 = $195K each
Professional/divorce markets (Chicago, NYC): $520K / 2 = $260K each

That gives your highest-converting segments meaningful budget while recognizing NYC and Chicago's scale advantages. At $195K-260K per priority metro, you have sufficient budget for multi-channel strategies and optimization.

Step 5 complete - budget allocation aligns with audience performance data.

Moving to Step 6 - Value Proposition. For business owners approaching exit vs. recent divorcees managing settlements, do you use different messaging frameworks, or does your comprehensive wealth management approach translate consistently across both segments?
