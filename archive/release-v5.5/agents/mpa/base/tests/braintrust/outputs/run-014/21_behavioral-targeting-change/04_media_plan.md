# Media Plan Output: Behavioral Targeting Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by modeling your efficiency target. $800K ÷ 50,000 subscribers = $16 CAC against $420 LTV. That's a 26:1 LTV:CAC ratio - exceptionally strong for subscription businesses where 3-5:1 is typical.

Your efficiency target is very achievable, which gives us room for premium channels and broader testing.

What specific business outcome drives this 50K subscriber goal - is this about hitting revenue targets, market expansion, or proving unit economics at scale?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your objective is proving scalability for investment while capturing market share, with 50,000 new subscribers as the primary success metric.

Your $16 CAC target is very conservative for subscription businesses - most successful DTC brands operate at 5-10:1 LTV:CAC ratios, so your 26:1 gives us significant flexibility for premium targeting and channel testing.

Given your strong unit economics, we could potentially be more aggressive on subscriber acquisition if that better serves your growth and investor story.

Is 50,000 subscribers the right target, or would a higher volume better demonstrate the scalability you need to show investors?

Turn 4:
Excellent - triathletes and marathon runners are higher-intent, higher-value segments than general fitness enthusiasts. These audiences typically convert 2-3x better than broad fitness targeting.

This creates an interesting strategic choice. We could start narrow with proven triathlon/marathon segments for efficient acquisition, or test broader endurance categories to discover new high-value segments.

Given your 50K target and investor timeline, what's your preference - focus on proven high-converting segments first, or allocate budget to test adjacent endurance communities like cyclists, ultrarunners, or obstacle racers?

Turn 5:
Perfect strategy. Triathletes and marathon runners as core focus, with expansion testing after proving the model.

For targeting precision, we'll need to layer behavioral and demographic signals. Beyond the activity type, what other characteristics define your highest-value subscribers - income level, training frequency, race participation, supplement purchasing behavior, or specific brands they follow?

The more precisely we can define your ideal customer profile, the more efficiently we'll hit that $16 CAC target.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Smart approach - credible execution beats overreaching. 50,000 subscribers at $16 CAC is our target.

Your economics are very strong, which means we can focus on sustainable acquisition channels rather than chasing the cheapest traffic. With $420 LTV, you're profitable on first purchase even at higher CACs.

Now let's define your target audience. You mentioned fitness enthusiasts 25-55. For endurance nutrition, we typically see tighter segments perform better than broad fitness targeting.

What specific endurance activities do your best customers participate in - running, cycling, triathlon, or something else?

Turn 6:
Excellent profile - affluent, data-driven endurance athletes with premium purchasing behavior. This gives us strong targeting signals across demographics, interests, and behaviors.

Let me capture your audience definition:

**Primary Audience: Elite Endurance Athletes**
- Activities: Triathletes and marathon runners
- Demographics: Age 25-55, HHI $100K+, professionals
- Behaviors: Train 4-6x/week, 2-3 major races annually
- Interests: Garmin/premium gear, Strava, Ben Greenfield, GNC
- Psychographics: Data-driven, performance-focused, premium buyers

This is a well-defined, high-intent audience that should convert efficiently at your $16 CAC target.

Now for geography - you mentioned targeting across the US initially. Are there specific regions or metro areas where endurance sports are stronger, or do you want to test nationally from the start?

Turn 7:
Smart approach - weighted national with concentration in proven high-performance metros.

Let me model your geography strategy:

**Primary DMAs (60% of budget allocation):**
- San Francisco Bay Area
- Boston 
- New York
- Denver

**Secondary DMAs (40% of budget allocation):**
- National expansion testing in metros with strong endurance communities

For targeting precision, we should identify 10-15 total DMAs. Beyond your proven four, which metros would you prioritize for expansion testing - areas like Seattle, Portland, Austin, Chicago, or markets near major marathon/triathlon events?

Turn 8:
Perfect. Let me structure your geography strategy with target audience sizing:

**GEOGRAPHY PLAN - WEIGHTED NATIONAL**

| DMA | Total Population | Target Audience Size | Target % | Priority |
|-----|-----------------|---------------------|----------|----------|
| San Francisco Bay Area | 7.8M | 156K | 2.0% | Primary |
| New York | 20.2M | 303K | 1.5% | Primary |
| Boston | 4.9M | 98K | 2.0% | Primary |
| Denver | 3.1M | 68K | 2.2% | Primary |
| Seattle | 4.0M | 80K | 2.0% | Secondary |
| Austin | 2.3M | 46K | 2.0% | Secondary |
| Chicago | 9.5M | 143K | 1.5% | Secondary |
| Miami | 2.8M | 42K | 1.5% | Secondary |
| San Diego | 3.3M | 66K | 2.0% | Secondary |
| **TOTAL TOP 9 DMAS** | **58.0M** | **1.0M** | **1.7%** | |

This gives us 1 million target prospects across your priority markets. At 50K subscribers needed, that's a 5% conversion rate requirement - very achievable for your high-intent audience.

How does this geographic concentration look for your launch strategy?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 9:
Excellent. Your geography strategy is locked: weighted national with 60% focus on your four proven metros, 40% testing expansion markets.

Now for budget allocation. With $800K total budget, we need to split between media spend and operational costs. Industry standard is 85-90% media, 10-15% for creative, landing pages, and campaign management.

At 85% media allocation, that's $680K for acquisition across your 9 priority DMAs. This gives us $75K+ per primary market - enough budget for meaningful testing and optimization.

How do you want to structure your budget split between media spend and operational costs?

Turn 10:
Perfect. $696K media spend with $104K for operations gives us strong acquisition power plus quality creative infrastructure.

Now let's develop your value proposition framework. With your premium positioning and data-driven audience, your messaging needs to differentiate from general sports nutrition.

Based on your audience profile - performance-focused professionals who follow Ben Greenfield and use premium gear - what specific performance benefits or competitive advantages does EnduraFuel deliver that resonates most with serious endurance athletes?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 11:
Excellent positioning - science-backed metabolic optimization with quantifiable performance benefits. This aligns perfectly with your data-driven audience.

**VALUE PROPOSITION FRAMEWORK:**

**Core Promise:** Science-backed nutrition for metabolic optimization and quantifiable performance gains

**Key Pillars:**
- Professional athlete-tested formulations
- Sustained energy release (vs. sugar crashes)
- Faster recovery metrics
- Metabolic efficiency optimization

**Audience Resonance:** Appeals to data-driven athletes who track performance metrics and want measurable improvements

This messaging should perform well with your Garmin-wearing, performance-tracking audience who follow evidence-based approaches like Ben Greenfield's.

Now we're ready for channel strategy. With $696K media budget, proven audience segments, and strong unit economics, we can build an effective channel mix.

What channels are you currently using, and which have performed best for acquiring your target triathlete/marathon runner segments?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 12:
Great foundation - Meta performing well for your target segments, podcasts building credibility but lower conversion. This gives us proven channels to scale plus expansion opportunities.

**RECOMMENDED CHANNEL MIX - $696K MEDIA BUDGET:**

**Tier 1 - Scale Proven (60% = $418K)**
- Meta (Facebook/Instagram): $350K - Your best converter
- Google Search: $68K - High-intent endurance nutrition terms

**Tier 2 - Strategic Expansion (30% = $209K)**

This prioritizes scaling your proven Meta success while testing channels that reach your data-driven professionals where they consume endurance content.

How does this channel allocation align with your growth strategy?
