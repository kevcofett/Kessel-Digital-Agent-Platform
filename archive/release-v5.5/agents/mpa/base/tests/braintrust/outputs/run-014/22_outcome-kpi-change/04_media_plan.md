# Media Plan Output: Outcome KPI Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me confirm your business outcome: You want to acquire 25,000 new insurance policies. Is policy acquisition your primary success metric, or do you also track premium volume or another KPI as your main measure of success?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your primary KPI is 25,000 new policies, with first-year premium volume as a quality indicator to ensure we're acquiring the right customers.

Let me run the economics: $5M ÷ 25,000 policies = $200 customer acquisition cost. With your $2,800 LTV, that's a 14:1 LTV:CAC ratio - excellent for insurance where 8-12:1 is typical.

Your $200 target CAC is conservative compared to insurance benchmarks of $250-400, which gives us good efficiency cushion. This looks very achievable.

What's your typical first-year premium per policy? This will help us model the revenue quality alongside the acquisition volume.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Perfect insight. Home purchase creates urgency, necessity, and financial capacity - the ideal conversion environment.

This gives us a highly targetable moment with strong intent signals. New homeowners are also easier to identify through data signals like mortgage applications, real estate transactions, and moving behaviors.

For your 25,000 policy target, we'll need to reach roughly 250,000-500,000 recent home buyers annually, depending on conversion rates. Your affluent focus ($100K+ income) probably narrows this to major metro markets where home values support that income threshold.

Which geographic markets are your priority? Are you focused on specific states, metro areas, or is this a national campaign?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent. Let me update our model: 25,000 policies × $1,200 = $30M first-year premium revenue from a $5M investment. That's a 6:1 first-year return before considering the full $2,800 LTV.

Your $200 CAC targeting affluent homeowners is very realistic. High-income segments typically convert better despite higher CPMs, and your premium volume validates the customer quality focus.

This efficiency target positions you well competitively. The economics are solid - conservative CAC with strong LTV and immediate premium payback.

Now let's define your audience precisely. You mentioned homeowners 35-65 with $100K+ income experiencing life events. Which of these life events is most predictive of insurance shopping in your experience: home purchase, new baby, or retirement planning?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Got it. National reach with concentration in high-value markets makes perfect sense for maximizing efficiency while maintaining scale.

Let me model the target audience sizing for these priority markets:

**PRIORITY STATES TARGET AUDIENCE ANALYSIS**

| State | Total Population | Home Purchases/Year | $100K+ Income HHs | Target Audience Est. |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| California | 39.5M | 450K | 35% | 158K |
| Texas | 30.0M | 380K | 28% | 106K |
| Florida | 22.6M | 320K | 25% | 80K |
| New York | 19.3M | 180K | 32% | 58K |
| Illinois | 12.6M | 120K | 30% | 36K |
| **Priority States** | **124.0M** | **1.45M** | **30%** | **438K** |
| Other 45 States | 206.0M | 1.8M | 25% | 450K |
| **National Total** | **330.0M** | **3.25M** | **27%** | **888K** |

Your 25,000 target represents about 2.8% of the national qualified audience - very achievable. The priority states contain roughly 50% of your target market.

Should we allocate budget proportionally to audience concentration, or do you want heavier weighting toward the priority markets?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Perfect allocation strategy. Let me model the budget split:

**BUDGET ALLOCATION BY MARKET PRIORITY**

- **Priority 5 States**: 62.5% = $3.125M
  - Target: 15,625 policies (62.5% of 25K)
  - Implied CAC: $200 (maintains efficiency target)

- **National Reach**: 37.5% = $1.875M  
  - Target: 9,375 policies (37.5% of 25K)
  - Implied CAC: $200 (consistent efficiency)

This gives you 2.8x budget concentration vs. audience density in priority markets while maintaining national presence. The $200 CAC holds across both tiers, which is realistic given priority markets have higher CPMs but also higher conversion rates for your affluent audience.

Your value proposition will be crucial for standing out in these competitive, high-value markets. What's TrustGuard's key differentiator when competing for affluent new homeowners - is it coverage breadth, pricing, service quality, or specialized protection features?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Excellent positioning. "Trusted partner for comprehensive protection" resonates strongly with affluent homeowners who view insurance as risk management, not just compliance.

Your white-glove service differentiator is particularly powerful for new homeowners - they're making their largest financial commitment and want confidence their investment is truly protected. The personalized approach also justifies premium pricing to your target demographic.

This value proposition works well across channels - from search ("comprehensive home insurance") to social proof content showcasing service excellence. The partnership angle builds trust that's essential for high-consideration financial decisions.

Now let's get into channel strategy. Given your $200 CAC target, new homeowner focus, and service-driven value prop, which channels are you currently using or considering? I'm thinking about the full mix - search, social, display, direct mail, partnerships, etc.

Turn 8:
Excellent foundation. Your current digital base is solid, and your expansion thinking is spot-on for this audience.

Let me analyze channel fit for affluent new homeowners:

**HIGH-IMPACT CHANNELS FOR YOUR AUDIENCE:**

**Search (Google)** - Essential. New homeowners actively research "home insurance" with high intent. Your current investment here is smart.

**Programmatic Display** - Perfect for recent buyer targeting using real estate transaction data. Premium placements on financial/real estate sites reach your audience in relevant contexts.

**Direct Mail** - Highly effective for new homeowners. Real estate data enables precise timing (30-60 days post-purchase). Physical mail stands out and conveys premium service quality.

**Connected TV/Streaming** - Reaches affluent households during evening viewing. Builds trust through premium format that reinforces white-glove positioning.

**LinkedIn** - Often overlooked but excellent for $100K+ professionals. Lower volume but very high-quality prospects.

Given your $200 CAC target and service positioning, what percentage of your $5M budget feels right for your proven digital channels (Search/Social) versus expanding into these new channels?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Smart allocation. Let me model this channel strategy:

**CHANNEL MIX ALLOCATION**

**Proven Digital (52.5% = $2.625M)**
- Google Search: $1.575M (31.5%)
- Meta/Instagram: $1.05M (21%)

**Strategic Expansion (47.5% = $2.375M)**
- Programmatic Display: $1.1M (22%)
- Direct Mail: $950K (19%)
- Connected TV: $325K (6.5%)

This keeps your performance foundation while investing meaningfully in precise targeting channels. The 22% programmatic allocation can leverage real estate transaction data effectively, and 19% direct mail provides substantial reach to new homeowners.

**Key interdependency**: Search will likely see attribution shifts as upper-funnel channels (CTV, display) drive brand searches. Your current search performance may improve with this expanded mix.

For measurement, how do you currently track conversions across channels? Do you have attribution modeling in place, or are you primarily using last-click attribution?

Turn 10:
Excellent awareness. Last-click severely undervalues your planned upper-funnel investment and will make CTV/display look ineffective when they're actually driving conversions that search captures credit for.

**MEASUREMENT STRATEGY FOR YOUR MIX:**

**Multi-Touch Attribution (MTA)**: Essential for your channel mix. Models like time-decay or position-based will better credit programmatic and CTV's influence on search conversions.

**Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM)**: Critical for understanding CTV impact, which is hard to track directly. Models overall media effect on policy volume.

**Incrementality Testing**: Test channels individually to validate true lift. Geo-holdout tests work well for CTV and direct mail.

**Unified Tracking**: Customer journey from initial touch through policy purchase. Insurance buying cycles are 2-4 weeks, so attribution windows need adjustment.

Given your sophisticated channel mix and $5M budget, measurement infrastructure investment is crucial. Many insurance marketers underestimate attribution complexity and make poor optimization decisions.

What's your current conversion cycle length from first touch to policy purchase? This affects attribution window settings and budget pacing decisions.

Turn 11:
Perfect data point. Your 28-35 day cycle confirms why last-click attribution fails - it misses 3-4 weeks of upper-funnel influence.

**ATTRIBUTION WINDOWS FOR YOUR CYCLE:**
- **View-through**: 30 days (captures display/CTV influence)
- **Click-through**: 35 days (full consideration period)
- **Cross-device tracking**: Essential given research-heavy journey

**MEASUREMENT RECOMMENDATIONS:**
- **Time-decay attribution**: More credit to recent touches but values early awareness
- **Conversion lag reporting**: Track by channel to optimize pacing
- **Assisted conversion analysis**: See how CTV/display influence search performance

Your deliberate buyer journey actually strengthens the case for programmatic and CTV investment - these channels build awareness and trust during that 3-4 week consideration period.

Now for testing strategy. With your sophisticated mix and measurement needs, which elements would you want to test first: channel allocation, creative messaging, or audience targeting precision? Testing discipline will be crucial for optimizing this expanded channel portfolio.

Turn 13:
Excellent hypothesis based on solid customer insights. Move-up buyers in that income/home value band are ideal - they have experience with insurance complexity and appreciate premium service, but aren't at ultra-high-net-worth levels where they'd use specialized carriers.

**RISK ASSESSMENT FOR YOUR PLAN:**

**Primary Risk: Attribution Complexity**
- Multi-channel mix with 28-35 day cycles creates measurement challenges
- Mitigation: Invest in proper attribution infrastructure before scaling

**Secondary Risk: Channel Learning Curves**
- CTV and programmatic require 4-6 weeks to optimize
- Mitigation: Phase rollout, maintain search/social performance during ramp

**Efficiency Risk: Premium Targeting Costs**
- Affluent audiences have higher CPMs across all channels
- Mitigation: Your conservative $200 CAC provides cushion vs. $250-400 benchmarks

**Market Risk: Seasonal Real Estate Cycles**
- Spring/summer home buying peaks affect audience availability
- Mitigation: Budget pacing aligned to real estate seasonality

Your plan is well-structured with solid economics and smart targeting. The biggest success factor will be measurement infrastructure to properly optimize the expanded channel mix. Ready to move forward with this strategy?

Turn 14:
Perfect. You've built a strong, realistic plan with proper risk management and measurement discipline.

**PLAN SUMMARY:**
- **Target**: 25,000 policies, $5M budget, $200 CAC
- **Audience**: $150K-250K income, suburban move-up buyers, $600K-800K homes
- **Geography**: 62.5% priority states, 37.5% national reach
- **Channels**: 52.5% proven digital, 47.5% strategic expansion
- **Testing Priority**: Audience precision first, then creative/channel optimization
- **Measurement**: Multi-touch attribution investment before scaling

**QUARTERLY REVIEW FRAMEWORK:**
- CAC performance vs. $200 target by channel
- Policy volume pacing vs. 25K annual goal
- Attribution model performance and optimization insights
- Channel efficiency trends and reallocation opportunities

Your phased approach and measurement-first mindset set this up for success. The conservative CAC target gives you optimization room, and your customer insights will drive precise targeting.

You're ready to execute. Focus on attribution infrastructure first, then systematically test and scale. This plan positions TrustGuard to efficiently acquire high-value customers while building a sustainable, measurable growth engine.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 12:
Excellent prioritization. Targeting precision directly impacts CAC efficiency and will inform both creative strategy and channel optimization.

**TESTING FRAMEWORK FOR AUDIENCE PRECISION:**

**Geographic Segmentation Test:**
- Urban vs. Suburban vs. Exurban new homeowners
- Home value tiers ($400K-600K vs. $600K-800K vs. $800K+)
- Hypothesis: Higher home values = higher conversion + LTV

**Income Band Testing:**
- $100K-150K vs. $150K-250K vs. $250K+
- Hypothesis: Sweet spot likely $150K-250K (need + ability)

**Life Stage Refinement:**
- First-time buyers vs. move-up buyers vs. downsizers
- Age bands within 35-65 (35-45 vs. 45-55 vs. 55-65)

**Behavioral Signals:**
- Recent mortgage vs. cash buyers
- Days since home purchase (30-60 vs. 60-90 vs. 90-120)

Start with geographic and income testing in programmatic - easiest to isolate and measure. Which of these segments do you suspect converts best based on your current customer data?
