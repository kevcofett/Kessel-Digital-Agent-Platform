USER:
Hey, I'm the growth lead at QuickSend. We're a remittance fintech looking to acquire 10,000 new users this quarter with a $500K media spend. Let's build out the media strategy.

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start - acquiring 10,000 users with $500K gives us $50 per user to work with. For remittance fintech, that's aggressive but achievable with tight execution.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve beyond user acquisition? Are you focused on transaction volume, revenue growth, or market expansion into new corridors?

TURN 2 (Step 3)

USER:
Our primary focus is revenue growth, specifically increasing total transaction volume. We want to expand our market share in the US remittance market by attracting more first-generation immigrant users who send money internationally. The 10,000 user target is really about building a more robust customer base that can drive higher transaction frequencies.

AGENT:
Excellent. Revenue growth through transaction volume is your objective, and 10,000 new users is the path there. 

Now I need to understand how you'll measure success as a number. What's your primary KPI - total transaction volume in dollars, average transactions per user, or something else?

And what's your target for that KPI? For example, if it's transaction volume, what dollar amount are you aiming for from these 10,000 new users?

TURN 3 (Step 1)

USER:
We're targeting $10 million in total transaction volume from these new users. Our primary KPI will be total transaction volume, with a secondary focus on average transactions per user. We think if we can get each new user to do at least three transactions in their first year, we'll hit our growth targets.

AGENT:
Perfect. Let me update our economics: $10M transaction volume from 10,000 users = $1,000 average per user annually. At 3 transactions per user, that's ~$333 per transaction.

Assuming typical 2-3% transaction fees for remittance, you're projecting $200K-$300K revenue from these users. With $500K acquisition spend, you're investing 1.7-2.5x first-year revenue to acquire them.

This suggests you're banking on strong LTV beyond year one. What's your typical customer lifetime value, or how long do customers usually stay active with QuickSend?
