TURN 1 (Step 1)

USER:
Hi! I'm looking to get more people to buy shoes from our online store. Can you help me figure out the best way to do that?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve - are you looking to get more customers, increase sales from existing customers, or something else?

TURN 2 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I want to get more people buying our shoes. Right now, we're not selling as much online as we'd like, so I'm hoping we can find ways to attract new customers and increase our overall sales.

AGENT:
Perfect! So you want to attract new customers to increase overall sales. 

How will you measure success - are you focused on hitting a specific number of new customers, reaching a certain sales revenue target, or something else?

USER:
We have about $250,000 to spend this year, and I'd love to see our online sales go up by maybe 30-40%. But honestly, I don't have super precise targets yet. I just know we need to sell more shoes and get our brand out there more.

AGENT:
Got it! With a $250,000 budget and wanting 30-40% sales growth, let me help you get more specific so we can build a realistic plan.

What's your current annual online sales revenue? This will help us figure out what that 30-40% growth actually means in dollars and how many new customers you'd need to hit it.

TURN 4 (Step 2)

USER:
I'm not entirely sure of our exact online sales revenue. I think we did around $500,000 last year, but I'd have to double-check with our finance team. So if we want 30-40% growth, that would mean getting to around $650,000 to $700,000, right? We definitely know we want to sell more shoes online.

AGENT:
Exactly right! $500K to $650-700K means you need about $150-200K in new revenue.

To figure out if your $250K budget can realistically get you there, I need to understand your average order - what does a typical customer spend when they buy shoes from you?

TURN 5 (Step 2)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I'm not totally sure of our exact average order value. I think our shoes range from like $80 to $150, so maybe around $110 per order? But that's just a rough guess. We have different styles and prices, so it could vary.

AGENT:
Perfect! Let me model this. At $110 per order and targeting $175K in new revenue (middle of your $150-200K range), you'd need about 1,590 new customers.

$250K budget ÷ 1,590 customers = $157 per customer to acquire them.

For shoe retailers, the cost to get a new customer typically runs $50-80. At $157, you'd need to spend about twice the typical amount. This is aggressive but not impossible - it would require very tight targeting and efficient channels.

Does spending $157 to get a customer who buys $110 worth of shoes make sense for your business, or would you prefer to adjust either the budget or the growth target?
