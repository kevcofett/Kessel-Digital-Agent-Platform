# Media Plan Output: Basic User - Steps 1-2 Completion

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve - are you looking to get more customers, increase sales from existing customers, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect! So you want to attract new customers to increase overall sales. 

How will you measure success - are you focused on hitting a specific number of new customers, reaching a certain sales revenue target, or something else?

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Exactly right! $500K to $650-700K means you need about $150-200K in new revenue.

To figure out if your $250K budget can realistically get you there, I need to understand your average order - what does a typical customer spend when they buy shoes from you?

Turn 5:
Perfect! Let me model this. At $110 per order and targeting $175K in new revenue (middle of your $150-200K range), you'd need about 1,590 new customers.

$250K budget ÷ 1,590 customers = $157 per customer to acquire them.

For shoe retailers, the cost to get a new customer typically runs $50-80. At $157, you'd need to spend about twice the typical amount. This is aggressive but not impossible - it would require very tight targeting and efficient channels.

Does spending $157 to get a customer who buys $110 worth of shoes make sense for your business, or would you prefer to adjust either the budget or the growth target?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it! With a $250,000 budget and wanting 30-40% sales growth, let me help you get more specific so we can build a realistic plan.

What's your current annual online sales revenue? This will help us figure out what that 30-40% growth actually means in dollars and how many new customers you'd need to hit it.
