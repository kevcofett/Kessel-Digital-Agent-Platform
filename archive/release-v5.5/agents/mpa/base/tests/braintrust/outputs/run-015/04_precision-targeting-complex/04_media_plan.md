# Media Plan Output: Precision Targeting with Complex Attributes

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I am excited to build a media plan with you. We will cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start - you've provided excellent detail. Let me immediately assess your efficiency target: $1.5M ÷ 2,500 leads = $600 per qualified lead. For HNW wealth management, this is conservative - industry typically runs $800-1,200 per qualified lead given the audience exclusivity and longer sales cycles.

Your target is achievable and gives us room for quality focus over volume optimization.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 2,500 qualified leads?

Turn 3:
Perfect - consultation bookings as your primary KPI makes complete sense as the leading indicator. Let me update our efficiency model:

2,500 qualified leads → 375-500 consultations (15-20% rate) → 30-60 new clients (8-12% conversion)

At $1.5M budget, that's:
- $600 per qualified lead 
- $3,000-4,000 per consultation booking
- $25,000-50,000 per converted client

For wealth management, $3,000-4,000 per consultation is aggressive but achievable with precise targeting. The $25K-50K client acquisition cost is excellent given your $1.25-1.9M AUM targets.

Your economics look strong. The 15-20% consultation rate is optimistic - industry typically sees 8-15% for cold leads, but achievable with your liquidity event focus and quality targeting.

Step 1 complete. Ready to move to audience definition?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Excellent - $250-500M in new AUM is a substantial growth target. Let me model the economics: at your midpoint of $375M in new AUM from 2,500 leads, that's $150K average AUM per lead. With typical wealth management conversion rates of 8-12%, you'd need each converted client to bring roughly $1.25-1.9M in AUM.

This aligns well with your HNW targeting and is realistic for the liquidity event/retirement transition audience.

How do you measure success as a number - is it qualified leads generated, consultation bookings, or actual AUM converted within a specific timeframe?

Turn 4:
Excellent - your 50K client CRM is a massive advantage for lookalike modeling. Let's build precision targeting around your transition moments.

Your CRM data will enable the highest-performing audience strategy. I recommend segmenting your existing clients by value and recency to create tiered lookalikes:
- Tier 1: Top 20% clients by AUM (premium lookalikes)
- Tier 2: Recent acquisitions within 12 months (conversion-optimized)
- Tier 3: Clients acquired during liquidity events (life-stage matched)

For your transition targeting, we need to layer behavioral and contextual signals. Beyond the 45-65, $1M+ investable assets baseline, what specific behavioral indicators help you identify someone approaching a liquidity event or retirement transition?

For example: business sale research, estate planning content consumption, tax optimization searches, or retirement planning tools usage?

Turn 5:
Perfect - those behavioral signals are gold for contextual targeting. You've identified the precise moment of intent that drives quality conversions.

Let me map your targeting layers:

**Core Demographics:** 45-65, executives/business owners, $1M+ investable assets

**Behavioral Intent Signals:**
- Business exit strategy research
- M&A valuation guide downloads  
- Capital gains tax mitigation content
- Retirement transition planning engagement
- Business succession legal research
- Tax optimization whitepaper consumption
- Estate planning webinar attendance

**CRM Lookalike Strategy:**
- Tier 1: Top 20% AUM clients (premium modeling)
- Tier 2: Recent 12-month acquisitions 
- Tier 3: Liquidity event clients (transition-matched)

This creates a highly qualified but necessarily small audience pool. Estimated addressable audience across your 10 DMAs would be roughly 200K-400K individuals meeting all criteria.

Given this precision targeting will limit scale, what's your frequency tolerance for this audience? Are you comfortable with higher frequency to ensure message penetration during their transition research phase?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Excellent - 4-6 weekly impressions with value-driven messaging is spot-on for this audience. High-value prospects expect authoritative content during major transitions.

Your targeting precision is strong. Let me estimate audience sizing across your 10 target DMAs:

**Estimated Qualified Audience by Market:**
- NYC: ~45,000-55,000 (highest HNW concentration)
- SF/Bay Area: ~35,000-45,000 (tech liquidity events)
- LA: ~25,000-35,000 
- Chicago: ~20,000-30,000
- Boston: ~18,000-25,000
- Seattle: ~15,000-22,000 (tech executives)
- DC: ~15,000-20,000 (government contractors/executives)
- Dallas: ~12,000-18,000
- Denver: ~8,000-12,000
- Miami: ~10,000-15,000

**Total Addressable: ~200,000-275,000 qualified individuals**

At 4-6 weekly frequency, you'll need roughly 800K-1.6M weekly impressions across all markets.

Step 3 complete. Ready to move to geography planning and see how we should weight your $1.5M budget across these DMAs based on HNW concentration and opportunity sizing?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Smart allocation strategy - those three markets are your premium hunting grounds. Let me model your weighted budget distribution:

**Tier 1 Markets (50-60% of $1.5M = $750K-900K):**
- NYC: $350K-400K (highest volume + value)
- SF/Bay Area: $250K-300K (tech liquidity concentration) 
- Boston: $150K-200K (financial services density)

**Tier 2 Markets (25-30% = $375K-450K):**
- Chicago: $120K-140K
- LA: $100K-130K
- Seattle: $80K-100K (tech executives)
- DC: $75K-80K

**Tier 3 Markets (15-20% = $225K-300K):**
- Dallas: $75K-100K
- Miami: $75K-100K
- Denver: $75K-100K

This weighting gives you 3-4x spend concentration in your highest-value markets while maintaining presence across all target DMAs.

At these allocations, your cost per qualified lead will vary by market - likely $400-500 in Tier 1 markets, $600-700 in Tier 2/3 due to competition density.

Does this geographic weighting align with your CRM performance data, or should we adjust any market allocations?

Turn 8:
Perfect - your geographic allocation is locked in with strong data backing. The tiered structure gives you both strategic focus and tactical flexibility.

Step 4 complete. Now let's move to Step 5: Budget allocation within your $1.5M framework.

We've established your geographic weighting. Now we need to determine how to allocate budget across:

**Funnel Stages:**
- Upper funnel (awareness/education during transition research)
- Middle funnel (consideration/evaluation) 
- Lower funnel (consultation booking conversion)

Given your audience is actively researching transition strategies, they're likely mid-to-lower funnel already. However, your premium positioning may benefit from thought leadership presence.

What percentage of your $1.5M budget should focus on capturing existing demand (lower funnel) versus creating demand through thought leadership and educational content (upper funnel)?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Excellent funnel allocation - that 30/40/30 split perfectly matches your sophisticated audience's research journey. Let me model your budget distribution:

**Upper Funnel - Thought Leadership (30% = $450K):**
- Brand positioning and authority building
- Educational content on transition strategies
- Industry expertise demonstration

**Middle Funnel - Consideration (40% = $600K):** 
- Tax optimization expertise showcase
- Estate planning thought leadership
- Competitive differentiation content

**Lower Funnel - Conversion (30% = $450K):**
- Consultation booking optimization
- Direct response tactics
- Retargeting qualified prospects

This insights-driven approach aligns perfectly with executive decision-making patterns - they want to evaluate expertise before engaging.

Your $600 blended cost per lead breaks down to roughly:
- $750-900 per upper funnel lead (premium positioning)
- $500-600 per middle funnel lead (consideration stage)
- $400-500 per lower funnel lead (high-intent conversion)

Step 5 complete. Ready to develop your value proposition framework that will drive messaging across all three funnel stages?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Excellent value proposition foundation - you're positioning LuxeFinance as the strategic architect for wealth transitions, not just an asset manager.

Let me frame your messaging hierarchy across funnel stages:

**Upper Funnel - Authority Positioning:**
"Turning Transition Complexity Into Strategic Advantage"
- Position liquidity events as wealth optimization opportunities
- Demonstrate deep understanding of executive transition challenges

**Middle Funnel - Expertise Differentiation:**
"Tax-Intelligent Wealth Strategies for Life's Biggest Moments"
- Showcase specific tax optimization expertise
- Prove holistic planning beyond basic asset management

**Lower Funnel - Partnership Promise:**
"Your Strategic Partner for Wealth Transition Success"
- Direct consultation value proposition
- Clear pathway from complexity to clarity

This messaging evolution moves from broad authority to specific expertise to personal partnership.

Key proof points across all stages: CRM-validated success stories, tax savings quantification, estate planning outcomes, and post-transition wealth growth metrics.

Step 6 complete. Ready to move to Step 7 and determine which channels will best deliver this value proposition to your precisely-targeted HNW audience across your geographic markets?
