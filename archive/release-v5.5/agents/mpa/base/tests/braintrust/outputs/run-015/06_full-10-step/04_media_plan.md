# Media Plan Output: Full 10-Step Media Planning

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business objective. You mentioned acquiring 15,000 new customers - is customer acquisition your primary business outcome, or are you also focused on revenue growth, brand awareness, or market expansion?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So customer acquisition is your primary objective with a focus on quality customers who drive meaningful revenue. 

To define success clearly, what's your primary KPI - how will you measure if this campaign succeeds? Are you tracking total customers acquired, revenue generated, or something like revenue per new customer?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent. So your primary KPI is revenue per new customer with a $300 target. Let me check the math: 15,000 customers × $300 = $4.5M in revenue from new customers.

With your $750K budget targeting 15,000 customers, that's $50 per customer acquisition cost. At $300 revenue per customer, you're looking at a 6:1 return on ad spend.

For home decor and furniture, typical customer acquisition costs run $60-120, so $50 is aggressive but achievable with tight targeting. The 6:1 ROAS is strong for this category.

What's your typical profit margin on a $300 order? This helps us assess if the unit economics work long-term.

Turn 4:
Perfect. Let me update the economics: $300 revenue × 35% margin = $105 gross profit per customer. With $50 acquisition cost, you net $55 profit per customer - that's healthy 2.1x profit-to-CAC ratio.

Your $50 target is definitely aggressive for home decor (market typically $60-120), but the strong margins give you room to work. To hit this efficiency, we'll need precise audience targeting and optimized channel selection.

This completes our economics foundation. The math works if execution is tight.

Now let's define your ideal customer. When you think about your highest-value customers who spend $300+, what are the key characteristics that define them? Are they homeowners, renters, specific age ranges, or income levels?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Great profile. Homeowners 30-55, $100K+ household income, design-conscious professionals in urban/suburban areas. This audience values quality and durability over price alone.

A few follow-up signals to sharpen targeting: Do these customers tend to be new homeowners, recent movers, or established homeowners doing refresh projects? And are there specific life events that trigger their purchases - like home purchases, renovations, or seasonal decorating?

Turn 6:
Excellent insights. Recent movers and 2-3 year homeowners during seasonal refresh periods - that's very targetable. Spring refresh and holiday prep are strong purchase triggers.

This gives us clear behavioral and timing signals for audience targeting.

Now for geography - you mentioned urban and suburban areas work best. Are you targeting nationally, or do you have specific regions, states, or metro areas that perform better for your business?

Turn 7:
Perfect. Focusing on high-performing metros makes sense - SF Bay Area, NYC, Boston, Seattle, Atlanta, Austin, and Denver. These markets align with your $100K+ household income targets and design-conscious demographics.

Concentrating spend in proven markets should help hit that aggressive $50 CAC target rather than spreading thin nationally.

Now let's talk budget allocation. You have $750K total. How are you thinking about splitting this between your top-performing metros? Should we weight toward your strongest markets like SF Bay Area and NYC, or distribute more evenly across all seven markets?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Smart allocation. SF Bay Area and NYC get $300K (40%) given their higher LTVs, with $450K across Boston, Seattle, Atlanta, Austin, and Denver - roughly $90K per market.

This geographic focus should help hit your $50 CAC target by concentrating spend where conversion rates are proven strong.

Now let's develop your value proposition. You mentioned customers value quality, design, and durability. When these design-conscious homeowners are comparing you to competitors, what's your strongest differentiator? Is it product quality, design curation, price point, or something else that makes HomeStyle Decor the clear choice?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Excellent - curated design collections that create cohesive, sophisticated spaces without requiring design expertise. That's a strong differentiator for busy professionals who want polished results.

Your value proposition: "Thoughtfully curated collections for design-conscious professionals who want sophisticated, cohesive spaces without the guesswork."

With foundation complete, let's move to channels. Given your $50 CAC target and design-conscious audience, which channels are you currently using or considering? Are you thinking paid search, social media, display advertising, or other options?

Turn 10:
Perfect. Instagram and Pinterest are smart choices for visual collections, and the lukewarm Facebook results make sense - it's less design-focused.

For your curated collections targeting design-conscious professionals, I'd recommend this channel mix:

**Primary (60% - $450K):**
- Instagram/Meta (30% - $225K): Strong visual platform, excellent targeting for homeowners 30-55
- Pinterest (20% - $150K): High-intent home design audience, longer content lifespan
- Google Search (10% - $75K): Capture "home decor" and collection-specific searches

**Secondary (25% - $187K):**
- Google Display/YouTube (15% - $112K): Reach design enthusiasts across home/lifestyle content
- Programmatic Display (10% - $75K): Retargeting and lookalike expansion

**Testing (15% - $113K):**
- TikTok (10% - $75K): Growing home design community, younger homeowners
- Connected TV (5% - $38K): Premium reach during home/lifestyle programming

This prioritizes visual storytelling while maintaining search capture. The mix should efficiently reach your audience in target metros.

Does this channel allocation align with your thinking, or would you adjust any areas?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 12:
Smart start with GA and Northbeam. Multi-touch attribution will be crucial with your visual channel mix where customers often research on Pinterest/Instagram before converting via search.

For robust measurement, I recommend this framework:

**Primary KPIs:**
- Revenue per new customer ($300 target)
- Customer Acquisition Cost ($50 target)  
- 90-day repeat purchase rate (benchmark 25-35% for home decor)

**Secondary KPIs:**
- 12-month customer lifetime value
- Channel contribution (beyond last-click attribution)
- Geographic performance by metro

**Measurement priorities:**
1. Set up cohort tracking for LTV analysis
2. Implement view-through attribution for visual channels
3. Tag campaigns by collection type to see which designs drive highest value

**Monthly reviews:** CAC and revenue per customer by channel/geo
**Quarterly reviews:** LTV trends and budget reallocation

The key is understanding which channels drive not just initial $300 purchases, but customers who return for additional collections.

Does this measurement approach align with your growth objectives?

Turn 13:
Excellent! Your measurement framework is solid and will provide the insights needed to optimize both immediate performance and long-term customer value.

Now let's talk testing strategy. With your $113K testing budget (15% of total), what's your appetite for experimentation? Are you interested in testing new audience segments, creative formats, collection launches, or channel expansion beyond what we've outlined?

Turn 14:
Perfect testing mindset - strategic but growth-oriented. Here's how I'd structure your $113K testing budget:

**Creative Testing (60% - $68K):**
- Lifestyle video content showing space transformations ($35K)
- Collection styling guides and room reveals ($20K) 
- User-generated content from customer homes ($13K)

**Audience Expansion (30% - $34K):**
- Late 20s professionals (emerging homeowners) ($17K)
- Early 60s affluent (downsizing/vacation homes) ($17K)

**Channel/Format Testing (10% - $11K):**
- Instagram Reels for transformation content ($6K)
- Pinterest Idea Pins for styling guides ($5K)

**Testing timeline:** 
- Month 1-2: Creative format tests
- Month 3-4: Audience expansion  
- Month 5-6: Scale winners, test new concepts

Success criteria: Beat your $50 CAC baseline or show 20%+ higher LTV to justify higher acquisition costs.

This balances creative innovation with audience growth while maintaining disciplined measurement.

Ready to move to our final step - risk assessment?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 11:
Absolutely - channel performance flexibility is critical. Strong campaigns typically reallocate 20-30% of budget based on early results. We should plan quarterly reviews to shift spend toward top performers.

Now let's set up measurement. With your $300 revenue per customer target and channel mix, what's your current tracking setup? Do you have attribution tools, customer lifetime value tracking, or specific metrics you want to monitor beyond revenue per new customer?

Turn 16:
Perfect - you've identified the critical risks. Seasonal concentration and supply chain disruptions can significantly impact a furniture business.

Here's your complete media plan summary:

**Foundation:** 15,000 customers, $300 revenue each, $50 CAC target
**Geography:** Weighted toward SF Bay/NYC (40%), distributed across 7 metros
**Channels:** 60% visual (Instagram/Pinterest), 25% expansion, 15% testing
**Budget:** $750K with 10% contingency reserve
**Measurement:** Multi-touch attribution, LTV tracking, collection performance
**Testing:** Creative formats, audience expansion, new platforms
**Risk Mitigation:** Off-season collection development, supply chain backup plans

**Key Success Factors:**
- Tight audience targeting to hit aggressive $50 CAC
- Strong creative showcasing curated collections
- Flexible budget reallocation based on performance
- Proactive seasonal planning to reduce revenue volatility

You now have a comprehensive, data-driven plan that balances ambitious growth targets with realistic execution strategies. The plan addresses your core business needs while building sustainable competitive advantages through superior measurement and testing.

Ready to execute and drive those 15,000 high-value customers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 10: Risks

Turn 15:
Excellent. Let's identify the key risks that could impact your plan and build mitigation strategies:

**High-Impact Risks:**

**1. Aggressive CAC Target ($50 vs $60-120 market rate)**
- Risk: 67% efficiency improvement needed vs benchmarks
- Mitigation: Start with tightest audience segments, optimize creative aggressively first 60 days, have backup budget reallocation plan

**2. Attribution Complexity (Visual-to-Search Customer Journey)**
- Risk: Under-crediting Pinterest/Instagram influence, over-optimizing search
- Mitigation: Northbeam view-through windows, holdout tests, survey attribution studies

**3. Seasonal Concentration Risk**
- Risk: 40% of purchases in spring/holiday periods creates cash flow gaps
- Mitigation: Test year-round messaging, develop off-season collection launches

**Medium Risks:**
- iOS privacy changes affecting Meta targeting precision
- Supply chain delays impacting advertised collections
- Competitive pressure in target metros driving up CPMs

**Contingency Planning:**
- Reserve 10% budget ($75K) for mid-year reallocation
- Prepare audience expansion if core segments saturate
- Have creative refresh pipeline ready for performance drops

**Monthly risk reviews:** Track early warning signals like rising CPMs or declining repeat rates.

Any specific risks you're particularly concerned about given your business context?

Turn 17:
Excellent! You're ready to execute a strong plan. The combination of ambitious targets with disciplined measurement and built-in flexibility gives you the best chance for success.

For implementation timing, I'd recommend this sequence:

**Week 1-2:** Team kickoff and creative brief development
**Week 3-4:** Campaign setup and initial creative production  
**Week 5:** Soft launch with core audiences and channels
**Week 6+:** Full deployment with weekly optimization

The key will be that weekly optimization discipline you mentioned - especially the first 60 days when you're proving that $50 CAC target is achievable.

Your team should feel confident about this plan. You've built a data-driven strategy that leverages your strengths (curated design, strong margins, proven markets) while systematically addressing the challenges (aggressive efficiency targets, seasonal concentration).

Success comes down to execution now. Trust the measurement framework, stay flexible with budget allocation, and keep that customer lifetime value focus front and center.

You've got everything you need to acquire those 15,000 high-value customers. Go make it happen!

Turn 18:
Perfect! You're set up for success with a clear roadmap and the right mindset. 

The lifestyle video content and audience expansion tests should provide valuable insights for scaling beyond this initial plan. Remember to trust your measurement framework during those first few weeks - it'll guide you to the right optimizations.

Your team has a comprehensive strategy that balances ambitious growth with smart risk management. Execute with confidence, stay agile with your weekly reviews, and those 15,000 customers are absolutely achievable.

Best of luck with the kickoff meeting and launch. You've got this!
