# Media Plan Output: Aggressive KPI - Must Narrow to Achieve

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me validate your targets immediately. $750K ÷ 5,000 = $150 CAC exactly. At $2,400 LTV, that's a 16x ratio - excellent unit economics. Your $150 target is aggressive but achievable for B2B SaaS. Typical logistics software CAC runs $180-250, so you're targeting 17-40% better efficiency.

Your SMB logistics audience is well-defined. To hit $150 CAC with this precision targeting, we'll need tight channel efficiency and likely 2-3 primary channels max.

What specific business outcome is driving this 5,000 customer target - is this about hitting a revenue milestone, market share goal, or growth rate target?

Turn 2:
Perfect. $25M ARR target with 5,000 new customers at $2,400 LTV gets you $12M from this cohort - solid contribution to your board goal. Market penetration proof-of-concept for SMB logistics is a strong strategic objective.

Your primary KPI is new customer acquisition, measured at 5,000 customers. Let me assess the efficiency requirement: at $150 CAC vs typical $180-250 for logistics software, you need 17-40% better performance than market. This is aggressive but realistic given your underserved audience insight.

For SMB logistics stuck on spreadsheets, the pain point is real and urgent - that should drive strong conversion if we reach the right decision makers.

Your Step 1 outcomes are solid. Moving to economics - you mentioned $2,400 LTV. What's the timeframe on that LTV calculation, and do you have data on your current acquisition costs from any channels?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Let me update our efficiency analysis. Current performance shows $280 LinkedIn and $220 Google vs your $150 target. That means you need 46% improvement from LinkedIn and 32% from Google - significant but not impossible with better targeting and channel mix.

$2,400 LTV over 12 months is strong for B2B SaaS. At $150 CAC, you're looking at 5-month payback assuming even monthly revenue distribution. Your finance team's validation gives confidence in the unit economics foundation.

The gap between current $220-280 and target $150 suggests we need either: tighter audience precision, more efficient channels, or better conversion optimization. Your insight about underserved SMBs stuck on spreadsheets should help with conversion rates.

Step 2 economics check: the math works if we can hit efficiency targets. The 32-46% improvement requirement is aggressive but achievable with the right strategy.

Ready to move to audience definition - you mentioned SMB logistics managers at 50-500 employee companies. How are you currently defining and reaching these decision makers?

Turn 4:
Exactly right - broad targeting is likely driving your $280 LinkedIn CAC. For SMB logistics, you need surgical precision to hit $150.

Your current approach captures the right universe but lacks behavioral signals. Decision makers stuck on spreadsheets have specific digital footprints: they search for "logistics automation," "TMS software," visit competitor sites, engage with supply chain content, and likely show frustration signals around manual processes.

For 46% CAC improvement, consider layering:
- Job titles (your current approach)
- Company characteristics (revenue, employee count, industry verticals)
- Behavioral signals (content engagement, search behavior, competitor research)
- Technology stack signals (companies using basic tools vs enterprise TMS)
- Intent data (active software evaluation signals)

This creates much smaller, higher-intent audiences - potentially 50K-200K instead of millions.

How many logistics managers do you estimate exist in your target company profile, and are you seeing any patterns in which specific verticals or company types convert best from your current campaigns?

Turn 5:
Perfect data. 75,000 addressable logistics managers is an excellent foundation - large enough for scale but focused enough for precision targeting. Manufacturing and e-commerce showing stronger response makes strategic sense - these verticals have higher shipping complexity and urgency around logistics efficiency.

1-2% conversion rates confirm the targeting issue. For B2B SaaS with strong pain point relevance, you should see 3-5% conversion rates with proper audience precision. That improvement alone gets you closer to your $150 CAC target.

Your audience strategy should prioritize:
1. Manufacturing and e-commerce logistics managers first (proven higher intent)
2. Layer behavioral signals (software evaluation activity, pain point content engagement)
3. Company technology signals (basic tools vs no TMS)

This creates maybe 15K-25K highly qualified prospects instead of casting wide nets.

What geographic markets are you targeting - are you focused on specific regions, or is this a national campaign across all US markets?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Smart geographic focus. Tier 1 metros capturing 60-65% of your TAM with higher SMB density should drive better efficiency than national spread. Major metros like Chicago (manufacturing hub) and LA/SF (e-commerce corridor) align perfectly with your responsive verticals.

This geographic concentration strategy supports your $150 CAC target - you get:
- Higher audience density for better frequency management
- Localized competitive intelligence 
- More efficient media buying in established markets
- Easier sales team coverage for high-intent leads

Your 15K-25K precision audience across these metros creates manageable scale for testing and optimization.

Geography is locked. Now for budget reality check: $750K across Tier 1 markets for 5,000 customers. You mentioned current LinkedIn at $280 and Google at $220. 

What percentage of your $750K are you thinking for acquisition vs retention/expansion, and do you have flexibility to reallocate between channels based on performance?

Turn 8:
Strong value proposition - "strategic advantage" positioning elevates above typical software features. The 22% cost reduction is a concrete, measurable benefit that CFOs will approve. "Full-time specialist without the salary" directly addresses SMB budget constraints.

This messaging should significantly improve your 1-2% conversion rates. Pain-focused ("manual headache") plus outcome-focused ("strategic advantage") plus proof point (22% savings) creates compelling urgency for spreadsheet-trapped managers.

For Step 6 completion: your value prop clearly differentiates from basic TMS solutions and addresses both emotional pain (manual work frustration) and business impact (cost reduction, time savings).

Moving to channels - you mentioned 60/40 LinkedIn/Google Search starting split. Given your precision audience needs and $150 CAC target, should we explore adding a third channel like intent data platforms or account-based display to capture logistics managers actively researching TMS solutions?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Excellent approach. $675K acquisition budget with dynamic reallocation capability is exactly right for aggressive efficiency targets. Weekly performance tracking with budget flexibility gives you the agility needed to hit $150 CAC.

Let me model your starting allocation: $405K LinkedIn, $270K Google Search. At current performance ($280 LinkedIn, $220 Google), that projects to 2,670 customers - 47% short of your 5,000 target.

To hit 5,000 customers with your 60/40 split, you need LinkedIn at $162 CAC and Google at $108 CAC. That's 42% improvement on LinkedIn (achievable with precision targeting) but 51% improvement on Google (very aggressive).

This math suggests you'll likely need to shift budget toward whichever channel performs better, or add a third channel for efficiency.

Your value proposition for SMB logistics managers stuck on spreadsheets - what's your core message about why SwiftDeliver solves their manual logistics pain better than continuing with current tools or choosing competitors?

Turn 9:
Perfect strategic thinking. Intent data capture during active TMS evaluation should drive much higher conversion rates than broad targeting. G2/Capterra visitors are already in-market - that's premium intent.

Let me model a 15% test allocation: $100K intent-based, $345K LinkedIn, $230K Google. If intent data delivers $120-140 CAC (realistic for high-intent audiences), this could significantly improve your blended efficiency.

Your messaging alignment point is crucial - consistent "manual headache to strategic advantage" narrative across channels with channel-specific execution. LinkedIn focuses on peer validation, Google on immediate problem-solving, intent platforms on competitive differentiation.

Channel strategy locked: LinkedIn/Google foundation with intent data testing for efficiency optimization.

For measurement - beyond CAC tracking, what attribution model are you using to track the customer journey from first touch to closed deal? With B2B buying cycles, you'll need multi-touch attribution to optimize budget allocation effectively.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Exactly right - first-touch attribution is severely undervaluing your bottom-funnel performance. With 45-60 day cycles, you're missing critical conversion drivers and likely over-investing in top-funnel.

Weighted multi-touch with bottom-funnel emphasis will reveal intent platforms' true impact. G2/Capterra touches often convert at 5-10x higher rates than awareness touches but get zero credit in first-touch models.

Your measurement framework needs:
- Multi-touch attribution with bottom-funnel weighting
- SQL conversion tracking by channel
- Closed-won attribution with cycle analysis
- Weekly CAC monitoring for budget reallocation triggers

This measurement upgrade is critical for hitting $150 CAC - you'll likely discover Google Search and intent platforms deserve more budget than current allocation suggests.

For testing strategy - with aggressive efficiency targets, what's your approach for rapid optimization? Are you planning weekly budget shifts, creative testing cycles, or audience refinement based on early performance data?

Turn 11:
Aggressive testing framework matches your velocity mandate perfectly. Weekly optimization cycles with $200 CAC cut-off creates clear performance discipline. Real-time budget reallocation capability gives you the agility to capitalize on efficiency wins immediately.

Your 3-4 creative concepts per channel every two weeks ensures fresh messaging against audience fatigue - critical for LinkedIn where creative fatigue hits fast in B2B.

Testing strategy is solid. Final step - risk assessment. Your biggest risks are: 1) Intent data platforms may have limited scale vs your 5,000 target, 2) Multi-touch attribution transition could temporarily disrupt optimization, 3) Aggressive CAC targets may force premature audience narrowing that limits scale.

Which of these concerns you most, and what's your contingency if primary channels can't deliver the volume needed at $150 CAC?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 12:
Smart risk mitigation. Intent platform scale limits are real - G2/Capterra may only deliver 500-1,000 customers annually vs your 5,000 target. Facebook/Instagram and programmatic B2B display are logical expansion channels if precision targeting hits volume walls.

Your phased approach is exactly right: exhaust high-intent, surgical targeting first, then expand systematically. This prevents efficiency dilution while ensuring volume delivery.
