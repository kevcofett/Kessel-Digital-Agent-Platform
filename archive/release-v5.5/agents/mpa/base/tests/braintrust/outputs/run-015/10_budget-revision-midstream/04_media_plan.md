# Media Plan Output: Budget Revision Midstream

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business objective. You mentioned targeting 10,000 new customers - what specific business outcome is this campaign designed to achieve? Are you focused on overall growth, market expansion, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your objective is market share expansion in the mid-market B2B analytics space, targeting companies with 100-1000 employees.

Now for success measurement - you mentioned 10,000 new customers as your volume target. What's your primary KPI for measuring campaign success? Are you tracking new customer acquisitions, qualified leads that convert, or another specific metric?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Smart adjustment. Let me update our projections: 4,000 customers at 30% SQL conversion = 13,333 SQLs needed. At 20% MQL-to-SQL conversion = 66,667 MQLs required.

$500K budget / 66,667 MQLs = $7.50 cost per MQL.

That's much more realistic - still efficient at the lower end of B2B SaaS benchmarks ($25-75), which gives you room for optimization and learning.

With 4,000 customers at $2,400 LTV, you're projecting $9.6M in customer value from this $500K investment. Your implied customer acquisition cost is $125 ($500K / 4,000), giving you a strong 19:1 LTV to CAC ratio.

This efficiency target looks achievable for mid-market B2B SaaS. Ready to move on to defining your target audience?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it. Let me map this out: 10,000 customers at 30% SQL conversion = 33,333 SQLs needed. At 20% MQL-to-SQL conversion = 166,667 MQLs required.

$500K budget / 166,667 MQLs = $3 cost per MQL. 

This is extremely aggressive for B2B SaaS. Industry benchmarks typically show $25-75 cost per MQL for analytics software, and your target is 90% below that range.

With your $2,400 LTV, you have strong unit economics, but the volume target may need adjustment. To hit 10,000 customers efficiently, you'd likely need $1.2-2M budget, or target ~2,500-4,000 customers with current budget.

Which direction makes more sense - adjusting budget up or volume target down?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Great foundation with the 100-1000 employee range. To maximize MQL/SQL potential, we need to layer on behavioral and firmographic signals that indicate analytics readiness.

Let's start with job titles - who are the primary decision makers and influencers for analytics purchases at these companies? Are you typically selling to CMOs, heads of data, VPs of operations, or other specific roles?

Turn 6:
Perfect - heads of data, VPs of operations, and CTOs in mid-market tech and professional services. That's a strong foundation.

Now for industry refinement - you mentioned tech and professional services. Within tech, are there specific sub-segments that convert better? For example, are you seeing more success with SaaS companies, fintech, healthtech, or other verticals?

And for professional services, what types - consulting firms, agencies, legal, accounting, or others?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Excellent - B2B SaaS companies and management consulting firms with existing data infrastructure. These are high-intent segments that understand analytics value.

Now let's add behavioral signals. Beyond job titles and industries, what indicates a company is ready to buy? Are you looking for companies using specific tools, experiencing rapid growth, raising funding, or showing other signals that suggest analytics need?

Turn 8:
Perfect targeting criteria. Let me summarize your refined audience:

**Primary Targets:**
- B2B SaaS companies (100-1000 employees)
- Management consulting firms (100-1000 employees)

**Decision Makers:**
- Heads of Data
- VPs of Operations  
- CTOs

**Behavioral Signals:**
- Series A/B funding (recent)
- 50%+ YoY growth
- Using basic tools (Google Analytics, Mixpanel)
- Scaling data teams/making senior data hires

This is a highly qualified audience with strong purchase intent signals. The combination of growth stage, existing tool usage, and data team expansion creates a compelling upgrade narrative.

What geographic markets are you targeting? Are you focused on specific regions, countries, or going global from the start?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Excellent allocation. $350K for media with $150K for creative and enablement shows smart planning. Let me update our efficiency targets:

$350K media budget / 66,667 MQLs = $5.25 cost per MQL.

That's even more aggressive than our earlier $7.50 calculation, putting you at the very bottom of industry benchmarks. While your creative investment should help conversion rates, this efficiency target will require extremely precise targeting and channel selection.

For your value proposition targeting heads of data and VPs of operations - what's your core message about how CloudMetrics solves their specific pain points? Are you positioning around data consolidation, advanced analytics capabilities, or something else that resonates with these roles?

Turn 11:
Strong positioning - "enterprise-level insights without the complexity" speaks directly to mid-market pain points. The progression from reactive reporting to predictive analytics creates a clear upgrade path for companies outgrowing basic tools.

Now let's move to channels. With your $350K media budget, precise B2B audience, and aggressive $5.25 MQL target, channel selection will be critical.

Given your audience of heads of data and VPs of operations at Series A/B SaaS and consulting firms, what channels are you considering? Are you thinking LinkedIn, Google Search, industry publications, or other specific platforms to reach these decision makers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Smart approach - North America provides the deepest pool of your target segments. The US and Canadian markets have strong concentrations of Series A/B SaaS companies and established consulting firms.

Now let's validate your budget allocation. You have $500K total budget. How much of that is allocated to media spend versus other marketing activities? Are you planning to reserve budget for creative production, landing page development, sales enablement, or other campaign support?

Turn 13:
Smart approach - your "eliminating data fragmentation" value prop could drive exceptional performance with the right execution.

For ultra-tight targeting to hit that efficiency, I'd recommend starting with your highest-intent signals:
- Companies with recent Series A/B funding + 50%+ growth 
- Job title targeting (heads of data, VPs ops, CTOs)
- Company size 100-1000 employees
- Industry: B2B SaaS and management consulting

Your creative strategy should speak directly to the progression pain: "Outgrowing Google Analytics? Turn scattered data into predictive insights."

How will you measure campaign success beyond MQL volume? Are you planning to track MQL-to-SQL conversion rates by channel, sales cycle velocity, or other metrics to optimize performance?

Turn 14:
Excellent measurement approach. Tracking MQL-to-SQL rates by channel will reveal which platforms deliver higher-quality leads, not just volume.

For testing strategy - with your aggressive efficiency targets, you'll need rapid optimization. Are you planning to A/B test creative variations, audience segments, or both? 

Given LinkedIn's learning phase typically takes 2-3 weeks, I'd recommend starting with 3-4 tightly defined audience segments and testing different value prop angles. What's your timeline for launch, and how quickly do you need to see performance signals?

Turn 15:
Perfect timeline - February launch gives you solid Q1 performance data. Your three messaging angles (speed, cost, scalability) should resonate differently across your audience segments.

For risk management, let's identify potential failure modes. Your biggest risks are:

1. **Efficiency Risk:** $5.25 MQL target is 65% below benchmarks
2. **Learning Phase Risk:** LinkedIn needs 2-3 weeks before reliable optimization
3. **Budget Concentration Risk:** Heavy LinkedIn dependence

What's your contingency plan if LinkedIn MQLs come in at $15-20 instead of $5.25? Are you prepared to shift budget to Google Search, adjust volume targets, or request additional budget?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 12:
Smart channel prioritization. LinkedIn provides the precise professional targeting you need for heads of data and VPs of operations.

Let me model your channel allocation against that $5.25 MQL target:

**LinkedIn:** Typically runs $15-40 MQL for B2B SaaS
**Google Search:** Usually $8-25 MQL for analytics keywords  
**Industry Publications:** Often $20-50 MQL depending on publication

Your $5.25 target is significantly below all these benchmarks. Even Google Search at the low end would need 50%+ efficiency improvement.

To hit your target, you'll need either:
1. Exceptional creative performance and tight targeting
2. Budget reallocation (more toward lower-cost channels)
3. MQL volume adjustment

Which approach feels most realistic given your constraints?
