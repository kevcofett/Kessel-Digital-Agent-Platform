# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience with Different KPIs Per Segment

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build this multi-segment media plan with you. This is sophisticated - three distinct objectives with different measurement frameworks across a $4.5M budget. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks.

Your segment structure is smart - awareness, performance, and retention require completely different approaches. Let me start with Segment 2 (In-Market Lead Gen) since it has the clearest business outcome.

For your active shoppers targeting leads - what's your target lead volume? Are you thinking total leads across all dealerships, or do you have volume targets by brand/location?

Turn 2:
Got it. Let me model this to see if your target is realistic. 

3-4 leads per dealership daily = 36-48 leads per day across 12 locations = 1,080-1,440 leads monthly. Your Segment 2 budget is roughly 45% of $4.5M = $2.025M annually, or about $169K monthly.

$169K / 1,080 leads = $156 per lead
$169K / 1,440 leads = $117 per lead

For automotive, quality leads typically cost $80-200 depending on market and vehicle type. Your $117-156 range sits right in the sweet spot - realistic and achievable.

However, I need to understand what "qualified lead" means to you. Are we talking about form fills with contact info, or leads that actually show up for test drives? The economics change significantly based on lead quality definition.

What defines a qualified lead in your system?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Perfect - that's much more valuable than basic form fills. Let me recalculate based on actual test drive appointments.

If you need 1,080-1,440 test drives monthly and convert at 30% from form fill to show-up, you need 3,600-4,800 form fills monthly.

$169K / 3,600 = $47 per form fill
$169K / 4,800 = $35 per form fill

That's aggressive for auto. Quality automotive form fills typically run $60-120. At $35-47, you're targeting 40-50% below market benchmarks.

Two paths forward: either increase budget to $216-288K monthly for realistic efficiency, or accept 800-1,200 test drives monthly at market rates.

Before we decide, what's the business value of each test drive that shows up? What percentage close, and what's average gross profit per sale?

Turn 5:
Great insight - lead qualification is your efficiency lever here. Based on automotive best practices, add these screening elements:

**Pre-Form Qualification:**
- Purchase timeline: "When are you planning to purchase?" (Filter for 30-90 days)
- Trade-in status: "Do you have a vehicle to trade?" (Higher intent signal)
- Financing approach: "Will you be financing, leasing, or paying cash?"

**BDC Confirmation Call:**
- Credit comfort: "Have you been pre-approved for financing?"
- Specific appointment commitment: "Can you confirm Tuesday at 2pm works?"
- Current transportation: "What are you driving now, and what's prompting the change?"

This should improve your 30% show rate to 45-55%, bringing test drive cost to $145-178 - much closer to your $135 break-even.

Now let's establish realistic targets. At improved 50% show rate and $80 per form fill, you'd need $270K monthly budget for 1,080 test drives. That's $3.24M annually vs your $2.025M Segment 2 allocation.

Should we target 675 monthly test drives (achievable with your budget) or discuss reallocating budget between segments?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Excellent - that changes everything. At $616 potential value per test drive, your economics are strong.

$616 × 22% close rate = $135 gross profit per test drive

This means you can spend up to $135 to acquire each test drive and break even. Your current target of $117-156 per test drive (including the form fill cost) is actually conservative and profitable.

Let me reframe: at realistic $80 per form fill with 30% show rate, each test drive costs $267. That's double your break-even, making this segment unprofitable at current conversion rates.

The path forward is improving that 30% show rate. If you can get form-to-show rate to 60%, your test drive cost drops to $133 - right at break-even. Above 60% becomes profitable.

This suggests tighter audience targeting and better lead qualification rather than volume optimization. Does your current lead qualification process screen for purchase timeline and financing readiness before scheduling test drives?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Perfect - 675 monthly test drives at 50% show rate is both realistic and profitable. The pre-form qualification will be your biggest efficiency driver.

That completes your In-Market segment economics. Now let's tackle Segment 1 - Conquest Awareness. You allocated roughly 35% = $1.575M annually for shifting consideration among competitor vehicle owners.

For awareness campaigns, success is typically measured by brand lift, aided/unaided recall, or consideration shift rather than direct response metrics. 

What's your primary KPI for the conquest awareness segment? Are you tracking brand awareness studies, consideration surveys, or do you have a different success metric in mind?

Turn 7:
Got it - brand recall and consideration shift with a 2-3 year horizon. $1.575M annually gives you meaningful reach for awareness building.

For brand lift measurement, you'll want quarterly studies tracking aided/unaided recall and purchase consideration. Typical automotive brand lift studies cost $15-25K per wave, so budget roughly $80K annually for measurement.

That leaves $1.495M for media investment. To set realistic expectations: automotive awareness campaigns typically achieve 3-8 point brand lift over 6 months depending on market saturation and spend levels.

Before we model reach targets, I need to understand your geographic footprint. Are all 12 dealerships clustered in one metro area, or spread across multiple DMAs? This significantly impacts your media efficiency and reach planning.

Turn 8:
Excellent - concentrated geography is a major advantage for awareness efficiency. One top-15 DMA with 80% concentration lets you dominate share of voice rather than spreading thin across markets.

$1.495M in a single major DMA can generate substantial reach. For context, automotive awareness campaigns in top-15 markets typically achieve:
- 70-85% reach among target demos at this spend level
- 8-12 frequency over 6 months
- 4-7 point brand lift with sustained investment

The spillover to your two outlying locations is bonus coverage at no incremental cost.

Now for Segment 3 - Loyalty/Retention with 20% allocation = $900K annually. This targets existing customers for service, trade-ins, and lease renewals.

What's your current customer database size across all 12 dealerships? And what's the primary retention action you want to drive - service appointments, trade-in inquiries, or lease renewals?

Turn 9:
Strong foundation - 45,000 customers with clear improvement opportunity. At 52% service retention, you're retaining 23,400 customers annually. Moving to 65-70% means adding 5,850-8,100 service visits.

$900K budget / 45,000 customers = $20 per customer annually for retention marketing. That's realistic for automotive CRM - allows for multiple touchpoints across email, direct mail, and digital.

For trade-ins, customers with 3-4 year vehicles are prime targets. Roughly 25-30% of your database likely fits this profile = 11,250-13,500 prospects. Trade-in inquiries typically convert 15-25% to actual trades.

Before we move to audience definition, what's the average service ticket value? And do you currently track customer lifetime value or just focus on individual transaction values? This helps determine how aggressive we can be with retention spending.

Turn 10:
You're absolutely right - that's a significant opportunity. Let me model the LTV to show the retention economics.

At $385 average service ticket:
- Current 52% retention = $385 × 0.52 = $200 annual service value per customer
- Target 65% retention = $385 × 0.65 = $250 annual service value per customer

That's $50 incremental value per customer. With your $20 retention marketing spend, you'd generate 2.5x return just from service - before counting trade-ins, referrals, or repeat purchases.

Full automotive LTV including repeat purchases typically runs $3,000-8,000 depending on brand mix. Even conservative $4,000 LTV makes retention marketing extremely profitable.

This completes your economics foundation. All three segments show strong potential:
- In-Market: 675 monthly test drives, profitable with improved qualification
- Conquest: $1.495M for meaningful brand lift in concentrated DMA  
- Retention: 2.5x+ return on $20 per customer investment

Ready to move to audience definition? Let's start with your Conquest segment - those affluent suburban professionals and tech-savvy younger buyers driving competitor vehicles.

Turn 11:
Excellent - let's build precise conquest targeting. For affluent suburban professionals and tech-savvy younger buyers currently driving competitors, we can layer multiple signals:

**Demographic Foundation:**
- Age: 28-45 (tech-savvy) and 35-55 (affluent professionals)
- Income: $75K+ household income
- Geography: Suburban zip codes within your DMA

**Behavioral Signals:**
- Current vehicle ownership data (Polk/Experian): Driving BMW, Audi, Lexus, Acura
- Auto intender signals: Visited competitor websites, researched reviews
- Lifestyle: Premium brand affinity, technology adoption patterns

**Digital Footprint:**
- LinkedIn engagement (professional targeting)
- Tech publication readership
- Premium retailer purchase behavior

At $1.495M spend, you can afford 15-20 targeting signals for precision. Tighter targeting improves brand lift efficiency - better to reach 60% of perfect prospects than 85% of loose matches.

Which competitor brands are you most focused on conquesting? BMW/Audi luxury buyers versus Honda/Toyota reliability buyers require different messaging approaches.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 12:
Perfect targeting focus - BMW/Audi/Lexus owners aged 35-45 are high-value conquest prospects with clear motivations.

**Refined Audience Signals:**
- Vehicle ownership: BMW 3/5-Series, Audi A4/A6, Lexus ES/IS (entry-luxury upgraders)
- Professional markers: LinkedIn Premium, business travel patterns, tech industry employment
- Innovation signals: Early tech adopter behavior, smart home devices, premium app subscriptions
- Lifestyle: Upscale dining, fitness memberships, design-focused purchases

This audience likely represents 180,000-220,000 people in your DMA. At $1.495M spend, you can achieve 75-80% reach with 8-10 frequency over 6 months - strong enough for consideration shift.

The "distinctive alternative to standard luxury" positioning is smart. These buyers want differentiation, not just another German luxury badge.

Now let's define your In-Market audience for lead generation. You mentioned active shoppers on Autotrader and Cars.com. What specific vehicle categories and price points are you targeting for the 675 monthly test drives?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 13:
Excellent targeting - that $35K-$65K premium segment with tech-forward preferences gives clear audience definition.

**In-Market Audience Signals:**
- Active shopping: Recent visits to Autotrader, Cars.com, manufacturer websites
- Vehicle research: Model Y, X3/X5, Q5, NX/RX comparison shopping
- Price point: $35K-$65K financing/lease calculators
- Feature focus: Safety tech, connectivity, hybrid/EV research
- Geographic: Within 25-mile radius of your dealerships

**Qualification Layers:**
- Purchase timeline: 30-90 days (from pre-form screening)
- Credit indicators: Prime/near-prime financing behavior
- Trade-in signals: Current vehicle 3+ years old

This creates a highly qualified pool for your 675 monthly test drives. The tech-forward focus aligns perfectly with your improved lead qualification process.

For your Retention audience - 45,000 existing customers - what's the breakdown between service-due customers versus trade-in prospects? This affects messaging and timing strategies.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 14:
Perfect breakdown - that gives us clear targeting priorities.

**Retention Audience Segmentation:**
- Service-Due (27,000): Past due, 30-day window, 60-day approaching
- Trade-In Prime (18,000): 3-4 year ownership, high-mileage, lease expiring
- Cross-sell opportunities: Service customers approaching trade-in timing

At $20 per customer annually, you can afford 6-8 touchpoints across segments with different messaging cadences. Service-due gets immediate action focus, trade-ins get consideration nurturing.

This completes our audience foundation across all three segments. Now let's move to geography. You mentioned one primary top-15 DMA with 80% concentration. 

What's the specific market, and are there particular suburbs or zip codes that over-index for your target demographics? This helps optimize media placement and local relevance.
