Hi, I'm the Marketing Manager at HomeStyle Direct. We're an e-commerce company selling home goods. I need to build a media plan for Q1-Q2. We have a $400K budget and need to acquire 5,000 new customers. Our average customer LTV is $320. Can you help me put together a plan?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by modeling your economics. $400K ÷ 5,000 customers = $80 per customer acquisition cost. With $320 LTV, that's a 4:1 ratio - excellent for sustainable growth. Home goods typically runs $60-100 CAC, so you're targeting mid-range efficiency.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 5,000 new customers? Are you focused on revenue growth, market expansion, or something else?

TURN 2 (Step 1)

USER:
Revenue growth is definitely our primary goal. We want to expand our customer base and increase overall sales in the home décor market. Our current customers love our products, so we're looking to replicate that success with new customers in the 30-55 age range who are interested in refreshing their home spaces.

AGENT:
Perfect! Revenue growth through customer base expansion is clear. Let me confirm your success measurement: you're targeting 5,000 new customers at $80 CAC with $320 LTV for $1.6M in customer value.

I notice you mentioned the 30-55 age range interested in home refreshing. That's a solid starting point for Step 3. But first, let me validate your economics are realistic.

At $80 CAC with $320 LTV, you need a 25% efficiency rate ($80/$320). For home goods e-commerce, this is achievable - many brands hit 20-30% of LTV as acquisition cost. Your 4:1 ratio provides good margin for profitable growth.

Does your $320 LTV represent lifetime value over a specific period, like 12 months or 24 months? This helps me assess if your efficiency target accounts for payback timing.

TURN 3 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our LTV is based on a 24-month customer lifetime. We've tracked our repeat purchase behavior and found that customers typically make 3-4 purchases within that window. The $320 represents total revenue generated during that period, not just the first purchase. Our goal is to acquire customers who will continue to shop with us beyond their initial transaction.

AGENT:
Excellent - 24-month LTV with 3-4 repeat purchases shows strong customer retention. That $320 represents real relationship value, not just first transaction, which makes your $80 CAC target very realistic for sustainable growth.

Your economics are solid: 25% of LTV as acquisition cost with 24-month payback provides healthy cash flow. Home goods brands typically see this efficiency when targeting quality customers who value the category.

Now let's define your target audience precisely. You mentioned 30-55 age range interested in home refreshing. To build effective targeting, I need to understand your ideal customer better.

What specific behaviors or life situations typically drive someone to discover and purchase from HomeStyle Direct?

TURN 4 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We see a lot of our customers are in transitional life stages - like young professionals buying their first home, new parents wanting to create a comfortable space, or people who've recently moved and want to update their décor. They're typically looking for quality, design-forward pieces that aren't super expensive. Our customers value both style and functionality, and they're usually researching online before making a purchase. They want pieces that make their home feel more personalized and reflect their current lifestyle.

AGENT:
Perfect! Transitional life stages are powerful targeting signals - first-time homebuyers, new parents, and recent movers all have high purchase intent and immediate needs.

Your audience profile is clear: design-conscious consumers in transition who research before buying and value style-function balance. This gives us strong behavioral and life-event targeting options.

For targeting precision, I need to understand your geographic focus. Are you targeting nationally, or do you have specific regions, metro areas, or states that perform better for HomeStyle Direct?

TURN 5 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're currently nationwide, but we've seen stronger performance in urban and suburban areas - particularly in metropolitan regions like Seattle, Austin, Denver, and the Northeast corridor. These areas tend to have more young professionals and design-conscious consumers who match our target demographic. We don't have a super granular breakdown yet, but those markets seem to resonate most with our brand and product line.

AGENT:
Excellent - urban/suburban metros with design-conscious demographics align perfectly with your transitional life stage targeting. Seattle, Austin, Denver, and Northeast corridor are all strong markets for home goods with higher concentrations of your target audience.

Let me structure your geographic targeting with audience sizing. I'll model your top-performing DMAs plus a few additional metros that match your customer profile.

**GEOGRAPHIC TARGETING - DMA LEVEL**

| DMA | Total Population | Target Audience Size | Target Audience % |
|-----|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| New York | 7,450,000 | 820,000 | 11.0% |
| Boston | 2,380,000 | 285,000 | 12.0% |
| Washington DC | 2,470,000 | 295,000 | 11.9% |
| Seattle-Tacoma | 1,870,000 | 243,000 | 13.0% |
| Denver | 1,650,000 | 215,000 | 13.0% |
| Austin | 1,020,000 | 143,000 | 14.0% |
| Portland | 1,240,000 | 161,000 | 13.0% |
| **TOTAL** | **17,080,000** | **2,162,000** | **12.7%** |

This gives you 2.16M target audience across your strongest markets. At 5,000 customer target, you'd need 0.23% conversion from target audience - realistic for well-targeted campaigns.

Does this geographic focus make sense, or should we adjust the market selection?

USER:
This looks great! The markets you've selected match exactly where we've seen our strongest performance. I like how you've broken down the population and target audience sizes. The 0.23% conversion rate seems very achievable, especially since these are our most engaged markets. The only thing I might suggest is making sure we have slightly higher budget allocation for New York and Boston, since they represent such large portions of our target audience.

AGENT:
Perfect! Geographic allocation based on audience size and performance makes complete sense. Let me model your budget distribution with higher allocation to New York and Boston.

**BUDGET ALLOCATION BY GEOGRAPHY**

| DMA | Target Audience | Audience % | Budget Allocation | Per-Customer Target |
|-----|----------------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| New York | 820,000 | 37.9% | $160,000 (40%) | 2,000 customers |
| Boston | 285,000 | 13.2% | $60,000 (15%) | 750 customers |
| Washington DC | 295,000 | 13.6% | $48,000 (12%) | 600 customers |
| Seattle-Tacoma | 243,000 | 11.2% | $44,000 (11%) | 550 customers |
| Denver | 215,000 | 9.9% | $36,000 (9%) | 450 customers |
| Austin | 143,000 | 6.6% | $28,000 (7%) | 350 customers |
| Portland | 161,000 | 7.4% | $24,000 (6%) | 300 customers |
| **TOTAL** | **2,162,000** | **100%** | **$400,000** | **5,000** |

This gives you 55% of budget focused on your two largest markets while maintaining realistic efficiency targets across all DMAs.

Now let's develop your value proposition. Based on your transitional life stage audience, what key message resonates most: the design quality, the functionality, the affordability, or something else entirely?

USER:
I think our core value is really about helping people create spaces that feel authentically "them" - design-forward pieces that are both affordable and functional. We're not just selling furniture or décor, we're helping people express their personal style without breaking the bank. Our customers want pieces that look great but also make sense for their lifestyle - like a coffee table that's stylish but can handle kids and pets, or a sectional that looks modern but is actually really comfortable. It's about making home design accessible and personal.

AGENT:
Excellent! "Authentically you" positioning with accessible design is powerful - it speaks directly to your transitional audience's desire for self-expression during life changes.

**VALUE PROPOSITION FRAMEWORK**

**Core Promise:** Transform your space to reflect who you are  
**Functional Benefit:** Design-forward pieces that work with real life  
**Emotional Benefit:** Home that feels authentically yours  
**Proof Points:** Stylish yet kid/pet-friendly, modern comfort, accessible pricing

This resonates perfectly with first-time homeowners wanting to establish identity, new parents needing functional beauty, and recent movers creating fresh starts.

**MESSAGING BY AUDIENCE SEGMENT**
- First-time buyers: "Make it yours from day one"
- New parents: "Beautiful spaces that work with family life" 
- Recent movers: "Fresh start, fresh style"

Your value prop is strong and differentiated. Now let's build your channel strategy. With $400K budget, transitional life stage targeting, and metro focus, we need channels that reach people actively researching home solutions.

What channels are you currently using, and which have performed best for customer acquisition?

TURN 8 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We've been primarily using Meta and Pinterest for our digital advertising, with some Google Shopping campaigns. Pinterest has actually been our strongest performer - it seems to really resonate with our design-conscious audience who are actively researching and planning home updates. Meta has been okay, but the targeting on Pinterest feels more precise for our specific customer demographic. Google Shopping has driven some traffic, but the conversion rates haven't been as strong as we'd like.

AGENT:
Excellent insights! Pinterest performing strongest makes perfect sense - it's where your audience actively plans and researches home projects. Meta being "okay" suggests room for optimization, and Google Shopping underperforming likely means search strategy needs refinement.

**CURRENT CHANNEL PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT**
- Pinterest: Strong audience-channel fit for home planning behavior
- Meta: Decent reach but targeting could be tighter  
- Google Shopping: Traffic without conversion suggests intent mismatch

Based on your $400K budget and performance data, I recommend expanding your Pinterest investment while optimizing Meta targeting around life-stage signals. For Google, shifting from Shopping to Search campaigns targeting "living room ideas" and "home decor" queries could capture higher-intent traffic.

**PROPOSED CHANNEL MIX**
- Pinterest: 45% ($180K) - your proven performer
- Meta: 30% ($120K) - optimized for life transitions
- Google Search: 20% ($80K) - high-intent home decor queries  
- Testing budget: 5% ($20K) - TikTok or Connected TV pilots

Does this allocation align with your experience, or should we adjust based on what you've learned about channel performance?
