# Media Plan Output: Efficiency Shock

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by modeling your efficiency target. $750K ÷ 15,000 applications = $50 per application. With $2,800 LTV, that's a 56:1 LTV:CAC ratio - extremely strong for insurance where 10-20:1 is typical.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 15,000 applications - is this about market expansion, product mix shift, or overall growth?

Turn 2:
Perfect - accelerated growth in your policy portfolio with focus on 35-60 families. Let me refine the efficiency picture since this impacts feasibility.

Your $50 per application target is very aggressive for insurance. Industry benchmarks typically show $150-400 per qualified application depending on product mix. At your $50 target, you'd need exceptional conversion efficiency.

How many of those 15,000 applications typically convert to actual policies? This conversion rate is critical since your $2,800 LTV presumably reflects actual policyholders, not just applications.

Turn 4:
Based on insurance benchmarks, let me model realistic scenarios for 15,000 quality applications:

**Conservative scenario:** $200 per application = $3M budget
**Moderate scenario:** $150 per application = $2.25M budget  
**Aggressive scenario:** $100 per application = $1.5M budget

Your $750K budget implies $50 per application - that's 2-3x more efficient than even aggressive performance. While possible with exceptional targeting and creative, it requires everything to work perfectly.

At your current $750K, you'd more realistically generate 3,750-5,000 applications ($150-200 each), yielding 1,300-2,000 actual policies.

Given your growth objectives and leadership's efficiency focus, would you prefer to:
1. Model at $750K with realistic 3,750-5,000 application expectation, or
2. Present scenarios showing budget needed for 15,000 applications?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Let me update our projections. With 35-40% conversion, you're targeting 5,250-6,000 actual policies from 15,000 applications.

$750K ÷ 5,250 policies = $143 true cost per customer. With $2,800 LTV, that's a 19.6:1 ratio - much more realistic for insurance and well within industry benchmarks.

However, your $50 per application target remains aggressive. Insurance typically sees $150-400 per qualified application. At $50, you'd need 3-8x better efficiency than market average.

Is this $50 application cost a hard constraint from leadership, or can we model what budget would realistically achieve 15,000 quality applications?

Turn 5:
Excellent strategic approach. Let me model the realistic scenarios for 15,000 applications with efficiency levers:

**SCENARIO A: MODERATE EFFICIENCY ($150/application)**
- Budget needed: $2.25M
- Final policies: 5,250-6,000 
- True CAC: $375-428
- LTV:CAC ratio: 6.5-7.5:1 (strong for insurance)

**SCENARIO B: AGGRESSIVE EFFICIENCY ($100/application)**  
- Budget needed: $1.5M
- Final policies: 5,250-6,000
- True CAC: $250-286  
- LTV:CAC ratio: 9.8-11.2:1 (excellent)

**KEY EFFICIENCY LEVERS TO REACH $100/APPLICATION:**
1. **First-party data advantage** - Lookalikes from best customers (40-60% efficiency gain)
2. **Conversion rate optimization** - Moving from 35% to 50% conversion dramatically improves unit economics
3. **Precise audience targeting** - 35-60 families with life events (new home, marriage, children)

To hit aggressive efficiency, which of your current assets is strongest: customer data for lookalikes, conversion optimization capabilities, or audience insights about high-converting segments?

Turn 6:
Perfect - first-party data is your competitive advantage. With years of policyholder data, you can build highly precise lookalike audiences that typically outperform cold prospecting by 40-60%.

This positions you well for the $100/application aggressive scenario ($1.5M budget). Strong first-party lookalikes could bridge the efficiency gap from typical $150-200 down to your $100 target.

**Step 2 complete** - we've established realistic efficiency targets with your data advantage.

**Moving to Step 3: Audience Strategy**

For lookalike modeling, what signals identify your highest-value policyholders? Are you segmenting by policy type (life vs annuity), premium levels, retention rates, or demographic patterns? Understanding your best customer profile will determine how we structure the lookalike strategy.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Excellent segmentation. Life insurance policyholders at $250-500 monthly premiums are your golden audience - married professionals, $100-150K income, young families. These behavioral and financial signals create a strong lookalike foundation.

Let me model audience sizing: Married professionals aged 35-60 with household income $100-150K and children represent roughly 8-12% of the total adult population. In major metros, this could yield 2-5 million targetable households - sufficient scale for your 15,000 application goal.

**Key insight:** Your best customers have clear life-stage triggers (marriage, children, home purchase) that create insurance urgency. This timing element can dramatically improve conversion rates.

Beyond the core demographic profile, do you see patterns in life events or timing when your best customers typically purchase? For example, do they often buy within 2 years of marriage, after having children, or during specific career transitions?

Turn 8:
Perfect - those life event triggers are goldmines for targeting efficiency. New parents and first-time homebuyers are in active insurance consideration mode, which explains why they convert better.

**Targeting layers for maximum efficiency:**
1. **Base audience:** Married professionals, $100-150K income, ages 35-60
2. **Life event triggers:** Recent home purchases, new children (0-24 months)
3. **Lookalike modeling:** Based on your $250-500 premium policyholders
4. **Behavioral signals:** Career advancement, family expansion indicators

This multi-layered approach should drive you toward that aggressive $100/application target since you're reaching people during high-intent moments.

**Step 3 complete** - we have a precision audience strategy.

**Moving to Step 4: Geography**

Which geographic markets are you currently strongest in, and where do you see the biggest growth opportunities for these family-focused segments?

Turn 9:
Smart expansion strategy. Your traditional markets (Atlanta, Dallas, Chicago, Pacific Northwest) provide proven performance baselines, while growth markets (Austin, Denver, Research Triangle) offer high-potential professional family populations.

**Geographic efficiency considerations:**
- **Proven markets:** Lower risk, established brand recognition, predictable CACs
- **Growth markets:** Higher upside potential but may require 20-30% higher initial acquisition costs as you build awareness

For your $1.5M budget targeting 15,000 applications, we could allocate roughly:
- 60% ($900K) to proven markets: ~9,000 applications 
- 40% ($600K) to growth markets: ~6,000 applications

This balances performance certainty with expansion goals.

**Step 4 complete** - we have geographic strategy with risk balance.

**Moving to Step 5: Budget Allocation**

Should we structure the budget with geographic splits as outlined above, or do you prefer audience-based allocation (life events vs. lookalikes vs. cold prospecting)?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Excellent strategic thinking - audience density should drive geographic allocation, not just historical performance.

**Audience-Driven Geographic Allocation:**

**Tier 1 Markets (High Audience Density):** 50% = $750K
- Austin, Denver, Research Triangle, select Chicago/Atlanta suburbs
- Highest concentration of married professionals $100-150K with young families
- Target: 7,500 applications at ~$100 each

**Tier 2 Markets (Moderate Density):** 35% = $525K  
- Secondary metros in proven regions, expanding Pacific Northwest
- Good audience match but lower concentration
- Target: 5,250 applications at ~$100 each

**Tier 3 Markets (Lookalike Expansion):** 15% = $225K
- New markets identified through lookalike modeling
- Testing/learning budget for future scale
- Target: 2,250 applications at ~$100 each

This approach prioritizes audience quality while maintaining geographic diversification.

**Step 5 complete** - budget reflects audience-first strategy.

**Moving to Step 6: Value Proposition**

What messaging resonates most with your married professionals during those key life moments - protection focus, financial security, or family legacy themes?
