# Media Plan Output: Demographic Shift Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by calculating your target efficiency: $1.5M ÷ 100K customers = $15 per customer acquisition cost. With $350 LTV, that's a 23.3x LTV:CAC ratio - extremely strong for streetwear where typical ratios run 3-5x.

This efficiency target is very aggressive. Based on Knowledge Base benchmarks, streetwear CAC typically runs $25-50. At $15, you're targeting 40-70% better efficiency than market typical.

To hit this ambitious target, we'll need precise audience definition and high-performing channel mix. What specific business outcome is driving this 100K customer goal?

Turn 2:
Perfect - aggressive growth for market positioning and funding momentum. That's a clear business outcome.

Your primary success metric is 100K new customers at $15 CAC. Given your $350 LTV, you have strong unit economics if we can achieve that efficiency.

Let me assess the feasibility: At $15 CAC vs. streetwear benchmarks of $25-50, you're targeting 40-70% better efficiency than typical. This is ambitious but achievable with precise targeting and channel optimization. High-growth streetwear brands hitting this efficiency usually focus on owned audiences, strong creative, and performance-driven channels.

Your LTV:CAC ratio of 23.3x gives significant room for scaling - most investors look for 3x minimum, so you're well-positioned there.

Is customer acquisition your only key performance indicator, or do you have secondary metrics like brand awareness or repeat purchase rate that matter for the funding story?

Turn 4:
Perfect - that's a much sharper profile. Urban professionals in creative fields who are sneakerheads and follow streetwear influencers. The lifestyle curation angle is key for messaging.

This audience typically has higher engagement rates and conversion potential, which helps explain how you might hit that aggressive $15 CAC. Creative professionals in tech/marketing/media also tend to have the disposable income to support your $350 LTV.

A few audience refinement questions to nail the targeting:

Are there specific income thresholds that correlate with your best customers - like household income above $75K or $100K?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent. Primary KPI is 100K new customers at $15 CAC, with repeat purchase rate as your secondary metric for investor validation. That combination proves both acquisition efficiency and customer quality.

Your economics are solid if we hit the efficiency target. $1.5M budget ÷ 100K customers = $15 CAC against $350 LTV creates a 23.3x ratio - exceptional for streetwear and compelling for investors.

The challenge: $15 CAC is 40-70% more efficient than typical streetwear benchmarks of $25-50. To achieve this, we'll need tight audience precision and high-converting channels. The good news is your strong LTV gives room to test and optimize.

Now let's define your audience more precisely. You mentioned Millennials 25-40 interested in streetwear. Within that broad group, what specific behaviors or characteristics define your highest-value customers?

Turn 6:
Perfect - NYC, LA, SF, and Chicago are ideal for your profile. SF's tech professional responsiveness and NYC as your brand's spiritual home creates strong geographic focus.

These four metros represent roughly 25% of your total addressable audience but likely 40-50% of your highest-converting prospects. Concentrating budget in proven markets should help hit that aggressive $15 CAC target.

Your audience is well-defined: Millennials 25-40, $85K-$120K income, creative professionals, sneaker culture enthusiasts, concentrated in NYC/LA/SF/Chicago. Estimated 600K-800K targetable individuals in these four markets.

Now let's talk budget allocation. With $1.5M total budget, how are you thinking about geographic distribution? Should we weight heavily toward your top-performing markets, or do you want to maintain presence across all 25 DMAs?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Excellent - $85K-$120K household income is a precise signal that will improve targeting efficiency. That income range captures professionals with discretionary spending power who still value streetwear culture authenticity.

Now let's size this audience in your top 25 DMAs. Your target profile: Millennials 25-40, household income $85K-$120K, urban professionals in creative fields, sneaker/streetwear culture participants.

Based on demographic data, this typically represents 8-12% of the total millennial population in major metro areas. In top 25 DMAs, that projects to roughly 2-3 million targetable individuals.

With 100K customer target from ~2.5M addressable audience, you're looking at 4% market penetration - aggressive but achievable for a well-executed campaign.

Which specific DMAs are you prioritizing within your top 25? Are you thinking major metros like NYC, LA, Chicago, or do you have data showing stronger performance in certain markets?

Turn 8:
Excellent - "wearable art" and "collectible pieces" positions you above commodity streetwear. The artist collaboration angle creates exclusivity and cultural relevance that justifies premium pricing and drives urgency.

This value proposition is perfect for your creative professional audience who want to stand out and curate unique aesthetics. The limited-edition model creates FOMO and repeat engagement - customers will follow your drops rather than just making one-time purchases.

For your $1.5M budget with 70/30 geographic split, this positioning supports your aggressive $15 CAC target. Limited drops create higher conversion rates and the collectible nature drives word-of-mouth, reducing acquisition costs.

Your repeat purchase tracking becomes even more important - customers collecting your drops should show strong lifetime value patterns.

Now let's build your channel strategy. Given your audience (creative professionals on Instagram following streetwear influencers) and value proposition (limited art drops), which channels are you currently using or considering?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Smart allocation - 70/30 split leverages your proven performance. $1.05M to your core four markets and $450K across remaining DMAs.

Let me calculate the efficiency implications:
- Core markets: $1.05M ÷ 70K customers = $15 CAC target
- Other DMAs: $450K ÷ 30K customers = $15 CAC target

Since your core markets show higher conversion rates, you might actually achieve sub-$15 CAC there, giving you buffer for the remaining markets where efficiency may be closer to $18-20.

This geographic focus should help hit your aggressive efficiency target. Concentrating spend in proven markets with dense target audience reduces waste and improves optimization speed.

Your value proposition needs to resonate with urban creative professionals who curate lifestyle aesthetics. What makes UrbanStyle different from other streetwear brands competing for this same audience?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Great foundation - Instagram as your primary channel makes perfect sense for your audience. Streetwear influencers on Instagram have authentic reach to your creative professional targets.

Let me model your current approach: If Instagram is driving most acquisition at your current scale, you'll need to significantly expand reach to hit 100K customers. Instagram alone typically caps at 20-30K new customers annually for brands your size without saturation.

For $1.5M budget targeting 100K customers, I'd recommend this channel mix:
- Instagram/Meta: 45% ($675K) - your proven performer
- Influencer partnerships: 25% ($375K) - leverages your artist collaboration brand
- Programmatic retargeting: 15% ($225K) - captures consideration from other touchpoints  
- TikTok: 10% ($150K) - test expansion to younger creatives
- Search: 5% ($75K) - capture brand demand from awareness efforts

This diversification helps avoid audience saturation while maintaining focus on visual, culture-driven channels that fit your wearable art positioning.

Does this channel allocation align with your thinking, or do you see different priorities?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Perfect - increasing influencer investment makes total sense given your artist collaboration model. Let's adjust to 50% Instagram ($750K), 30% influencer partnerships ($450K), keeping the rest as planned. That gives you $450K to amplify your core brand story through authentic creator voices.

This allocation leverages your strengths: visual storytelling, cultural credibility, and the limited-drop excitement that influencers can amplify to their engaged audiences.

Now for measurement. With your aggressive $15 CAC target and investor focus, you'll need precise tracking. Your primary metrics are customer acquisition cost and repeat purchase rate.

Key measurement considerations:
- Instagram/Meta attribution can be inflated, so we'll need incrementality testing
- Influencer ROI requires promo code tracking and brand lift studies  
- Cross-channel attribution to avoid double-counting customers
- Cohort analysis to track repeat purchase patterns for investor reporting

What measurement capabilities do you currently have in place, and what's your comfort level with incrementality testing to validate true channel performance?

Turn 12:
Perfect - 15% testing budget ($225K) shows strategic ambition while protecting your core efficiency targets. Twitch and design communities are smart directions that align with your creative professional audience.

**Testing allocation:**
- Emerging platforms (Twitch, design communities): $135K
- Creative format testing: $45K  
- New audience segments: $45K

This maintains your $15 CAC target across 85% of budget while giving room to discover channels that could drive your next growth phase.

Finally, let's identify key risks. Your biggest challenges:

**Risk 1:** Audience saturation in core markets could push CAC above $15
**Risk 2:** Influencer costs rising as streetwear competition increases
**Risk 3:** Attribution complexity making true performance unclear to investors

**Mitigation:** Geographic expansion ready if saturation hits, diversified creator tiers, robust incrementality testing from day one.

Your plan targets 100K customers at $15 CAC through proven Instagram/influencer strength, smart geographic focus, and investor-grade measurement. The testing budget provides upside discovery potential.

Ready to move forward with this strategy?

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 11:
Excellent - recognizing measurement gaps early is crucial. Your current setup captures direct attribution but misses incrementality, which is exactly what investors will scrutinize.

Here's your measurement upgrade plan:

**Primary Metrics:**
- Customer Acquisition Cost (validated through incrementality)
- Repeat Purchase Rate (cohort tracking)

**Implementation:**
- Geo-holdout tests for Instagram/Meta (split DMAs to measure true lift)
- Branded search lift studies to capture influencer halo effects
- Multi-touch attribution platform to reduce double-counting
- Cohort dashboards for investor reporting

**Timeline:** Start geo-holdouts in month 1, implement attribution platform by month 2, establish reporting cadence by month 3.

This measurement foundation will validate your $15 CAC target and provide investor-grade data on customer quality through repeat purchase tracking.

For testing strategy, what's your appetite for budget allocation to experimentation? Should we reserve 10-15% of budget for testing new audiences, creative approaches, or emerging channels?
