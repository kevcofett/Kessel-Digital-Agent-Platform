TURN 1 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Hi, I'm VP of Marketing at WealthPath Advisors, a wealth management firm. I need to build a media plan to generate 5,000 qualified leads with a $2M budget. Our target is high-net-worth individuals 55+ who are approaching or in retirement, with $1M+ in investable assets. LTV is around $15K per client. We focus on the top 30 wealth markets in the US.

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business outcome. You mentioned generating 5,000 qualified leads - what specific business result are you trying to achieve with those leads? For example, are you targeting a certain number of new clients, revenue goal, or AUM growth?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 2 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're targeting $75 million in new AUM this year. Those 5,000 leads should convert at about 2-3%, which would give us around 100-150 new high-net-worth clients. Our goal is steady, predictable growth in our wealth management practice.

AGENT:
Perfect. So your primary objective is $75M in new AUM through 100-150 new clients from 5,000 qualified leads. 

Let me calculate your efficiency targets: $2M budget ÷ 5,000 leads = $400 cost per lead. At 2.5% conversion (midpoint), that's $16,000 cost per client. With $15K LTV per client, you're targeting a 0.94 LTV/CAC ratio.

This is concerning - you'd lose money on each client acquisition. Wealth management typically needs 3-5x LTV/CAC ratios to be sustainable. At $15K LTV, your maximum viable cost per client is around $3,000-5,000, which means you'd need either:
- 75-80% lower acquisition costs, or  
- Higher client LTV than $15K

Is the $15K LTV first-year value, or does it include longer-term relationship value?

Events: calculation_performed, benchmark_cited, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 3 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
The $15K is first-year value, but we expect these clients to stay with us 7-10 years. Our total LTV is closer to $100K-$120K over the full relationship. So while the first-year economics look tight, our long-term client value is much stronger. We're comfortable investing in acquisition knowing the lifetime value is significantly higher than initial CAC.

AGENT:
Excellent - that changes everything. At $100K-120K LTV, your $16,000 cost per client gives you a healthy 6-7.5x LTV/CAC ratio. That's strong for wealth management where client relationships are long-term investments.

Let me validate the lead efficiency: $400 per qualified lead for high-net-worth prospects is aggressive but achievable in top wealth markets. Wealth management lead costs typically run $300-800 depending on qualification rigor and market competition.

Your 2-3% lead-to-client conversion rate seems conservative for qualified leads. Well-qualified HNW prospects often convert at 5-8% with proper nurturing. 

Are these leads pre-qualified for the $1M+ investable assets criteria, or does that qualification happen post-lead generation?

Events: benchmark_cited, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 4 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We pre-qualify based on some basic demographic and financial signals, but the full $1M+ verification happens during our sales qualification process. Our initial targeting uses proxy indicators like income levels, age, home value, and investment history to filter prospects before they enter our lead funnel.

AGENT:
Got it. So you're using proxy targeting upfront, then qualifying actual assets during sales. That explains the 2-3% conversion rate - some leads won't meet the $1M+ threshold upon deeper qualification.

This approach is sound. Your $400 cost per pre-qualified lead is realistic for HNW targeting using demographic and wealth proxies. The two-stage qualification (marketing signals + sales verification) is standard for wealth management.

Your economics look solid: $2M budget → 5,000 leads → 125 clients (using 2.5% midpoint) → $75M AUM at $110K average LTV gives you 6.9x LTV/CAC.

Now let's define your target audience precisely. You mentioned 55+ approaching retirement with wealth proxies. What specific demographic and behavioral signals will you use for your pre-qualification targeting?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 5 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're looking at households with $250K+ annual income, home values over $750K, retirement account balances above $500K, and professional backgrounds in executive, medical, and entrepreneurial roles. We want professionals who are within 5-10 years of retirement or recently retired, with strong investment literacy and a demonstrated history of financial planning. Our sweet spot is educated, professionally successful individuals who are sophisticated about wealth management but want expert guidance to optimize their retirement strategy.

AGENT:
Excellent targeting criteria. You've defined a sophisticated audience with clear wealth indicators and professional backgrounds that correlate strongly with $1M+ investable assets.

Let me size this audience in your top 30 wealth markets. Based on demographics, roughly 2-3% of households in major metros meet these combined criteria. In top wealth markets (NYC, SF, LA, Boston, DC, etc.), this translates to approximately 800K-1.2M households nationally.

This audience size supports your 5,000 lead target without oversaturation. The professional backgrounds (executives, doctors, entrepreneurs) are ideal for wealth management - they understand advisory value and have complex financial needs.

Your "sophisticated but seeking guidance" positioning is smart. These prospects aren't DIY investors but want expert optimization for retirement transition.

One strategic question: Are you prioritizing pre-retirees (5-10 years out) versus recent retirees? Pre-retirees have longer planning horizons but recent retirees often have more urgency and immediate assets to transfer.

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 6 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're actually targeting both segments, but with slightly different messaging. Pre-retirees get more forward-looking, strategic planning content about wealth preservation and retirement readiness. Recent retirees receive more immediate optimization and asset management messaging. We see them as complementary audiences with nuanced communication approaches, but both fit our core value proposition of sophisticated, personalized wealth guidance.

AGENT:
Smart dual-segment approach. Pre-retirees and recent retirees have different urgency levels but similar wealth profiles and advisory needs. The messaging differentiation makes sense - planning versus optimization.

Now for geography. You mentioned top 30 wealth markets. That's a broad footprint for a $2M budget. Wealth management performance varies dramatically by market due to competition density and local wealth concentration.

Tier 1 markets (NYC, SF, LA) have the highest HNW density but also the most competitive landscape and higher media costs. Tier 2 markets (Austin, Denver, Nashville) often provide better efficiency with strong wealth growth.

Are you planning equal allocation across all 30 markets, or will you weight investment toward your highest-opportunity markets? What's your current geographic presence or strength?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 7 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're currently strongest in California, Texas, and Florida - those three states represent about 60% of our existing AUM. For this media plan, we're thinking a weighted approach: 40% budget to those three states, then spreading the remainder across top wealth markets like New York, Massachusetts, and Washington. We want national presence but recognize efficiency varies by market. Our initial focus will be on markets where we already have brand recognition and referral networks.

AGENT:
Perfect allocation strategy. Concentrating 40% in your stronghold states (CA, TX, FL) leverages existing brand equity and referral networks. Those three states have massive HNW populations - California alone has ~400K households meeting your criteria.

Let me calculate your geographic budget split: 40% to CA/TX/FL = $800K, leaving $1.2M for national expansion across remaining markets.

This creates interesting efficiency dynamics. In your stronghold states, you should achieve better lead costs due to brand recognition and referral amplification. National markets will likely run 20-40% higher cost per lead initially but provide growth runway.

Your $800K across three large states gives substantial weight - roughly $265K per state. That's enough budget to achieve meaningful reach in major metros like LA, SF, Dallas, Houston, Miami.

What's your target budget allocation within those three stronghold states? Are you prioritizing specific metros or going state-wide?

Events: calculation_performed, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 8 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're targeting major metros within those states. In California, we'll focus heavily on San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles. In Texas, it's Dallas and Houston. In Florida, we're prioritizing Miami and Tampa. These metros represent about 70% of the state's high-net-worth population, so we'll concentrate our spend there rather than diluting across entire states. Our media mix will be precise - we want to hit financial districts, affluent suburbs, and professional networks in these key urban centers.

AGENT:
Excellent metro focus. Concentrating on SF/LA, Dallas/Houston, and Miami/Tampa captures the wealth density while maintaining targeting precision. These six metros have exceptional HNW concentration and established wealth management ecosystems.

Your $800K across six metros averages ~$133K per market - substantial enough for meaningful reach and frequency in each. Financial districts and affluent suburbs are smart geographic overlays for your professional targeting.

Now let's validate your overall budget structure. At $2M total:
- $800K for stronghold metros (6 markets)  
- $1.2M for national expansion (~24 markets)
- National markets average ~$50K each

The stronghold markets get 2.7x more investment per market, which aligns with your brand strength advantage. This should deliver better efficiency where you're known while building presence nationally.

Does this budget weighting feel right for your growth strategy, or would you adjust the stronghold versus expansion split?

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 9 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
The split looks good to me. We've been strategic about concentrating investment where we have the strongest brand presence while still maintaining a national footprint. The 40/60 split between stronghold and expansion markets gives us room to leverage existing networks and incrementally build our presence in new territories. I'm comfortable that this approach balances immediate lead generation efficiency with long-term market expansion goals.

AGENT:
Perfect. Your geographic strategy is solid - leveraging brand strength while building national presence. 

Now let's develop your value proposition messaging. You mentioned different approaches for pre-retirees versus recent retirees. For wealth management, the value prop often centers on expertise, personalization, and outcomes.

Given your sophisticated audience of executives, doctors, and entrepreneurs, what's your core differentiator? Are you positioning around specialized retirement transition expertise, comprehensive wealth preservation, personalized service, or investment performance? What makes WealthPath Advisors the right choice over competitors for this audience?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 10 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our core differentiator is holistic, proactive wealth optimization for sophisticated professionals. We're not just managing assets, but providing comprehensive life transition planning that goes beyond traditional investment management. What sets us apart is our ability to create customized, forward-looking strategies that integrate tax efficiency, estate planning, and lifestyle preservation - essentially acting as a true financial quarterback for high-net-worth individuals navigating complex retirement transitions.

AGENT:
Excellent positioning. "Financial quarterback" for complex retirement transitions is compelling for your sophisticated audience. It positions you beyond asset management into strategic life planning.

Your value prop hits key motivators for HNW professionals: holistic integration, proactive approach, and customized strategies. The tax efficiency and estate planning elements are crucial differentiators - these prospects have complex financial situations requiring coordination across multiple areas.

This messaging works well for both segments: pre-retirees need the forward-looking transition planning, recent retirees need the optimization and coordination expertise.

Now let's move to channels. With $2M budget targeting sophisticated professionals in major metros, you'll need a multi-channel approach. Wealth management typically combines digital precision targeting with high-credibility channels.

What channels are you currently using or considering? Are you thinking primarily digital, or do you want to include traditional channels like print, radio, or out-of-home in affluent areas?

Events: benchmark_cited, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 11 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're leaning heavily digital, but with strategic traditional media overlay. LinkedIn will be our primary channel for professional targeting, supplemented by precision programmatic display. We want Financial Times, Wall Street Journal digital, and targeted podcast sponsorships. For traditional media, we're considering business class airline lounges, select business publications like Bloomberg Magazine, and high-end out-of-home in financial districts. Our goal is to create an omnipresent, sophisticated media presence that feels curated, not mass market.

AGENT:
Excellent channel strategy. You've chosen high-credibility environments that align perfectly with your sophisticated audience and positioning.

LinkedIn is ideal for your executive/professional targeting. WSJ and FT digital provide financial context and credibility. Business class lounges and financial district OOH create premium touchpoints where your prospects actually spend time.

Let me model your channel allocation based on typical wealth management performance:

**Digital (70% = $1.4M):**
- LinkedIn: $600K (primary professional targeting)
- Programmatic display: $400K (retargeting and lookalikes)  
- WSJ/FT digital: $300K (contextual credibility)
- Podcast sponsorships: $100K (thought leadership positioning)

**Traditional (30% = $600K):**
- Business lounges: $250K (captive HNW audience)
- Business publications: $200K (Bloomberg, etc.)
- Financial district OOH: $150K (geographic precision)

This creates sophisticated frequency across multiple premium touchpoints. Does this allocation align with your vision, or would you adjust the digital/traditional split?

Events: calculation_performed, benchmark_cited, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 12 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
This looks phenomenal. The channel mix feels incredibly precise for our target audience - it's not just about reach, but about creating a curated, sophisticated brand presence where our prospects actually live and work. The LinkedIn investment is particularly strategic, and I love the thought of creating an omnipresent presence through these premium channels. The 70/30 digital/traditional split feels exactly right for our sophisticated approach. Let's move forward with this allocation.

AGENT:
Excellent. Your channel strategy creates sophisticated frequency across premium touchpoints where HNW professionals engage with financial content.

Now for measurement. With $2M investment and long-term client relationships, you need both performance metrics and brand tracking.

**Primary KPIs:**
- Cost per qualified lead (target: $400)
- Lead-to-client conversion rate (current: 2-3%)
- Cost per client acquisition (target: $16K)
- Pipeline velocity and qualification rates

**Secondary metrics:**
- Brand awareness in target markets
- Share of voice in wealth management
- Channel attribution and assist analysis
- LTV realization tracking over 7-10 years

Given your sophisticated audience and premium channels, how will you track attribution across touchpoints? Many HNW prospects research extensively before engaging, so you'll need multi-touch attribution to understand the full journey.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 13 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're implementing a robust multi-touch attribution model using our CRM and marketing automation platform. We'll track initial touchpoints from LinkedIn and digital channels, then map subsequent engagements across podcasts, digital publications, and our retargeting efforts. Our sales team will also log detailed interaction histories during qualification calls to understand the full prospect journey. The goal is to understand which channels and content types are most influential in driving high-quality leads, not just first or last click attribution.

AGENT:
Perfect attribution approach. Multi-touch modeling is essential for wealth management where prospects often have 6-12 touchpoints before engaging. Sales team logging during qualification calls is brilliant - they'll capture offline influences like referrals or traditional media that digital tracking misses.

Now let's plan your testing strategy. With $2M budget across multiple channels and two audience segments, you have significant testing opportunities.

**Priority tests:**
- Pre-retiree vs recent retiree messaging performance by channel
- Geographic efficiency: stronghold vs expansion markets  
- Creative approaches: thought leadership vs outcome-focused
- LinkedIn targeting: job title vs company size vs industry
- Attribution window optimization for long consideration cycles

Which testing priorities matter most to you? Given your sophisticated audience's longer consideration cycles, you'll need 60-90 day test windows to capture meaningful conversion data.
