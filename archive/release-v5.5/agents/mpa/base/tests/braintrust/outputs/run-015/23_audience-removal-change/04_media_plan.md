# Media Plan Output: Audience Removal Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start - you've given me substantial detail. Let me recalculate your efficiency target: $4M ÷ 15,000 test drives = $267 per test drive. For automotive, test drive costs typically run $150-400 depending on vehicle price point and market competition.

At $267, you're in the middle range, which is realistic for EV launches. This suggests a solid foundation for your plan.

To complete our outcomes framework: what specific business outcome are you ultimately driving toward with these 15,000 test drives?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 3:
Great detail on the eco-conscious segment. That profile - urban professionals in tech/sustainability with high social influence - suggests strong digital targeting opportunities and word-of-mouth potential.

Now for your luxury buyers 45-65 switching from German sedans - what drives their consideration of EVs? Are they motivated by performance, technology, environmental concerns, or something else? And what specific luxury behaviors or preferences should we know about?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Excellent. Let me model your conversion funnel: 4,750 sales from 15,000 test drives = 31.7% conversion rate. At $5,500 margin per sale, that's $26.1M in gross margin against your $4M investment - a 6.5x return.

Your 32% test drive conversion is aggressive but achievable for EVs with strong product-market fit. Tesla historically sees 25-35% in this range.

However, let me flag a key consideration: $4M ÷ 4,750 sales = $842 customer acquisition cost. With $5,500 margin, your LTV:CAC ratio is 6.5x - very healthy and sustainable.

Your economics look solid. The critical success factor will be that 32% test drive conversion rate, which depends heavily on product experience, sales process, and inventory availability.

Now let's dive deeper into your three audience segments. Starting with your eco-conscious early adopters 25-45 - what specific behaviors or characteristics define this group beyond age and environmental values?

Turn 4:
Perfect - performance and status over environmental benefits for this segment. That's crucial for messaging and channel selection.

For your tech enthusiasts focused on features - what specific technologies or capabilities are most important to them? Are we talking about autonomous driving features, software integration, performance specs, or something else? And how do they typically research and evaluate tech products?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Excellent - tech enthusiasts as mobile platform buyers who research deeply through forums and technical content. That's a very different engagement pattern from your other segments.

Now let's move to geography. You mentioned California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Washington. These states vary significantly in EV adoption rates and infrastructure. 

Which specific metro areas within these states are you prioritizing? For example, in California are you focusing on LA, SF Bay Area, San Diego - or broader coverage?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Perfect metro targeting - those markets have strong EV infrastructure and high concentrations of your segments. SF Bay/Silicon Valley particularly aligns well with both tech enthusiasts and eco-conscious professionals.

Now let's validate your budget allocation. You have $4M total. How are you thinking about distributing this across your five states, or do you want to model based on market potential and segment concentration?

For reference, California typically commands 35-45% of EV marketing budgets due to market size and adoption rates, while your other metros would scale accordingly.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Let me model your proposed allocation: California 42.5% = $1.7M, New York 20% = $800K, Texas 15% = $600K, Washington 10% = $400K, Florida 10% = $400K.

At 15,000 total test drives, this breaks down to:
- California: 6,375 test drives at $267 each
- New York: 3,000 test drives at $267 each  
- Texas: 2,250 test drives at $267 each
- Washington: 1,500 test drives at $267 each
- Florida: 1,500 test drives at $267 each

Your allocation aligns well with EV market maturity - California's infrastructure and adoption rates support that 42.5% investment. The efficiency target of $267 per test drive should be achievable across all these metros given their affluent demographics.

Now let's develop your value proposition. With three distinct segments, you'll likely need differentiated messaging. What's your core brand positioning that ties all three segments together before we customize for each?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
Excellent unified positioning - "sophisticated high-performance technology platform" works across all three segments while allowing customization.

Let me suggest how this translates for each segment:

**Eco-conscious professionals**: "Intelligent sustainability" - advanced tech that happens to be zero-emission
**Luxury buyers**: "Next-generation prestige" - performance and status evolution from traditional luxury
**Tech enthusiasts**: "Mobile innovation platform" - cutting-edge tech that happens to be a vehicle

This messaging hierarchy lets you lead with technology and performance while making environmental benefits a natural outcome rather than the primary sell.

Now for channels - given your three distinct segments with different media consumption patterns, what's your initial thinking on channel mix? Your tech enthusiasts live in forums and YouTube, luxury buyers likely consume different media, and eco-conscious professionals have their own patterns.

Turn 9:
Strong channel thinking that maps well to segment behaviors. Your approach recognizes that tech enthusiasts need deep content (YouTube reviews, Reddit), luxury buyers expect premium environments (Robb Report, premium streaming), and eco-conscious professionals engage through values-aligned content.

Let me model your efficiency requirements by channel type:

**High-engagement channels** (YouTube tech reviews, Reddit AMAs): Likely $150-250 per test drive
**Premium placements** (Robb Report, luxury streaming): Expect $300-500 per test drive  
**Social/programmatic** (Instagram, LinkedIn, display): Typically $200-350 per test drive

Your blended $267 target suggests you'll need roughly 60% efficient channels, 40% premium to hit overall efficiency.

For measurement, how are you planning to track test drive attribution across these diverse touchpoints? And what's your current capability for connecting test drives back to media exposure?

Turn 10:
That's honest and common - most automotive brands struggle with attribution complexity. Your current UTM approach gives you last-click insights but misses the customer journey.

For EV launches, I'd recommend implementing:
**Immediate**: Enhanced UTM tracking with campaign/segment/creative parameters
**Month 1**: Customer survey at test drive ("How did you first hear about us?")
**Month 2**: Media mix modeling to understand channel contribution
**Month 3**: First-party data integration for lookalike development

Given your $267 efficiency target, even basic attribution improvements could unlock 15-25% better performance by identifying and scaling your best-performing touchpoints.

Now let's address testing strategy. With three segments and multiple channels, what's your approach for testing creative messaging and channel performance? Are you planning structured A/B tests or more exploratory learning?

Turn 11:
Excellent systematic approach. Your three-variant testing (performance/sustainability/technology) will reveal which messaging resonates most with each segment across channels.

For test structure, I recommend:
**Week 1-2**: 20% budget for testing across all segments/channels
**Week 3-4**: Analyze performance and double down on winning combinations  
**Week 5-8**: Scale winners while testing secondary variables (creative formats, audiences)

Given your $4M budget, allocating $800K to structured testing could improve your overall efficiency by 20-30%, easily paying for itself.

Finally, let's address risks. What concerns you most about this launch - competition, market timing, operational capacity, or something else? Understanding your biggest risks helps us build contingencies into the plan.

Turn 12:
Valid concerns - Tesla's brand dominance and operational execution are real competitive moats. Your $267 efficiency target becomes more challenging when competing against established players with strong organic demand.

Key risk mitigation strategies:
**Competition**: Emphasize your differentiation in messaging - avoid direct Tesla comparisons, focus on unique value props
**Operational capacity**: Build test drive availability buffers - target 20% more capacity than projected demand
**Inventory/supply**: Develop clear communication strategy for wait times and delivery expectations upfront

Given these risks, consider allocating 10-15% of budget ($400-600K) to rapid response capabilities - additional inventory for hot markets or accelerated creative production if competitive messaging shifts.

We've covered all ten areas. You have a solid foundation: realistic economics, well-defined segments, appropriate geographic focus, and systematic testing approach. Your main execution focus should be operational readiness to match your marketing investment.
