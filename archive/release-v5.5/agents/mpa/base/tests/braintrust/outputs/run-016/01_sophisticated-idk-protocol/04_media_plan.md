# Media Plan Output: Sophisticated User - IDK Protocol

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start - you want 10,000 new users with $500K spend. That's $50 per user acquisition cost. For remittance fintech, this is aggressive but achievable with tight execution - typical CAC runs $60-100 in this vertical.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 10,000 users? Are you focused on transaction volume, revenue growth, or market share expansion?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Excellent - revenue growth through higher-value users is a strong strategic focus. Let me update our efficiency target.

For remittance, assuming 2-3% transaction fees, you'd need users averaging $1,667-2,500 in monthly volume to justify $50 CAC. That's achievable with your target of professionals and first-generation immigrants.

How do you define success numerically? What's your primary KPI - total transaction volume, revenue per user, or something else? And what's your specific target number for this quarter?
