# Media Plan Output: Basic User - Steps 1-2 Completion

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What business outcome are you trying to achieve? For example, are you looking to get more customers, increase sales from existing customers, or launch a new shoe line?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Growing your customer base is a clear objective. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success.

What specific number would show you're winning? For example, are you targeting a certain number of new customers, a sales revenue goal, or something else measurable?

Turn 4:
Let me update our projections. $250,000 ÷ 500 customers = $500 per customer. 

That's quite generous for shoe retail, where cost per customer typically runs $50-80. This gives you excellent flexibility - you could either target many more customers with that budget, or invest heavily in premium channels to build strong brand awareness.

To make sure this works, what's a typical shoe sale worth to you? For example, if someone buys a pair of shoes, what do you usually make in profit?

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 5:
Perfect. For shoe retailers, profit margins typically run 40-50%. Let me model at $55 profit per sale. You can adjust anytime.

Here's what this means: at $500 per customer and $55 profit per sale, you'd need each customer to buy about 9 pairs of shoes to break even. That's quite high for most shoe businesses, where customers typically buy 1-2 pairs initially.

This suggests either targeting many more customers with your budget, or focusing on building long-term customer relationships. Do your customers typically come back and buy multiple pairs over time, or are most purchases one-time?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it. For shoe retailers, 500 new customers annually is a solid starting goal. Let me model at 500 customers and you can adjust anytime.

What's your budget for getting those 500 new customers? This helps us figure out how much you can spend per customer and if that's realistic for the shoe business.
