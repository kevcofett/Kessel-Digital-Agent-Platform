# Media Plan Output: Brand Building with Limited Data

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

For your West Coast launch, I need to understand your primary business outcome. When you say "build brand awareness," what specific business result are you trying to achieve - are you looking to drive direct sales, generate leads for your products, or establish market presence for future growth?

Turn 2:
Perfect - direct sales with brand building for health-conscious millennials and Gen Z. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success.

What's your target number for this first cohort of customers? Are you aiming for a specific customer count, or do you have a revenue target in mind for this West Coast launch?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it. I'll model using 2,500 customers as your target - you can adjust anytime. 

$500K / 2,500 = $200 per customer. For natural supplements, cost per customer typically runs $75-150 based on industry benchmarks. At $200, you're targeting about 33-167% above typical efficiency.

This suggests either tighter targeting will be critical, or you might need around $190K-375K to hit 2,500 customers at market rates. Since this is brand building in a new market, the higher cost could make sense for initial awareness investment.

What's the average order value for your wellness products?

Turn 4:
Let me update the projections. With $85 average order value (midpoint) and $200 cost per customer, you'd need customers to purchase 2.4 times to break even. 

For supplement brands, first-year customer value typically runs 1.5-2.5x the initial order, so your target efficiency is achievable but requires strong retention and repeat purchase rates.

At 2,500 customers × $85 = $212K in first-order revenue against $500K spend. This means you're investing heavily in brand building and customer acquisition, betting on lifetime value.

Do you have data on repeat purchase rates from your existing markets, or should I model using supplement industry benchmarks of 35-45% repeat rate?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Perfect. I'll model at 40% repeat rate with industry benchmarks. This gives you a realistic efficiency target to work toward.

Now let's move to Step 3 - defining your audience. You mentioned health-conscious millennials and Gen Z. To build precise targeting, I need more specifics.

What age range are you focusing on within millennials and Gen Z - are you targeting 22-40, or a tighter range within that group?

Turn 6:
Great - 25-40 year olds who are wellness-focused professionals with disposable income. To build targeting precision, I need to understand their behaviors and interests beyond demographics.

What specific wellness behaviors or lifestyle signals would identify your ideal customer - are they yoga practitioners, fitness enthusiasts, organic food shoppers, meditation app users, or something else that indicates their commitment to natural wellness?

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Excellent targeting signals. Your audience is clearly defined: 25-40, wellness lifestyle adopters who track fitness/nutrition, follow wellness influencers, shop premium organic, and use health apps.

Now for Step 4 - geography. You mentioned California, Oregon, and Washington. 

Are you planning to target all major metros equally across these three states, or do you want to focus on specific cities like LA, SF, Seattle, Portland first?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Perfect - SF, LA, Seattle, and Portland as your priority metros. These are ideal for wellness brands with strong millennial/Gen Z populations.

Moving to Step 5 - budget allocation. With your $500K across four major metros, we need to consider market size and opportunity.

LA is the largest market, followed by SF Bay Area, Seattle, then Portland. Would you prefer to weight your budget by market size, or allocate more evenly to test which metros respond best to your brand?

Turn 9:
Excellent allocation strategy - weighted by market size but with meaningful investment in all metros for learning. That gives us:

- LA: $175K (35%)
- SF: $150K (30%) 
- Seattle: $100K (20%)
- Portland: $75K (15%)

This provides enough budget per metro to reach your wellness audience effectively while allowing performance comparison across markets.

Now for Step 6 - your value proposition. For health-conscious millennials and Gen Z who prioritize natural wellness, what makes GreenLeaf different from other supplement brands they might consider?

Turn 10:
Perfect value proposition - transparency, sustainability, and environmental consciousness align perfectly with your target audience's values. The supply chain transparency is particularly compelling for wellness-focused consumers.

Moving to Step 7 - channels. For your wellness-focused millennials/Gen Z in these metros, several channels could work effectively.

Given your brand-building goals, transparency message, and need to reach health-conscious audiences, what's your comfort level with social platforms where wellness influencers are active, versus search-based channels where people are actively researching supplements?
