TURN 1 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I'm the Director of Performance Marketing at LuxeFinance, a wealth management firm. We need to build a precision media plan to acquire high-net-worth individuals - specifically people with $1M+ in investable assets, typically 45-65, executives and business owners who are either approaching retirement or have a major liquidity event coming up. We're interested in people researching tax optimization and estate planning. Budget is $1.5M, targeting 2,500 qualified leads. We have CRM data on 50K existing clients we can use for modeling. Focus on top DMAs by HNW concentration - NYC, SF, LA, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Denver, Miami, Dallas, DC. Quality matters more than volume here.

AGENT:
Hi! I am excited to build a media plan with you. We will cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start - you've provided excellent context on your HNW target and geographic focus. Let me clarify your primary business outcome: Are you optimizing for qualified leads that convert to AUM, or is there a specific revenue target tied to these 2,500 leads?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 2 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our primary goal is converting qualified leads to AUM. We know these HNW prospects have high lifetime value, so we're focused on SQLs that have a high probability of becoming clients. While we don't have an exact revenue target yet, we're targeting leads that could potentially bring $10-20M in new investable assets per quarter.

AGENT:
Excellent. Let me update our projections. $1.5M / 2,500 leads = $600 per qualified lead. For HNW wealth management, industry benchmarks typically run $400-800 per SQL, so you're positioned well within realistic range.

With your 50K client CRM data for lookalike modeling and focus on quality over volume, this efficiency target is achievable. HNW targeting naturally commands premium CPMs but delivers higher conversion rates.

Now for your unit economics: What's your typical conversion rate from SQL to client, and what's the average AUM per new HNW client relationship?

Events: calculation_performed, benchmark_cited, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 3 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our historical data shows about a 15-20% conversion rate from SQL to client, which is solid for our segment. Average AUM per new client relationship is around $15-18M, but we're still refining those metrics. Our first-party data suggests we can improve those numbers with more precise targeting.

AGENT:
Perfect. At 17.5% average conversion rate, your 2,500 SQLs should yield ~440 new clients. With $16.5M average AUM at 1% management fee, that's $165K annual revenue per client or $72.6M total annual revenue potential.

Your $600 cost per SQL against $165K annual client value creates exceptional unit economics - roughly 275:1 LTV to acquisition cost ratio. This gives you significant room for premium targeting and quality focus.

Your efficiency target is conservative for HNW wealth management, which validates prioritizing precision over volume. The 50K client lookalike foundation should drive strong performance.

Step 1 complete. Now let's define your high-net-worth audience precisely. Beyond the $1M+ investable assets and 45-65 age range, what specific behavioral or life-stage signals indicate someone is actively seeking wealth management services?

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 4 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our CRM data reveals key behavioral signals: executives researching retirement transitions, business owners exploring succession planning, and individuals experiencing major liquidity events like company acquisitions or IPO windfalls. We've seen strong intent from professionals searching for tax optimization strategies, estate planning tools, and comprehensive wealth management solutions that go beyond traditional investment advice. Our existing client base shows these individuals are typically proactively managing complex financial transitions and seeking strategic, personalized guidance.

AGENT:
Excellent signals. Let me structure your HNW audience definition:

**Demographics:** Ages 45-65, $1M+ investable assets, executives/business owners
**Behavioral Signals:** Researching retirement transitions, succession planning, tax optimization, estate planning
**Life Events:** Company acquisitions, IPO windfalls, major liquidity events
**Intent Signals:** Seeking comprehensive wealth management beyond basic investment advice

Your 50K client CRM provides strong lookalike modeling foundation for these behavioral patterns.

For audience sizing in your target DMAs, what percentage of your current client base falls within these 10 markets (NYC, SF, LA, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Denver, Miami, Dallas, DC)? This will help validate our geographic concentration strategy.

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 5 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
About 72% of our current client base is concentrated in these top DMAs. San Francisco, New York, and Los Angeles alone represent nearly 40% of our existing AUM. Our first-party data shows these markets have the highest density of tech executives, financial services professionals, and entrepreneurs who match our ideal client profile. The geographic concentration makes our targeted media approach even more strategic.

AGENT:
Perfect. 72% concentration in target DMAs with SF/NYC/LA representing 40% validates your geographic focus strategy. This density supports efficient media spend allocation and premium targeting.

Let me model your target audience sizing across these markets. Based on HNW demographics (1M+ investable assets, 45-65, exec/business owner profiles) and your behavioral signals, I estimate roughly 0.8-1.2% of total population in these DMAs as your addressable audience.

For NYC metro (20.1M population), that suggests ~200K potential targets. SF Bay Area (7.7M) yields ~80K. Your 50K client lookalike data will significantly improve precision within these pools.

Step 3 complete. Now for geography allocation: Given SF/NYC/LA represent 40% of your current AUM, should we weight media spend proportionally to existing client concentration, or do you want to explore expansion opportunities in the other seven DMAs?

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 6 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We want to maintain our strength in SF/NYC/LA while strategically expanding. I'd recommend allocating about 50-60% of our budget to those core markets, and using the remaining 40-50% to test and penetrate emerging high-potential markets like Boston, Chicago, and Seattle. Our first-party data suggests these markets have untapped HNW populations that align with our ideal client profile, so we shouldn't just replicate our existing footprint but look to intelligently expand.

AGENT:
Excellent strategic approach. Let me model your geographic allocation:

**Core Markets (55% = $825K):**
- SF Bay Area: $330K 
- NYC Metro: $330K
- LA Metro: $165K

**Expansion Markets (45% = $675K):**
- Boston: $135K
- Chicago: $135K  
- Seattle: $135K
- Denver: $90K
- Miami: $90K
- Dallas: $90K

This 55/45 split maintains strength in proven markets while providing meaningful investment for expansion testing. The $135K allocation in Boston/Chicago/Seattle allows for robust audience development, while smaller allocations in Denver/Miami/Dallas enable market validation.

Your $600 per SQL efficiency target remains realistic across all markets, though expansion DMAs may require 10-15% premium initially as lookalike models optimize.

Step 4 complete. Now let's refine your value proposition. Beyond comprehensive wealth management, what specific outcomes do your HNW prospects value most - tax savings, succession planning expertise, or exclusive access to investment opportunities?

TURN 7 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our HNW clients consistently tell us they value tax optimization above everything else. They're looking for strategic tax planning that goes beyond basic advice - we're talking about sophisticated strategies that can save high-earning executives and business owners hundreds of thousands in annual tax liability. Succession planning runs a close second, particularly for business owners looking to transition their companies strategically while minimizing tax exposure. Our value prop isn't just about investment returns, it's about comprehensive financial architecture that protects and grows wealth across generations.

AGENT:
Perfect positioning. Your value proposition centers on **tax optimization as wealth preservation** - a compelling differentiator for HNW prospects facing complex financial transitions.

**Primary Value Proposition:** "Sophisticated tax strategies that save executives and business owners hundreds of thousands annually"

**Secondary Value Proposition:** "Strategic succession planning that minimizes tax exposure during business transitions"

**Supporting Message:** "Comprehensive financial architecture for generational wealth building"

This messaging framework positions you as strategic tax advisors first, investment managers second - addressing the primary pain point your CRM data reveals.

For creative testing, we should develop messaging variants around:
- Tax savings quantification ("Save $200K+ annually")
- Succession planning urgency ("Exit strategies that protect wealth")
- Exclusive expertise positioning ("Strategies only available to $1M+ investors")

Step 5 complete. Your $1.5M budget is well-allocated across core and expansion markets. Ready to build your channel strategy based on where HNW prospects consume financial content?

TURN 8 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
These messaging angles are spot on. Our CRM insights show HNW prospects want precision and exclusivity - quantifying tax savings and positioning our strategies as elite will resonate. LinkedIn, financial publisher direct placements, and podcast sponsorships will be critical for reaching these executives. We want contextual placement that signals sophistication and expertise, not just broad financial content. Our channel mix needs to feel curated, not commoditized.

AGENT:
Excellent channel instincts. Your focus on contextual sophistication aligns perfectly with HNW behavior patterns. Let me structure your channel strategy:

**Primary Channels (70% = $1.05M):**
- LinkedIn (40% = $600K): Executive targeting with lookalike modeling from your 50K CRM
- Financial Publisher Direct (20% = $300K): WSJ, Barron's, Financial Planning premium placements
- Premium Podcast Sponsorships (10% = $150K): Tax/wealth management shows with HNW audiences

**Secondary Channels (30% = $450K):**
- Search (15% = $225K): High-intent tax optimization and succession planning keywords
- Programmatic Premium (10% = $150K): Financial sites with income/asset targeting
- CTV/Streaming (5% = $75K): Business news content targeting

This mix prioritizes contextual relevance over reach. LinkedIn's professional targeting with your CRM lookalikes should drive highest efficiency. Financial publisher direct placements provide credibility halo effect.

At $600 per SQL target, LinkedIn should deliver $400-500 cost per lead, while premium placements may run $800-1,200 but with higher conversion quality.

Does this channel allocation match your sophistication requirements?
