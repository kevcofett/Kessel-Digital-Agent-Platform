# Media Plan Output: Mass National Campaign - Simplicity Test

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

For your FreshBite Snacks launch, I want to make sure we define success precisely. You mentioned brand awareness - what specific business outcome are you trying to achieve? Are you looking to establish baseline awareness for the new line, increase consideration among current customers, or drive trial purchases?

Turn 2:
Perfect - establishing baseline awareness and driving trial curiosity is a clear objective. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success as a number. 

You mentioned brand lift studies - what specific metric will define success? Are you targeting a specific percentage of aided awareness, unaided awareness, or purchase intent among your target audience?

Turn 4:
Perfect! Let me model your efficiency targets:

$8M budget ÷ 65-75M people = $0.11-$0.12 cost per reach point

For national brand awareness campaigns, CPMs typically run $8-15 depending on channel mix. At 50-60% reach, you're targeting roughly 3-4 frequency, which aligns well with awareness building.

Your efficiency target looks realistic for a brand campaign of this scale. The 15-20% awareness lift with 50-60% reach is achievable with proper frequency distribution.

Now let's move to economics. Since this is a brand awareness campaign rather than direct response, what's the business value of achieving this awareness lift? Do you have projections for how awareness translates to sales volume or market share for the new line?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - 15-20% aided brand awareness lift is a clear success metric. To complete our outcome framework, I need one more piece: what's your target reach? 

With $8M targeting adults 18-54 nationally (roughly 130M people), are you aiming to reach a specific percentage of this audience, or do you have a target number of people you want to expose to the FreshBite message?

Turn 6:
Excellent - that's much more precise. 25-44 health-conscious urban/suburban professionals narrows your universe from 130M to roughly 35-40M people, which actually strengthens your plan significantly.

Let me recalculate: $8M targeting 35-40M people = $0.20-$0.23 cost per reach point. At 50-60% reach, you're now targeting 18-24M people with stronger frequency (4-5x) among a highly relevant audience.

This is much more efficient than broad 18-54 targeting and aligns perfectly with awareness goals.

A few signals to consider: Do you want to include parents in this 25-44 group, or focus on childless professionals? And should we prioritize specific metro areas where this demographic is concentrated, like tech hubs and major urban centers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Got it. I'll model using a reasonable assumption based on snack industry benchmarks. For new snack launches, successful awareness campaigns typically drive 1-2% trial rates among reached audiences, with 2-3% market share achievable in year one. This validates your $8M investment as reasonable for category entry.

Your plan is realistic: 50-60% reach with 15-20% awareness lift should support your market share goals.

Now let's define your audience precisely. You mentioned adults 18-54 who buy snacks - that's about 130M people nationally. To optimize your $8M efficiently, we need to get more specific. What demographic, behavioral, or lifestyle signals best identify your ideal FreshBite customer?

Turn 7:
Perfect! Including parents expands your addressable audience while maintaining relevance. Health-conscious parents in professional metros are ideal for premium snack positioning.

Let me model your priority markets:

**TARGET GEOGRAPHY: TOP 6 METROS**

| DMA | Total Population | Target Audience Size | Target Audience % |
|-----|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| New York | 7.4M | 1.8M | 24% |
| San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose | 2.7M | 850K | 31% |
| Boston | 2.4M | 720K | 30% |
| Seattle-Tacoma | 1.9M | 570K | 30% |
| Denver | 1.7M | 510K | 30% |
| Austin | 1.2M | 360K | 30% |
| **TOTAL** | **15.3M** | **4.8M** | **31%** |

This concentrated approach gives you 4.8M highly qualified targets vs 35-40M nationally. At $8M budget, that's $1.67 per target - allowing for 8-10 frequency among your ideal customers.

Should we add 2-3 secondary metros like Portland, Nashville, or DC, or focus maximum impact on these six core markets?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Excellent decision! Concentrating on six core metros with $1.67 per target gives you the frequency needed to break through and establish FreshBite in the most receptive markets first.

Now let's allocate your $8M budget across these markets. I recommend weighting based on both audience size and strategic importance:

**PROPOSED BUDGET ALLOCATION:**

| Market | Audience Size | Budget | % of Total | Cost per Target |
|--------|---------------|---------|------------|-----------------|
| New York | 1.8M | $3.0M | 37.5% | $1.67 |
| San Francisco | 850K | $1.7M | 21.3% | $2.00 |
| Boston | 720K | $1.2M | 15.0% | $1.67 |
| Seattle | 570K | $950K | 11.9% | $1.67 |
| Denver | 510K | $850K | 10.6% | $1.67 |
| Austin | 360K | $300K | 3.8% | $0.83 |

San Francisco gets premium investment given the perfect brand-market fit you mentioned. Does this allocation feel right, or would you adjust any markets based on strategic priorities?

Turn 9:
Great thinking! Let me adjust that allocation:

**REVISED BUDGET ALLOCATION:**

| Market | Audience Size | Budget | % of Total | Cost per Target |
|--------|---------------|---------|------------|-----------------|
| New York | 1.8M | $3.0M | 37.5% | $1.67 |
| San Francisco | 850K | $1.7M | 21.3% | $2.00 |
| Boston | 720K | $1.2M | 15.0% | $1.67 |
| Seattle | 570K | $1.1M | 13.8% | $1.93 |
| Denver | 510K | $950K | 11.9% | $1.86 |
| Austin | 360K | $50K | 0.6% | $0.14 |

This gives Seattle and Denver stronger investment levels that better match their audience potential, while keeping Austin as a minimal test market.

Now let's develop your value proposition. For health-conscious professionals and parents in these metros, what makes FreshBite different from existing snack options? What's the key message that will break through and create curiosity when they see you in stores?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Perfect! "Real food, real flavor" captures the no-compromise positioning beautifully. That message will resonate strongly with professionals and parents who are tired of choosing between taste and health.

**VALUE PROPOSITION FRAMEWORK:**

**Core Promise:** FreshBite delivers genuine taste without nutritional sacrifice
**Key Differentiator:** Clean ingredients that don't compromise on flavor
**Target Insight:** Health-conscious consumers want convenient snacks that align with their values
**Proof Points:** High-quality ingredients, real flavors, no artificial compromises

This positioning sets up perfectly for awareness creative that can demonstrate the taste-health balance visually and emotionally.

Now let's build your channel strategy. With $8M for brand awareness across six metros targeting 4.8M health-conscious professionals and parents, we need channels that deliver both reach and credibility with this audience. What's your thinking on channel preferences - any channels you definitely want to include or avoid?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 11:
Excellent channel instincts! CTV, YouTube, and targeted display align perfectly with your audience's media consumption and allow for precise targeting in your six metros.

**RECOMMENDED CHANNEL MIX:**

**Connected TV (45% - $3.6M)**
- Premium reach among cord-cutting professionals
- High-impact awareness format
- Precise geographic and demographic targeting

**YouTube (35% - $2.8M)**
- Strong engagement with health/lifestyle content
- Multiple ad formats for awareness building
- Excellent targeting capabilities

**Targeted Display (20% - $1.6M)**
- Health, wellness, and parenting sites
- Professional/lifestyle publications
- Retargeting for frequency building

This mix prioritizes video for maximum awareness impact while using display for targeted reinforcement. The 80/20 video-to-display split maximizes brand building potential.

Does this channel allocation feel right, or would you adjust the weightings based on your brand priorities?
