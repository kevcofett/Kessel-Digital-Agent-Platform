# Media Plan Output: Full 10-Step Media Planning

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business outcome. You mentioned acquiring 15,000 new customers - is customer acquisition your primary objective, or are you also focused on revenue growth, brand awareness, or retention?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your primary objective is customer acquisition with a focus on high-LTV customers to drive revenue growth and market share expansion.

Let me calculate your implied efficiency: $750K ÷ 15,000 customers = $50 per customer acquisition cost. For home decor ecommerce, typical CAC runs $60-100 based on industry benchmarks, so you're targeting about 17-50% better efficiency than market average. This is ambitious but achievable with tight targeting.

To assess if this efficiency is realistic, what's the average order value and customer lifetime value you're seeing? This will help us determine if $50 CAC makes sense for your unit economics.

Turn 4:
Excellent decision. Let's model around 10,000 customers at $75 CAC using your full $750K budget. This gives us much stronger execution confidence and aligns with market realities for home decor.

At $250 AOV and $450 LTV, your 6:1 LTV:CAC ratio is very healthy. This also gives us flexibility - if we achieve better than $75 CAC through optimization, we could potentially scale toward that 15,000 stretch goal.

Now let's define your target audience. You mentioned wanting high-LTV customers specifically. What signals or characteristics identify your most valuable customers? For example, do you see patterns in demographics, purchase behavior, home ownership status, or spending habits that correlate with higher lifetime value?

Turn 5:
Perfect. Those are strong indicators - homeowners 30-55 with disposable income who start with decor and graduate to furniture shows clear progression behavior that drives higher LTV.

A few quick clarifications to sharpen this profile: When you say "higher disposable income," are we talking household income above $75K, $100K, or higher? And for geography, are you thinking nationwide, or do you see stronger performance in specific regions like coastal metros, suburbs around major cities, or particular states?

These details will help us size your addressable audience and ensure we can realistically reach 10,000 of these high-value prospects within your budget.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it. Let me model using your estimates and show what they imply. With $250 AOV and $450 LTV, your $50 target CAC gives you a 9:1 LTV:CAC ratio, which is excellent - most successful ecommerce businesses aim for 3:1 to 5:1. 

This suggests either your LTV is conservative or your CAC target is very aggressive. For home decor with $250 AOV, you could likely afford $75-90 CAC and still maintain healthy unit economics.

The key question: Are you confident you can hit $50 CAC, or would building the plan around a more market-realistic $75 CAC be smarter? At $75 CAC, your $750K budget would acquire 10,000 customers instead of 15,000, but with much higher confidence of success.

What feels more important - the aggressive 15,000 target or building a plan you're confident can execute?

Turn 7:
Smart approach - depth over breadth in proven markets. Focusing on those 6 core DMAs gives us much higher confidence in executing at $75 CAC.

Now let's validate our budget allocation. With $750K total budget, we need to account for creative production, landing page optimization, and campaign management alongside media spend. 

For a plan this size, I'd typically recommend 80-85% for media ($600K-$637K) and 15-20% for creative, landing pages, and management ($113K-$150K). This leaves us $600K+ for pure media spend to acquire those 10,000 customers.

Does this budget split make sense for your organization? Do you have internal creative resources, or will you need external support for creative production and landing page development?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Excellent targeting. High-income coastal metros and affluent suburbs around major cities - that's a well-defined, valuable audience segment.

Let me structure your geography focus. Based on what you've described, we're looking at these primary DMAs:
- San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose  
- New York
- Boston-Manchester
- Seattle-Tacoma
- Chicago
- Washington DC-Hagerstown

Should we build the plan focused on these 6 core DMAs where you know you perform well, or do you want to include additional markets for expansion? Focusing on proven markets would give us higher confidence in hitting that $75 CAC target, while adding markets could provide growth upside but with more risk.

What's your preference for geographic scope?

Turn 8:
Perfect. Let's allocate $600K for media spend (80%) and $150K for creative, optimization, and management support. That gives us exactly $60 per customer for media ($600K ÷ 10,000), which is well within the $60-100 home decor benchmark and leaves us $15 cushion versus your $75 total CAC target.

Now for your value proposition. Since you're targeting high-income homeowners who progress from decor to furniture, what key message resonates most with these customers? Are you positioned as premium quality, design-forward trends, curated collections, or something else? 

Understanding how you differentiate from competitors like Wayfair, West Elm, or CB2 will help us craft messaging that attracts those high-LTV customers specifically.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 9:
Excellent positioning - "curated design consultation" versus overwhelming choice really differentiates you in the market. That lifestyle-focused, approachable elegance message should resonate strongly with your high-income urban professionals.

Now let's build your channel strategy. With $600K media spend across 6 DMAs targeting affluent homeowners 30-55, I'm thinking a mix that balances performance and brand building:

**Meta/Instagram (40% - $240K)**: Visual platform perfect for home decor, strong targeting for affluent demographics
**Google Search (30% - $180K)**: Capture high-intent furniture and decor searches
**Google Display/YouTube (20% - $120K)**: Reach and retargeting for lifestyle messaging
**Pinterest (10% - $60K)**: Natural fit for home design inspiration

This gives you performance-driven acquisition while building brand awareness. Does this channel mix align with where you see your target customers spending time?

Turn 11:
Absolutely. Strong measurement is critical for a plan this sophisticated. Here's what I'd recommend:

**Essential Tracking Infrastructure:**
- Customer data platform (CDP) to unify touchpoints - budget ~$2K-5K/month
- Enhanced Google Analytics 4 setup with custom events for decor→furniture progression
- First-party data collection for email/SMS attribution
- Geo-holdout testing framework for true incrementality measurement

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- 30/60/90-day customer value progression 
- Channel-specific customer quality scores
- Time-to-second-purchase by acquisition channel
- Incremental lift vs. platform-reported attribution

**Testing Framework:**
- Geographic holdouts for Meta and Google (essential given your concentrated DMAs)
- Creative rotation testing for lifestyle messaging
- Landing page optimization for conversion rate improvement

This measurement upgrade would require ~$15K-25K from your $150K operations budget. The payoff is huge - you'll actually know which channels deliver your high-LTV customers versus just initial conversions.

Should we factor this measurement investment into the plan, or do you need to validate budget internally first?

Turn 12:
Perfect. Let's finalize your testing strategy to ensure continuous optimization:

**Q1 Testing Priorities:**
- Channel efficiency validation (which delivers highest LTV customers)
- Creative messaging: lifestyle aspiration vs. product features
- Landing page experience: curated collections vs. individual products
- Audience refinement within your 6 core DMAs

**Risk Mitigation:**
- 15% budget flexibility reserve for reallocation based on performance
- Backup creative concepts if initial lifestyle messaging doesn't convert
- Alternative channel options (LinkedIn for affluent professionals, streaming TV for brand building)
- Economic downturn scenario planning given discretionary spending nature of home decor

Your plan summary: $750K total budget, 10,000 high-LTV customers at $75 CAC across 6 core DMAs, with robust measurement infrastructure to optimize toward furniture progression customers.

Any final concerns or areas where you'd want additional risk mitigation before we lock this strategy?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Absolutely - flexibility is crucial for optimization. Let's structure this with built-in testing phases:

**Phase 1 (Months 1-2)**: Start with 70% of budget to validate channel performance
**Phase 2 (Months 3-12)**: Reallocate based on data, potentially shifting 10-20% to top performers

For measurement, I recommend tracking incremental lift through geo-holdout tests rather than relying solely on platform attribution. Given your $60 media CAC target, we'll need to measure true incrementality to avoid platform inflation.

Key metrics: Incremental customers acquired, blended CAC across channels, customer quality scores, and progression from decor to furniture purchases.

What's your current measurement setup? Do you have robust analytics to track customer journeys from acquisition through repeat purchases, or is that something we need to build into the plan?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 13:
Excellent. You've built a solid, realistic media plan with strong fundamentals:

**Plan Summary:**
- **Objective:** 10,000 high-LTV customers at $75 CAC
- **Budget:** $750K ($600K media, $125K ops, $25K measurement infrastructure)
- **Geography:** 6 proven DMAs with affluent demographics
- **Channels:** Visual-first mix (Meta 40%, Google 50%, Pinterest 10%)
- **Measurement:** Robust tracking for customer progression and true incrementality
- **Testing:** Built-in flexibility with 15% reallocation reserve

This plan balances ambition with execution confidence. Your focus on proven markets, realistic efficiency targets, and measurement infrastructure sets you up for both immediate success and long-term optimization.

The economic contingency planning is smart given discretionary spending patterns. With quarterly performance reviews and that budget flexibility, you can adapt quickly to market conditions.
