# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience with Segment-Specific Channels

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I am excited to build a media plan with you. We will cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

$5M / 50,000 enrollments = $100 per enrollment. For online education, typical acquisition costs run $80-150, so you're targeting solid efficiency. Your three-segment approach is smart - different audiences absolutely need different channel strategies.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 50,000 enrollments?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your objective is revenue growth through market diversification, with 50,000 total enrollments as the volume target.

How do you measure success as a number? Are you tracking total revenue, average revenue per enrollment, or something else as your primary KPI?

The different revenue potentials you mentioned - higher willingness to pay for career changers, bulk licensing for corporate - suggest we'll need segment-specific efficiency targets rather than a blended $100 per enrollment.

Turn 4:
Perfect allocation strategy. Let me update our projections:

**Segment Allocation & Revenue:**
- Corporate L&D: 12,500 × $7,500 = $93.75M
- Career Changers: 25,000 × $1,750 = $43.75M  
- College-Age: 12,500 × $650 = $8.125M
- **Total Revenue: $145.625M**

**Segment-Specific CAC Targets:**
Given your strong LTV ratios, you can afford:
- Corporate L&D: Up to $750 CAC (10:1 ratio)
- Career Changers: Up to $175 CAC (10:1 ratio)
- College-Age: $65 CAC (10:1 ratio)

This gives you significant flexibility to invest in premium channels for high-value segments while staying efficient on college-age acquisition.

Your audience definitions are already solid. For geography, you mentioned tech hubs for career changers, national with college town indexing for Gen Z, and corporate HQ cities for L&D. 

Should we refine the geographic targeting further, or move to budget allocation across these segments?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent. Let me model this out:

**Revenue Projections by Segment:**
- Career Changers: $1,750 average × allocation = revenue potential
- Corporate L&D: $7,500 average × allocation = revenue potential  
- College-Age: $650 average × allocation = revenue potential

**Efficiency Analysis:**
At $100 blended CAC with these ARPU levels, your LTV:CAC ratios would be:
- Career Changers: 17.5:1 (very strong)
- Corporate L&D: 75:1 (exceptional) 
- College-Age: 6.5:1 (solid)

This suggests you could afford much higher acquisition costs for career changers and corporate segments while staying conservative on college-age.

How do you want to allocate the 50,000 enrollments across your three segments? The economics suggest prioritizing corporate and career changers if acquisition costs allow.

Turn 6:
Perfect. Corporate L&D with their $160 CAC target and $2M budget needs precision over volume.

**LinkedIn Strategy Foundation:**
- Sponsored Content targeting L&D titles at 1,000+ employee companies
- LinkedIn Sales Navigator for ABM prospect identification  
- Thought leadership content targeting HR/L&D decision influencers

**Trade Publication Integration:**
- HR Executive, Training Magazine, Chief Learning Officer
- Native content and display in digital editions
- Webinar sponsorships for lead generation

**ABM Multi-Touch Sequence:**
Given the longer B2B cycle, you'll need 6-8 touchpoints before conversion. LinkedIn awareness → trade pub credibility → direct outreach → demo scheduling.

At $160 CAC for 12,500 corporate enrollments, this suggests average deal sizes around $7,500 but some bulk licenses could be much larger.

What's your typical corporate sales cycle length, and do you have existing corporate relationships that could accelerate the ABM approach?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Excellent. Let me allocate your $5M budget based on the CAC targets and volume goals:

**Budget Allocation by Segment:**
- Corporate L&D: 12,500 × $750 = $9.375M (exceeds total budget)
- Career Changers: 25,000 × $175 = $4.375M  
- College-Age: 12,500 × $65 = $812.5K

The math reveals we need to optimize allocation. At maximum affordable CACs, corporate alone would consume $9.375M of your $5M budget.

**Revised Budget Strategy:**
- Corporate L&D: $2M (40%) = $160 CAC
- Career Changers: $2.5M (50%) = $100 CAC  
- College-Age: $500K (10%) = $40 CAC

This keeps all segments well within profitable ratios while maximizing your premium segment investment. Corporate still gets 21:1 LTV:CAC at $160.

Now for channels - each segment needs completely different approaches. Should we start with Corporate L&D since they have the highest value and longest sales cycle?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Excellent - 4-6 month cycles mean your corporate budget needs to sustain engagement while prospects move through evaluation.

**Corporate Channel Allocation ($2M):**
- LinkedIn (60% = $1.2M): Sponsored content, Sales Navigator, thought leadership
- Trade Publications (25% = $500K): Native content, display, webinar sponsorships  
- ABM Technology (15% = $300K): Intent data, account intelligence, personalization

With 4-6 month cycles, you'll see pipeline building in Q1 converting in Q2-Q3. Your existing tech/financial services case studies are perfect social proof for LinkedIn content and trade pub native articles.

Now let's tackle Career Changers - your largest volume segment at 25,000 enrollments with $2.5M budget and $100 CAC target. These mid-career professionals do extensive research but move faster than corporate buyers.

What channels beyond LinkedIn are you considering for career changers, and how long is their typical decision timeline?

Turn 8:
Perfect - 6-8 week cycles allow for more aggressive optimization than corporate.

**Career Changer Channel Allocation ($2.5M):**
- LinkedIn (40% = $1M): Sponsored content, video testimonials from career switchers
- Podcast Advertising (25% = $625K): Business/tech shows, host-read endorsements
- Search (25% = $625K): High-intent keywords around career transition + certification
- Content/SEO (10% = $250K): Research-driven content supporting their evaluation process

At $100 CAC for 25,000 enrollments, this gives solid investment per channel for optimization. Podcasts and search complement LinkedIn's targeting with different intent moments.

Finally, College-Age with $500K budget, $40 CAC target, and 12,500 enrollments. These Gen Z learners are mobile-first, creator-influenced, and need a completely different approach.

Given their price sensitivity and social media behavior, are you thinking TikTok and Instagram as primary channels, and how quickly do they typically convert?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Perfect - 2-3 week conversion cycles allow for rapid testing and optimization.

**College-Age Channel Allocation ($500K):**
- TikTok (45% = $225K): Creator partnerships, student transformation content
- Instagram (35% = $175K): Stories, Reels, influencer collaborations  
- Influencer Partnerships (20% = $100K): Micro-influencers in education/career space

At $40 CAC for 12,500 enrollments, this prioritizes authentic creator content over traditional ads. Gen Z trusts peer recommendations over brand messaging.

**Cross-Segment Channel Summary:**
- Corporate L&D: LinkedIn-heavy ABM approach (4-6 month cycle)
- Career Changers: LinkedIn + podcasts + search (6-8 week cycle)  
- College-Age: TikTok + Instagram + influencers (2-3 week cycle)

Now for measurement - with three distinct funnels and conversion timelines, how will you track attribution across these different customer journeys? Each segment needs different measurement approaches given their channel mix and cycle length.

Turn 11:
Perfect - college-age as your innovation lab is strategically brilliant. 2-3 week cycles mean you can test 8-10 iterations while corporate runs one cycle.

**Testing Strategy:**
- College-Age: Rapid creative testing, influencer performance, platform optimization
- Career Changers: Apply proven college-age creative principles to LinkedIn/podcast content  
- Corporate L&D: Leverage messaging insights for ABM personalization

**Key Testing Areas for College-Age:**
- Creator vs. brand content performance
- Transformation story formats (before/after, day-in-life, success metrics)
- Platform-specific creative (TikTok vertical vs. Instagram carousel)
- Promo code vs. organic conversion rates

Finally, let's address risks. Your biggest exposure is the 4-6 month corporate pipeline - if that segment underperforms, it represents 40% of your budget with delayed feedback. Also, creator-dependent channels (TikTok/Instagram) face platform algorithm and influencer reliability risks.

What's your biggest concern about this three-segment approach, and how do you want to mitigate channel concentration risks?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 10:
Excellent - segmented measurement that matches behavior patterns. Your approach is strategically sound:

**Measurement Framework:**
- Corporate L&D: 90-day multi-touch (matches 4-6 month sales cycle)
- Career Changers: 30-day last-touch + view-through (supports 6-8 week research)
- College-Age: Real-time + promo codes (captures 2-3 week impulse decisions)

**Critical Measurement Considerations:**
Given your different attribution windows, you'll need segment-specific dashboards to avoid blended metrics distorting performance. Corporate's 90-day window means Q1 spend may not show conversions until Q2-Q3.

**Attribution Challenges to Plan For:**
- LinkedIn cross-segment attribution (both corporate and career changers use it)
- Podcast measurement typically relies on promo codes or branded search lift
- TikTok/Instagram attribution can be inconsistent - creator codes provide cleaner tracking

For testing strategy, which segment offers the best learning velocity given your different conversion cycles? College-age at 2-3 weeks allows fastest iteration, while corporate takes months to validate changes.

Turn 13:
Perfect! You've built a sophisticated media plan that balances ambition with smart risk management.

**30-Day Dashboard Framework:**
- **Corporate L&D**: LinkedIn engagement rates, trade pub CTR, pipeline quality scores
- **Career Changers**: Search conversion rates, podcast attribution, LinkedIn CAC trends  
- **College-Age**: Creator performance, platform CPMs, promo code conversion rates

**Key Success Metrics by Segment:**
- Corporate: 2%+ pipeline conversion rate (circuit breaker threshold)
- Career Changers: <$100 CAC maintenance 
- College-Age: Creative iteration velocity and cost efficiency

**Next 30 Days Action Items:**
1. Implement segment-specific attribution tracking
2. Launch corporate ABM with existing case study content
3. Begin college-age creator testing for rapid learning
4. Set up monthly pipeline reviews with reallocation triggers

You've created a plan that maximizes your $145.6M revenue potential while protecting against the biggest risks. The segmented approach, measurement discipline, and dynamic budget flexibility give you multiple paths to success. 

Strong work building this strategy - you're ready to execute with confidence.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 12:
Excellent risk assessment. Your corporate exposure is significant - $2M with 4-6 month feedback loops requires careful monitoring.

**Risk Mitigation Strategy:**
- **Monthly Pipeline Reviews**: Track LinkedIn engagement, trade pub CTRs, and ABM account progression
- **60-Day Circuit Breaker**: If corporate pipeline metrics lag benchmarks, reallocate 25% ($500K) to career changers
- **Lead Quality Gates**: Strict qualification on company size, L&D budget authority, and buying timeline
- **Case Study Amplification**: Use existing client success stories across all corporate touchpoints

**Budget Reallocation Trigger:**
If corporate pipeline conversion rate drops below 2% after 60 days, shift $500K to career changers (increasing their CAC to $120 - still profitable at 14.6:1 LTV ratio).

**Additional Safeguards:**
- Diversify corporate channels beyond LinkedIn/trade pubs if early performance lags
- Use college-age testing insights to optimize career changer creative faster
- Build corporate nurture sequences to maintain engagement during long cycles

You've built a sophisticated, segment-specific media plan with $145.6M revenue potential. The measurement framework, testing strategy, and risk mitigation create a robust foundation for execution. Ready to move forward with this approach?
