# Media Plan Output: Volume Target Increase

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business outcome. You mentioned acquiring 5,000 new customers - is customer acquisition your primary objective, or are you also focused on revenue targets or other business outcomes alongside the customer count?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your objective is customer acquisition to grow market presence, with 5,000 new customers as your primary KPI and target volume.

Let me run the economics: $400K ÷ 5,000 customers = $80 per customer acquisition cost. With your $320 LTV, that's a 4:1 LTV to CAC ratio - solid and sustainable for home goods where typical acquisition costs run $60-100.

Your target efficiency is right in the sweet spot for the category. This gives us good flexibility for channel mix and audience targeting.

What's your timeline for hitting these 5,000 customers - is this spread evenly across Q1-Q2, or do you have specific monthly targets?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
That pacing makes sense - 1,300 in Q1 and 1,700 in Q2 allows for optimization learnings to improve Q2 performance. The front-loaded approach is smart for building momentum.

Let me update the economics: Q1 needs $104K for 1,300 customers ($80 each), Q2 needs $136K for 1,700 customers. That leaves $160K for Q1 and $240K for Q2 - giving you room above the minimum acquisition spend for reach building and testing.

Your $80 target CAC is achievable in home goods, and the 6-month timeline allows proper campaign optimization. Step 2 is complete - your economics are realistic and well-structured.

Now for Step 3 - let's define your target audience. Who is your ideal customer for home goods? Are you targeting homeowners, renters, specific age groups, or particular lifestyle segments?

Turn 4:
Excellent targeting foundation. Homeowners 30-55 with disposable income is a strong segment for home goods - they have both the need and means to invest in quality pieces.

Let me dig deeper into a few key areas that will impact our media strategy. Starting with household income - what income threshold defines "disposable income" for your ideal customer? Are we talking $75K+, $100K+, or a different range that aligns with your product pricing?

Turn 5:
Perfect. $100K+ household income aligns well with your $500-2,000 product range and supports the $320 LTV.

Now let's think about homeownership timing, which is crucial for home goods. Are you targeting recent homeowners (moved within 1-2 years) who are actively decorating, or established homeowners who are redecorating? This significantly impacts both audience size and purchase urgency.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent - recent homeowners (1-2 years) are high-intent for home goods with strong purchase urgency. That's a more targeted but higher-converting audience than general homeowners.

One more key signal: are you targeting specific home values or neighborhoods? Recent buyers of $400K+ homes behave differently than $200K home buyers in terms of décor spending patterns. This will help us refine targeting precision for your $80 CAC goal.

Turn 7:
Perfect. Recent homeowners (1-2 years), $400-800K home values, $100K+ household income, ages 30-55 - that's a well-defined, high-intent audience that aligns with your premium positioning and $320 LTV.

This audience profile supports your $80 CAC target. Recent homeowners in that value range typically show 2-3x higher conversion rates than general audiences for home goods.

Step 3 complete. Now for Step 4 - Geography. Are you targeting nationally, or do you have specific regions, states, or metro areas where you want to focus? Home values and design preferences can vary significantly by geography.

Turn 9:
Smart adjustment. Let me model 6,000 customers with potential budget increase:

$500K ÷ 6,000 = $83 CAC - very close to your original $80 target and well within home goods benchmarks. This is much more realistic than the $50 efficiency that 8,000 would require.

At $83 CAC with your $320 LTV, you maintain a healthy 3.9:1 ratio. The extra $100K also gives you flexibility for testing and optimization without risking the core plan.

6,000 customers feels achievable with your recent homeowner audience and the additional budget cushion. This balances board ambitions with market realities.

Before we finalize this direction - what's your confidence level on securing that extra $100K? I want to make sure we're building a plan you can actually execute.

Turn 10:
Great - 80% confidence gives us a solid foundation. Let's proceed with the $500K budget and 6,000 customer target at $83 CAC.

This positions you well with the board - you're delivering 20% more customers than originally planned while maintaining efficient economics. The $83 CAC is sustainable and gives room for optimization.

Step 2 complete with realistic economics locked in. Back to Step 4 - Geography. With your recent homeowner audience and premium positioning, are you targeting nationally or focusing on specific regions where $400-800K homes are concentrated and design-forward consumers are most active?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Let me update our projections. $400K ÷ 8,000 = $50 per customer. That's 37.5% more efficient than our $80 baseline.

For home goods, $50 CAC is aggressive - typical runs $60-100. At $50 vs your $320 LTV, you'd have a 6.4:1 ratio which is excellent if achievable, but requires significant efficiency gains.

To hit $50 CAC with your premium audience (recent homeowners, $400-800K homes), you'd need either:
- Tighter targeting to the highest-converting segments
- About $640K budget to maintain $80 efficiency 
- Or a combination of both

The 8,000 target is ambitious but possible with precise execution. Which direction feels more realistic - finding budget flexibility or accepting the efficiency challenge?

Turn 11:
Excellent geographic strategy. Those metros have high concentrations of your target demo and strong home appreciation markets that drive design investment.

Seattle, Denver, Austin, Atlanta, Boston, and California corridor represent roughly 35-40% of the $400-800K home sales market but likely 50-60% of your ideal customers due to higher income density and design-forward culture.

This geographic focus should improve efficiency - you'll reach more qualified prospects per dollar spent versus broad national targeting.

Step 4 complete. Now for Step 5 - Budget allocation. With $500K across those priority metros, do you want to weight budget by market size, test smaller metros first, or allocate evenly to start and optimize based on performance?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 12:
Smart approach. Equal allocation lets you gather clean performance data across metros without bias, then optimize based on actual results.

Let me map this: 6 metros at ~17% each = $85K per metro initially. After 4-6 weeks, you can reallocate based on which markets deliver closest to your $83 CAC target. This gives you $510K total allocation with some flexibility buffer.

The performance-driven reallocation strategy is particularly smart for home goods where local design preferences and competitive landscapes vary significantly by metro.

Step 5 complete. Now for Step 6 - Value Proposition. For recent homeowners looking to create their lifestyle through design, what's your core message? Are you positioned as the quality source, the style authority, the convenience solution, or something else?
