# Media Plan Output: Timeline Compression

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by modeling your efficiency target. $1.2M ÷ 25,000 customers = $48 per customer acquisition cost. With $180 LTV, that's a strong 3.75x LTV:CAC ratio - well above the 3x benchmark for sustainable growth.

Your $48 CAC target is achievable for fashion retail, where we typically see $40-70 depending on brand positioning and channel mix.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 25,000 new customers - is this about revenue growth, market share expansion, or something else?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect. Revenue growth through market share expansion in urban markets - that's a clear objective. 

Your primary KPI is 25,000 new customers, which projects to $4.5M in first-year revenue (25,000 × $180 LTV). That's solid growth momentum.

Let me validate the economics once more. At $48 CAC with $180 LTV, you're targeting healthy unit economics. For fashion retail focusing on fashion-forward women, this efficiency is realistic - premium positioning typically supports the higher end of the $40-70 range.

One consideration: fashion-forward customers often have higher engagement but can be more selective. Your $180 LTV suggests strong customer value, which supports the targeting precision you'll need.

Step 1 complete. Moving to economics - what's your typical gross margin on a first purchase?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Excellent. 55-60% gross margin gives you strong acquisition flexibility. At 57.5% average margin on $180 LTV, you're generating ~$103 gross profit per customer against your $48 CAC target. That's a healthy 2.15x gross profit to CAC ratio.

This validates your economics are sound. You have $55 cushion per customer ($103 gross profit - $48 CAC) to cover retention marketing and operations while maintaining profitability from first purchase.

For premium fashion targeting fashion-forward women, your $48 efficiency target is well-positioned. These customers typically require higher-quality creative and more selective targeting, but your margin structure supports that investment.

Step 2 complete - your unit economics are realistic and sustainable.

Now for Step 3 - let's define your target audience. You mentioned fashion-forward women in urban markets. What age range are you primarily targeting?

Turn 4:
Great profile. Women 25-45, professionals with disposable income, digitally savvy, active on Instagram and TikTok, seeking versatile work-to-social pieces. That's a well-defined fashion-forward segment.

A few clarifying questions to sharpen targeting:

Within that 25-45 range, do you see stronger performance or preference from any particular age cohort - like 25-34 vs 35-45? This can help us weight our audience modeling and channel allocation.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Perfect. Women 28-38, peak career stage, established disposable income, professional-yet-trendy aesthetic, highly active on Instagram and TikTok. That's a precise, high-value segment.

This age cohort typically shows strong fashion purchase intent and brand loyalty when they find the right fit. Their digital behavior aligns well with visual platforms, which should support efficient targeting.

Beyond age and digital behavior, what other audience signals help identify your best customers? For example - do you see patterns in income levels, education, lifestyle interests, or shopping behaviors that distinguish your highest-value customers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 6:
Excellent. $125K-$175K household income, professional roles (marketing/consulting/tech), investing in personal brand, follow design/lifestyle influencers, value sustainability, make considered purchases balancing trend with quality.

This is a sophisticated, high-intent audience that aligns perfectly with your premium positioning and $180 LTV. Their considered purchase behavior and income level support your $48 CAC target.

One more audience dimension - are there any specific lifestyle or interest signals that help you identify these women? For example, do they engage with particular brands, publications, or activities that indicate they're your ideal customer?

Turn 7:
Let me immediately recalculate the impact. 25,000 customers in 6 months instead of 12 means doubling your monthly acquisition pace.

$1.2M ÷ 25,000 = still $48 CAC, but now you need ~4,167 customers per month vs 2,083. That's significantly more aggressive.

Key implications:
- Higher monthly media velocity increases competition for your target audience
- Less time for channel optimization and learning phases  
- Steeper ramp required - you'll need channels that can scale quickly
- Budget concentration may drive up costs in auction-based platforms

For fashion targeting 28-38 professional women, compressed timelines typically increase CAC by 15-25% due to market pressure. Your $48 target might need to flex to $55-60 to achieve this pace.

Do you have flexibility to increase the $1.2M budget, or do we need to model hitting 25,000 customers in 6 months within the current budget constraint?

Turn 8:
Got it. $1.2M budget locked, 25,000 customers in 6 months, targeting $48 CAC with potential flex to $55-60 due to compressed timeline.

Your instinct on Instagram and TikTok is smart - these platforms can scale quickly for fashion-forward women 28-38. The visual format aligns with your product and their behavior patterns.

Before we dive into channels in Step 7, let's finish audience definition since this affects everything. You mentioned they follow design/lifestyle influencers and value sustainability. 

What specific interest categories or brand affinities help you identify these women? For example - do they engage with particular fashion publications, lifestyle brands, or professional development content that signals they're your ideal customer?

Turn 9:
Perfect. Everlane/Cuyana for sustainability, Refinery29/The Skimm for lifestyle, LinkedIn Learning for professional development, Peloton for wellness, Glossier for beauty. These brand affinities create a clear aspirational profile - curated, intentional, quality-driven.

This targeting precision is crucial for your compressed timeline. These specific interest clusters should help you reach the right audience efficiently on Instagram and TikTok without broad targeting waste.

Step 3 complete - you have a well-defined audience.

Moving to Step 4 - Geography. You mentioned urban markets earlier. Which specific cities or regions are you prioritizing for these 25,000 customers?
