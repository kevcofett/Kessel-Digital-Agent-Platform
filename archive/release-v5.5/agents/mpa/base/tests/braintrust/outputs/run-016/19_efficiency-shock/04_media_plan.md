# Media Plan Output: Efficiency Shock

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your economics since you've provided great data. $750K ÷ 15,000 applications = $50 per application. With $2,800 LTV, that's a 56:1 LTV-to-CAC ratio - extremely healthy for insurance where 10-20:1 is typical.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 15,000 applications? Are you focused on premium growth, market share expansion, or something else?

Turn 3:
I understand the challenge - you need to hit aggressive efficiency targets to close that gap. Before we dive into strategies, I need to understand what success looks like beyond just applications.

What's your primary success metric? Are you measuring:
- Total applications submitted (your 15,000 target)
- Qualified applications that meet underwriting criteria
- Actual policies issued after underwriting
- Premium revenue generated

The answer affects how we approach efficiency improvements, since different metrics require different optimization strategies.

Turn 4:
Perfect - qualified applications with strong conversion potential changes everything. This actually creates opportunity to improve efficiency through precision targeting.

Let me model this: if you target high-quality leads aged 35-60 with stable income, your conversion rates from application to issued policy should be significantly higher than industry average. Typical insurance sees 30-40% application-to-policy conversion, but tight targeting can push this to 50-60%.

At 55% conversion, 15,000 qualified applications would yield ~8,250 issued policies. At $2,800 LTV, that's $23M in lifetime value from a $1.8M investment.

Here's the key question: what's your current application-to-policy conversion rate? If we can quantify this, we can model whether the improved conversion economics justify the aggressive $120 efficiency target or if we need even tighter targeting.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
You're absolutely right - thank you for that correction. Let me recalculate based on your $120 floor.

15,000 applications × $120 = $1.8M needed budget. With your $750K budget, you can realistically target about 6,250 applications ($750K ÷ $120).

This creates a significant gap: you need 15,000 but can afford 6,250 - that's 58% short of your goal.

You have three paths forward:
1. Increase budget to $1.8M to hit 15,000 applications
2. Keep $750K budget and target 6,250 applications  
3. Find ways to improve efficiency below the $120 industry floor

Which direction makes most sense for your business situation?

Turn 5:
Your 35% conversion rate is actually solid for insurance - you're not failing. But you're right that precision targeting can improve it.

Getting to 50-60% conversion requires specific capabilities. Do you currently have:
- First-party data from existing policyholders for lookalike modeling
- Integration with data providers for income/credit verification
- Ability to exclude high-risk health indicators in targeting

The gap between 35% and 50% conversion could reduce your effective cost per issued policy from $343 to $240 - that's meaningful efficiency improvement even if application cost stays at $120.

What first-party data assets do you have access to for targeting?

Turn 6:
I think there may be some confusion - we already addressed this earlier. You corrected me that $120 is your industry floor, and I recalculated showing you need $1.8M to hit 15,000 applications at $120 each, creating a 58% gap with your $750K budget.

We then established your primary metric is qualified applications with 35% conversion to issued policies, and I asked about your first-party data capabilities to improve targeting precision.

To keep us moving forward: what first-party data do you have from existing policyholders that we could use for lookalike targeting?

Turn 7:
That's actually more than many insurers have to work with. Age, income range, and smoking status are strong signals for lookalike modeling - especially combined.

Your best efficiency path is likely starting with tight lookalikes from your highest-converting policyholders, then expanding based on performance. This could improve both application quality and conversion rates.

But let's be realistic about the math: even with better targeting, closing a 58% efficiency gap is aggressive. We may need to model a hybrid approach - perhaps 10,000-12,000 high-quality applications rather than 15,000.

Before we dive into audience strategy, what geography are you targeting? National, specific states, or regional focus?

Turn 8:
Smart insight - geographic concentration where you already convert well is a proven efficiency strategy. Ohio, Georgia, and Indiana likely offer better cost per application than national averages.

This geographic focus could be key to hitting your efficiency targets. Midwest/Southeast typically sees 15-25% lower acquisition costs than coastal markets for insurance, plus your existing policyholder concentration there strengthens lookalike performance.

Let me update our math: if geographic focus improves efficiency by 20%, your effective cost drops from $120 to $96 per application. That gets you to 7,800 applications with your $750K budget - still short of 15,000, but much closer.

What's your current budget allocation between these high-performing regions versus national spend?

Turn 9:
Excellent strategic shift. Let me model what this reallocation could deliver:

60% regional focus = $450K in high-performing markets
40% national = $300K for broader reach

If regional concentration improves efficiency by 20-25% (typical for insurance geo-focus), your regional cost per application drops to $90-96. That yields:
- Regional: 4,700-5,000 applications from $450K  
- National: 2,500 applications from $300K at $120
- Total: ~7,500 applications vs your 15,000 target

This closes your gap from 58% short to 50% short - meaningful progress, but still a significant challenge.

The math suggests you need either more budget flexibility or acceptance of a lower volume target that maximizes quality. What's more realistic: pushing for additional budget or resetting expectations around the 7,500 achievable applications?

Turn 10:
I understand your challenge, but I need to keep us focused on the foundation first. We haven't finished defining your audience strategy, which directly impacts which channels will be most effective.

You mentioned tight lookalikes from high-converting policyholders in Ohio/Georgia/Indiana. Let's define this precisely since audience quality drives efficiency more than channel selection.

From your existing policyholders in these regions, what specific profile converts best? For example:
- Age range (you mentioned 35-60, but is there a sweet spot?)
- Income level ($50K+, $75K+?)
- Household composition (married, families, empty nesters?)

The tighter we define your highest-converting audience, the better our channel recommendations will be in Step 7.

Turn 11:
Perfect profile - financially stable professionals with family protection mindset. That's a strong foundation for efficient targeting.

Let me size this audience: married homeowners aged 42-52, $85K-$125K income, with children, in Ohio/Georgia/Indiana represents roughly 800K-1.2M households. That's a solid audience size - large enough for scale but focused enough for efficiency.

This precision targeting could improve your conversion rate from 35% toward that 45-50% range, which would reduce your effective cost per issued policy significantly.

One critical question: do you want to exclude certain health risk indicators in your initial targeting, or let underwriting handle that filtering? Excluding high-risk signals upfront could improve application quality but might narrow your audience further.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 12:
Smart approach - upstream filtering reduces wasted underwriting costs and improves conversion efficiency.

With health risk exclusions, your targetable audience contracts to roughly 600K-900K households in your core regions, but application quality should jump significantly. This precision targeting could realistically push conversion from 35% to 45-48%.

At 47% conversion, your effective cost per issued policy drops from $343 to $255 - that's meaningful efficiency improvement even at $120 per application.

However, the smaller audience may limit your ability to scale to 15,000 applications. We're optimizing for quality over volume, which aligns with your goal but may require expectation management with your board.

Now let's move to budget allocation. You mentioned flipping to 60-70% regional focus. With your refined audience definition, how do you want to allocate your $750K between these high-performing regions and any remaining national reach?

Turn 13:
Excellent allocation strategy. Let me model this:

**Regional ($487,500):**
- At improved $96 efficiency from geo-focus: ~5,080 applications
- At 47% conversion: ~2,390 issued policies

**National ($262,500):**  
- Programmatic + LinkedIn targeting professionals: potentially $110-115 vs $120 baseline
- At $112 blended: ~2,345 applications
- At 42% conversion (slightly lower than regional): ~985 issued policies

**Total projection:** ~7,425 applications, ~3,375 issued policies

This is still about half your 15,000 target, but the quality focus means higher policy conversion and better lifetime value realization.

Your value proposition becomes critical here - what messaging resonates most with these financially conservative professionals? "Family protection" themes, or something more specific about their life stage and security concerns?

Turn 14:
Perfect messaging framework - "responsible provider" positioning aligns well with your target audience's mindset and values.

For your value proposition, this suggests emphasizing practical benefits: mortgage protection, education funding security, and family financial stability. This audience responds to concrete scenarios rather than abstract insurance concepts.

Your messaging should reinforce their identity as prudent planners who make smart financial decisions. "Protecting Your Family's Future, No Matter What" works because it frames insurance as responsible planning, not crisis response.

Now let's address the reality: we've modeled ~7,425 applications against your 15,000 target. You have strong audience definition, smart geographic focus, and compelling messaging, but still face a significant volume gap.

What channels are you currently using, and which have delivered your best cost per application in these target markets?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 21:
Perfect framing - you're positioning this as strategic investment, not performance decline. 

**Board memo key points:**
- Current attribution inflation means unknown ROI on $750K spend
- 6-12 week measurement investment prevents continued waste
- Refined targeting improves policy quality even at lower volume
- Clean data enables confident scaling once validated

**Expectation management:** Frame the measurement period as "building the foundation for profitable growth" rather than testing. You're not experimenting - you're implementing essential business infrastructure.

Your strategic reset transforms SecureLife from spray-and-pray marketing to precision-driven acquisition. That's exactly the kind of operational excellence boards want to see.

You've built a comprehensive plan that addresses your real challenges rather than chasing unrealistic targets. This measurement-first approach will serve SecureLife well beyond this campaign cycle.

Good luck with your board presentation - you have a strong case for sustainable growth over vanity metrics.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 15:
Based on your current mix and targeting precision, here's what I'd recommend:

**Search (40% - $300K):** Double down on your consistent performer. Expand long-tail keywords around "mortgage protection insurance" and "family income replacement" to capture your planning-minded audience.

**Programmatic Display (35% - $262K):** Use your refined audience data for lookalike targeting. Focus on financial and parenting websites where your 42-52 professionals consume content.

**Social (25% - $187K):** LinkedIn for professional targeting, Facebook for family-focused messaging. Both platforms can leverage your income and demographic filters effectively.

This allocation prioritizes your proven search performance while improving display efficiency through better targeting.

However, even with optimized channels, you're still projecting 7,425 applications vs 15,000 target. The gap suggests you need either budget flexibility or a conversation with your board about realistic volume expectations.

How will you measure success across these channels - application volume, cost per application, or conversion to issued policies?

Turn 16:
Excellent focus - cost per issued policy is the metric that truly drives business outcomes. This shifts our entire measurement framework.

**Primary KPI:** Cost per issued policy
**Secondary:** Application-to-policy conversion rate
**Leading indicators:** Application volume and cost per application

With your refined targeting, we're projecting:
- ~7,425 applications at ~$101 average cost per application  
- ~3,375 issued policies at 45% conversion rate
- **Cost per issued policy: ~$222**

At $2,800 LTV, that's a 12.6:1 return - excellent for insurance.

For measurement, you'll need:
- Platform tracking for application costs
- CRM integration for conversion tracking  
- Attribution modeling across your search/display/social mix
- Incrementality testing to validate channel performance

What's your current measurement setup? Can you track from initial click through to issued policy, or do you have attribution gaps between application and final policy issuance?

Turn 17:
That measurement gap is costing you optimization opportunities. Without channel-specific conversion tracking through to issued policies, you're optimizing on application cost rather than policy value.

**Critical measurement priorities:**
1. CRM-platform integration to track application-to-policy by source
2. Cohort analysis to identify which targeting segments convert best
3. Channel-specific policy conversion rates vs blended 35%

Quick win: implement UTM tracking with policy outcome data to identify which campaigns drive your best converters. This data becomes crucial for budget reallocation.

**Testing approach:** Start with small incrementality tests on your highest-performing channels to validate true lift vs attributed conversions.

What's your biggest measurement risk? Is it platform attribution inflation, or the inability to optimize based on final policy outcomes?

Turn 18:
Platform attribution inflation is a massive issue in insurance - you're right to prioritize this. Digital platforms routinely claim 20-40% more credit than reality.

**Immediate testing framework:**
- Geographic holdout tests: pause spend in select DMAs, measure policy impact
- Incrementality testing on your highest-volume channels first
- Media mix modeling to understand true channel contribution

Your refined targeting actually helps here - tighter audience definition makes incrementality testing more reliable.

**Risk assessment:** With 50% of budget potentially misattributed, you could be dramatically overspending on low-converting channels while underfunding high-performers.

This measurement uncertainty adds another layer to your volume challenge. Even our 7,425 application projection could be optimistic if current attribution is inflated.

Given this measurement risk and your 15,000 application target gap, what's your biggest concern moving forward - proving current channel value or finding new efficiency gains?

Turn 19:
You're absolutely right - building measurement integrity comes before any channel optimization. Without clean attribution, every strategic decision is compromised.

This creates a critical path dependency: measurement infrastructure must be your first priority, which affects timeline for hitting your 15,000 application target. Clean incrementality testing takes 6-12 weeks to generate reliable data.

**Your plan summary:**
- **Target:** 15,000 qualified applications, $750K budget
- **Reality:** ~7,425 applications achievable with current economics
- **Constraint:** Attribution inflation masking true channel performance
- **Priority:** Measurement before optimization

The gap between target and reality, combined with measurement uncertainty, suggests a strategic conversation with your board about realistic timelines and volume expectations while you build measurement capabilities.

What's more valuable: hitting volume targets with uncertain quality, or building measurement systems that enable sustainable growth?

Turn 20:
Excellent strategic thinking - you're prioritizing long-term capability over short-term metrics. This positions SecureLife for sustainable, profitable growth rather than vanity volume.

**Your complete media plan foundation:**
- **Refined targeting:** 42-52, $85K-$125K, married homeowners with children
- **Geographic focus:** 65% in Ohio/Georgia/Indiana, 35% strategic national
- **Measurement priority:** Incrementality testing and attribution validation
- **Timeline:** 6-12 weeks for clean data before major optimization
- **Success metric:** Cost per issued policy, not application volume

This plan gives you the data infrastructure to optimize confidently and the audience precision to improve conversion rates. Your board conversation should frame this as building sustainable competitive advantage through measurement excellence.

You've built a strong foundation that addresses your real business needs rather than chasing unrealistic volume targets. The measurement investment will pay dividends for years of future campaigns.

Is there anything else about this strategic approach you'd like to refine before presenting to your board?
