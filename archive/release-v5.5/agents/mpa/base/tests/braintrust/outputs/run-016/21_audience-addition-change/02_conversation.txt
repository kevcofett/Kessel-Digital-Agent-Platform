TURN 1 (Step 1)

USER:
Hi, I'm VP of Marketing at WealthPath Advisors, a wealth management firm. I need to build a media plan to generate 5,000 qualified leads with a $2M budget. Our target is high-net-worth individuals 55+ who are approaching or in retirement, with $1M+ in investable assets. LTV is around $15K per client. We focus on the top 30 wealth markets in the US.

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me immediately model your efficiency target. $2M budget ÷ 5,000 leads = $400 per qualified lead. With $15K LTV, that's a 37.5x return - very strong for wealth management where typical qualified lead costs run $300-600.

Your efficiency target is achievable and positions you well. What specific business outcome are these 5,000 qualified leads designed to achieve - new AUM growth, client acquisition, or portfolio expansion?

TURN 2 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our primary goal is AUM growth. We want to attract high-net-worth clients who can move substantial investment portfolios to WealthPath, ideally bringing $5-10M in assets under management per client. These 5,000 leads are really about finding those transformative relationships that can significantly boost our firm's overall investable assets.

AGENT:
Perfect. Let me update our model with AUM growth as your primary objective. At 5,000 leads targeting clients with $5-10M portfolios, you're projecting $25-50 billion in potential AUM - that's transformational scale.

Your primary KPI is clear: AUM growth from new client acquisition. For measurement, are you tracking total new AUM acquired, or do you have a specific AUM target from these 5,000 leads? 

Also, what's your typical conversion rate from qualified lead to signed client in this segment?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 3 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our conversion rate is around 2-3% for this high-net-worth segment. We're targeting $250-350 million in new AUM from these 5,000 leads. Right now, we don't have a precise AUM target, but we know these leads need to generate meaningful portfolio migrations that significantly impact our firm's growth trajectory.

AGENT:
Excellent. Let me model this out:

5,000 leads × 2.5% conversion = 125 new clients
$300M target AUM ÷ 125 clients = $2.4M average per client

This aligns well with your $5-10M range, though it's toward the conservative end. At $400 per lead cost and 2.5% conversion, your true acquisition cost is $16,000 per client ($400 ÷ 0.025). With $15K LTV, you're essentially break-even on direct revenue.

However, wealth management economics work differently - your real returns come from ongoing AUM fees. At typical 1% management fees, each $2.4M client generates $24K annually, making this highly profitable long-term.

Your economics are solid for wealth management. The key will be lead quality - ensuring these leads truly have the investable assets and migration intent you need. Ready to move to audience definition?

TURN 4 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Yes, absolutely. Lead quality is critical for us. We can't afford to waste time on prospects who don't have substantial investable assets. When you say "audience definition," I'm particularly interested in how we can laser-focus on those high-net-worth individuals who are most likely to be interested in wealth management services and have the capacity to move significant portfolios. What targeting strategies do you recommend?

AGENT:
Great question about targeting strategies - we'll dive deep into channels and tactics in Step 7. First, let's define your ideal audience with the precision needed for this $400-per-lead efficiency.

You mentioned HNW individuals 55+ with $1M+ investable assets. Given your $2.4M average target per client, we need to go much higher than $1M minimum. 

Let's get specific: What's the actual investable asset threshold that indicates someone could realistically bring $5-10M to WealthPath? Are we talking $3M+ liquid assets, $5M+ total investable, or higher?

This precision matters because targeting someone with $1.5M total assets versus $8M creates completely different audience pools and efficiency outcomes.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 5 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're really looking at $5M+ in total investable assets as our sweet spot. Below that threshold, clients are unlikely to move the needle on our AUM growth. Ideally, we want those UHNW individuals with $8-15M who are thinking about legacy planning, portfolio consolidation, and sophisticated wealth management strategies. Anything less feels like we're not truly targeting the transformative relationships we need.

AGENT:
Perfect. $5M+ investable assets with focus on $8-15M UHNW is much more realistic for your AUM goals. This dramatically changes our audience sizing and targeting precision.

Let me capture your key demographic and behavioral signals:

**Demographics:** 55+, $5M+ investable assets (sweet spot $8-15M)
**Behavioral:** Legacy planning interest, portfolio consolidation needs, seeking sophisticated wealth management

**Psychographic signals I'm hearing:** Decision-makers evaluating wealth management options, likely frustrated with current advisor performance or service levels, interested in comprehensive planning.

What other behavioral signals indicate someone is ready to migrate their portfolio? For example, do they typically research wealth management online, attend financial seminars, or show other specific behaviors before making advisor changes?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 6 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Those are great signals. In our experience, these high-net-worth prospects tend to be very research-driven. They'll attend wealth management webinars, download detailed white papers about retirement strategies, and often engage with financial content on platforms like LinkedIn. We've noticed they're particularly responsive to thought leadership content that demonstrates deep expertise in complex wealth preservation and tax optimization strategies.

AGENT:
Excellent behavioral insights. Let me add these research-driven signals:

**Behavioral targeting refined:**
- Webinar attendees (wealth management topics)
- White paper downloaders (retirement/tax strategies) 
- LinkedIn financial content engagement
- Thought leadership content consumption
- Tax optimization and wealth preservation research

This creates a highly targetable digital footprint. UHNW individuals who actively research create strong intent signals for platforms like LinkedIn and programmatic targeting.

One critical sizing question: In your top 30 wealth markets, what's your estimate of the total addressable audience? Are we talking 50,000 individuals who meet these criteria, 200,000, or a different scale? 

This affects whether we can be highly selective or need to expand criteria to hit 5,000 leads.

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 7 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Based on our internal market analysis and research, I'd estimate we're looking at around 125,000 to 150,000 individuals across our top 30 wealth markets who genuinely meet our $5M+ investable assets profile. That gives us enough scale to be highly selective while still having room to reach our 5,000 lead target. The key is quality over quantity - we'd rather have 5,000 laser-focused, high-potential leads than a broader pool of less qualified prospects.

AGENT:
Perfect. 125,000-150,000 qualified prospects across your 30 markets gives us excellent targeting precision. At 5,000 leads, you're only targeting 3.3-4% of this universe - allowing for highly selective criteria.

This audience scale supports sophisticated targeting strategies without exhausting your prospect pool. Quality over quantity is exactly right for wealth management.

Now let's define your geographic strategy. You mentioned top 30 wealth markets - are these traditional hubs like NYC, SF, Chicago, plus emerging markets like Austin and Nashville? And do you weight budget allocation by market size, or do you have specific AUM growth targets by region that should drive our geographic strategy?

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 8 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I need to expand our scope. After our strategy meeting, leadership wants us to also target emerging affluent young professionals - people 30-45 with $250K to $1M in investable assets. They're focused on wealth building and some are receiving inheritances from their boomer parents. This is a completely different audience than our retirees. How do we plan for both segments?

AGENT:
This creates two distinct audience segments requiring completely different strategies:

**Segment 1:** UHNW 55+ with $5M+ assets (portfolio consolidation)
**Segment 2:** Emerging affluent 30-45 with $250K-$1M assets (wealth building)

Your economics just changed significantly. Let me model this:

If we split 5,000 leads between both segments, the younger affluent will have much lower LTV - probably $2-4K versus your $15K for UHNW. This means very different efficiency targets and channel strategies.

Before we proceed, I need to understand the split: What percentage of your 5,000 leads should target each segment? And what's the expected LTV for the emerging affluent segment?

This affects everything - budget allocation, messaging, channels, and measurement approach.

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 9 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Great point. I think we should allocate 70% of our leads to the UHNW 55+ segment and 30% to the emerging affluent group. For the younger segment, we're estimating an LTV around $3-4K - much lower, but with potential long-term growth as they accumulate wealth. Our primary focus remains the high-value retiree market, but we want to start building relationships with the next generation of wealth management clients. This split allows us to maintain our core strategy while planting seeds for future growth.

AGENT:
Excellent split. Let me update our model:

**UHNW Segment:** 3,500 leads × 2.5% conversion = 88 clients at $15K LTV
**Emerging Affluent:** 1,500 leads × [need conversion rate] = ? clients at $3.5K LTV

This creates very different efficiency requirements:
- UHNW: $400 per lead with $15K LTV = strong economics
- Emerging Affluent: $400 per lead with $3.5K LTV = break-even at best

What's your typical conversion rate for the 30-45 emerging affluent segment? They likely convert differently than UHNW retirees, and this will determine if $400 per lead is realistic for both segments or if we need different efficiency targets.

Events: calculation_performed, benchmark_cited

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 10 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're estimating around 1-1.5% conversion for the emerging affluent segment. They're more likely to be in research mode and less committed to immediate wealth management transitions. We know this lower conversion means we'll need more nurturing touchpoints and potentially a different lead acquisition strategy compared to our UHNW segment. The goal is building long-term relationship potential, not immediate AUM growth.

AGENT:
Let me recalculate with your 1.25% conversion rate:

**Emerging Affluent Economics:**
1,500 leads × 1.25% = 19 clients × $3.5K LTV = $66,500 revenue
Lead cost: 1,500 × $400 = $600,000 budget allocation

This segment loses $533,500 on direct economics - a 9x negative return. You're essentially investing in future relationships at significant upfront loss.

**UHNW Economics remain strong:**
3,500 leads × 2.5% = 88 clients × $15K = $1.32M revenue vs $1.4M cost

Your blended economics work because UHNW profits subsidize emerging affluent investment. However, at $400 per lead, the younger segment needs much more efficient acquisition - closer to $100-150 per lead to be sustainable.

Should we set different efficiency targets by segment, or is this acceptable as a long-term investment strategy?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 11 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
This is exactly the strategic investment approach our leadership team has been discussing. We understand these emerging affluent leads are a long-term play - we're not expecting immediate ROI, but building a pipeline for future AUM growth. The UHNW segment essentially funds our future client acquisition strategy. I'm comfortable with the economics if we can keep acquisition costs for the emerging segment closer to $150 per lead. We'll need highly targeted, digital-first strategies that allow us to nurture these relationships cost-effectively over time.

AGENT:
Perfect. That's a much more sustainable approach. Let me model the revised efficiency targets:

**Revised Budget Allocation:**
- UHNW: 3,500 leads × $400 = $1.4M (70% of budget)
- Emerging Affluent: 1,500 leads × $150 = $225K (11% of budget) 
- Remaining: $375K for testing, creative, and optimization

**Economics Check:**
- UHNW: 88 clients × $15K = $1.32M revenue (strong)
- Emerging Affluent: 19 clients × $3.5K = $66.5K revenue (strategic investment)

This creates realistic efficiency targets for each segment and preserves budget for optimization.

Your audience definition is complete:
- **UHNW:** 55+, $5M+ assets, research-driven, consolidation-focused
- **Emerging Affluent:** 30-45, $250K-$1M assets, wealth-building, inheritance recipients

Ready to move to geography? How should we weight your top 30 markets between these two very different audience segments?

Events: calculation_performed, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 12 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our geographic strategy needs to be nuanced. For UHNW, we'll focus heavily on traditional wealth centers like New York, San Francisco, Boston, and Miami - probably 60-70% of market allocation. For emerging affluent, we want to target tech hubs and high-growth metros like Austin, Seattle, Denver, and Atlanta, which have younger professional populations with accelerating wealth accumulation. I'd recommend about 40% of our geographic targeting for emerging affluent be in these growth markets, with the remainder spread across other top-tier cities.

AGENT:
Excellent geographic segmentation. This aligns audience demographics with market characteristics perfectly.

**UHNW Geographic Strategy:**
- Traditional wealth centers (NYC, SF, Boston, Miami): 60-70% allocation
- Targeting established wealth concentration areas

**Emerging Affluent Geographic Strategy:** 
- Tech/growth hubs (Austin, Seattle, Denver, Atlanta): 40% allocation
- Remaining 60% across other top-tier cities with young professional density

This creates distinct market strategies matching where each audience naturally concentrates.

Quick validation: Are there any geographic markets where both segments overlap significantly that we should optimize for dual-targeting efficiency? Or do you prefer keeping the geographic strategies completely separate to maintain message relevance?

Also, within your $1.4M UHNW budget and $225K emerging affluent budget, should we weight allocation by market size, or do you have specific AUM growth priorities in certain metros?
