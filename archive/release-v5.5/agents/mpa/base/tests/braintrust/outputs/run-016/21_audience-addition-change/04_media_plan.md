# Media Plan Output: Audience Addition Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me immediately model your efficiency target. $2M budget ÷ 5,000 leads = $400 per qualified lead. With $15K LTV, that's a 37.5x return - very strong for wealth management where typical qualified lead costs run $300-600.

Your efficiency target is achievable and positions you well. What specific business outcome are these 5,000 qualified leads designed to achieve - new AUM growth, client acquisition, or portfolio expansion?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect. Let me update our model with AUM growth as your primary objective. At 5,000 leads targeting clients with $5-10M portfolios, you're projecting $25-50 billion in potential AUM - that's transformational scale.

Your primary KPI is clear: AUM growth from new client acquisition. For measurement, are you tracking total new AUM acquired, or do you have a specific AUM target from these 5,000 leads? 

Also, what's your typical conversion rate from qualified lead to signed client in this segment?

Turn 3:
Excellent. Let me model this out:

5,000 leads × 2.5% conversion = 125 new clients
$300M target AUM ÷ 125 clients = $2.4M average per client

This aligns well with your $5-10M range, though it's toward the conservative end. At $400 per lead cost and 2.5% conversion, your true acquisition cost is $16,000 per client ($400 ÷ 0.025). With $15K LTV, you're essentially break-even on direct revenue.

However, wealth management economics work differently - your real returns come from ongoing AUM fees. At typical 1% management fees, each $2.4M client generates $24K annually, making this highly profitable long-term.

Your economics are solid for wealth management. The key will be lead quality - ensuring these leads truly have the investable assets and migration intent you need. Ready to move to audience definition?

Turn 4:
Great question about targeting strategies - we'll dive deep into channels and tactics in Step 7. First, let's define your ideal audience with the precision needed for this $400-per-lead efficiency.

You mentioned HNW individuals 55+ with $1M+ investable assets. Given your $2.4M average target per client, we need to go much higher than $1M minimum. 

Let's get specific: What's the actual investable asset threshold that indicates someone could realistically bring $5-10M to WealthPath? Are we talking $3M+ liquid assets, $5M+ total investable, or higher?

This precision matters because targeting someone with $1.5M total assets versus $8M creates completely different audience pools and efficiency outcomes.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Perfect. $5M+ investable assets with focus on $8-15M UHNW is much more realistic for your AUM goals. This dramatically changes our audience sizing and targeting precision.

Let me capture your key demographic and behavioral signals:

**Demographics:** 55+, $5M+ investable assets (sweet spot $8-15M)
**Behavioral:** Legacy planning interest, portfolio consolidation needs, seeking sophisticated wealth management

**Psychographic signals I'm hearing:** Decision-makers evaluating wealth management options, likely frustrated with current advisor performance or service levels, interested in comprehensive planning.

What other behavioral signals indicate someone is ready to migrate their portfolio? For example, do they typically research wealth management online, attend financial seminars, or show other specific behaviors before making advisor changes?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent behavioral insights. Let me add these research-driven signals:

**Behavioral targeting refined:**
- Webinar attendees (wealth management topics)
- White paper downloaders (retirement/tax strategies) 
- LinkedIn financial content engagement
- Thought leadership content consumption
- Tax optimization and wealth preservation research

This creates a highly targetable digital footprint. UHNW individuals who actively research create strong intent signals for platforms like LinkedIn and programmatic targeting.

One critical sizing question: In your top 30 wealth markets, what's your estimate of the total addressable audience? Are we talking 50,000 individuals who meet these criteria, 200,000, or a different scale? 

This affects whether we can be highly selective or need to expand criteria to hit 5,000 leads.

Turn 7:
Perfect. 125,000-150,000 qualified prospects across your 30 markets gives us excellent targeting precision. At 5,000 leads, you're only targeting 3.3-4% of this universe - allowing for highly selective criteria.

This audience scale supports sophisticated targeting strategies without exhausting your prospect pool. Quality over quantity is exactly right for wealth management.

Now let's define your geographic strategy. You mentioned top 30 wealth markets - are these traditional hubs like NYC, SF, Chicago, plus emerging markets like Austin and Nashville? And do you weight budget allocation by market size, or do you have specific AUM growth targets by region that should drive our geographic strategy?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
This creates two distinct audience segments requiring completely different strategies:

**Segment 1:** UHNW 55+ with $5M+ assets (portfolio consolidation)
**Segment 2:** Emerging affluent 30-45 with $250K-$1M assets (wealth building)

Your economics just changed significantly. Let me model this:

If we split 5,000 leads between both segments, the younger affluent will have much lower LTV - probably $2-4K versus your $15K for UHNW. This means very different efficiency targets and channel strategies.

Before we proceed, I need to understand the split: What percentage of your 5,000 leads should target each segment? And what's the expected LTV for the emerging affluent segment?

This affects everything - budget allocation, messaging, channels, and measurement approach.

Turn 10:
Let me recalculate with your 1.25% conversion rate:

**Emerging Affluent Economics:**
1,500 leads × 1.25% = 19 clients × $3.5K LTV = $66,500 revenue
Lead cost: 1,500 × $400 = $600,000 budget allocation

This segment loses $533,500 on direct economics - a 9x negative return. You're essentially investing in future relationships at significant upfront loss.

**UHNW Economics remain strong:**
3,500 leads × 2.5% = 88 clients × $15K = $1.32M revenue vs $1.4M cost

Your blended economics work because UHNW profits subsidize emerging affluent investment. However, at $400 per lead, the younger segment needs much more efficient acquisition - closer to $100-150 per lead to be sustainable.

Should we set different efficiency targets by segment, or is this acceptable as a long-term investment strategy?

Turn 11:
Perfect. That's a much more sustainable approach. Let me model the revised efficiency targets:

**Revised Budget Allocation:**
- UHNW: 3,500 leads × $400 = $1.4M (70% of budget)
- Emerging Affluent: 1,500 leads × $150 = $225K (11% of budget) 
- Remaining: $375K for testing, creative, and optimization

**Economics Check:**
- UHNW: 88 clients × $15K = $1.32M revenue (strong)
- Emerging Affluent: 19 clients × $3.5K = $66.5K revenue (strategic investment)

This creates realistic efficiency targets for each segment and preserves budget for optimization.

Your audience definition is complete:
- **UHNW:** 55+, $5M+ assets, research-driven, consolidation-focused
- **Emerging Affluent:** 30-45, $250K-$1M assets, wealth-building, inheritance recipients

Ready to move to geography? How should we weight your top 30 markets between these two very different audience segments?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Excellent split. Let me update our model:

**UHNW Segment:** 3,500 leads × 2.5% conversion = 88 clients at $15K LTV
**Emerging Affluent:** 1,500 leads × [need conversion rate] = ? clients at $3.5K LTV

This creates very different efficiency requirements:
- UHNW: $400 per lead with $15K LTV = strong economics
- Emerging Affluent: $400 per lead with $3.5K LTV = break-even at best

What's your typical conversion rate for the 30-45 emerging affluent segment? They likely convert differently than UHNW retirees, and this will determine if $400 per lead is realistic for both segments or if we need different efficiency targets.

Turn 12:
Excellent geographic segmentation. This aligns audience demographics with market characteristics perfectly.

**UHNW Geographic Strategy:**
- Traditional wealth centers (NYC, SF, Boston, Miami): 60-70% allocation
- Targeting established wealth concentration areas

**Emerging Affluent Geographic Strategy:** 
- Tech/growth hubs (Austin, Seattle, Denver, Atlanta): 40% allocation
- Remaining 60% across other top-tier cities with young professional density

This creates distinct market strategies matching where each audience naturally concentrates.

Quick validation: Are there any geographic markets where both segments overlap significantly that we should optimize for dual-targeting efficiency? Or do you prefer keeping the geographic strategies completely separate to maintain message relevance?

Also, within your $1.4M UHNW budget and $225K emerging affluent budget, should we weight allocation by market size, or do you have specific AUM growth priorities in certain metros?
