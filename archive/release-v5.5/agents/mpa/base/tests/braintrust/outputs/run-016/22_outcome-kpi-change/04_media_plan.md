# Media Plan Output: Outcome KPI Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by confirming your business outcome. You want 25,000 new policy acquisitions - is this your primary objective, or are there other business outcomes like retention improvement or cross-selling existing customers that factor into this campaign?

Turn 2:
Perfect. With 25,000 new policy acquisitions as your primary objective, let me model the economics immediately.

$5M ÷ 25,000 = $200 per acquisition. With $2,800 LTV, that's a 14:1 LTV:CAC ratio - extremely healthy for insurance where 3-5:1 is typical.

This efficiency target is very achievable. Insurance typically runs $150-400 CAC depending on coverage type, so $200 puts you in the conservative range with strong unit economics.

Your success metric is clear: 25,000 new policies. Is there a specific timeline for achieving this target - are we looking at a 12-month campaign, or a different timeframe?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent. 2,083 policies per month gives us clear pacing targets. At $200 CAC with $2,800 LTV, your unit economics are rock solid for sustained growth.

Step 1 complete - we have your objective, KPI, and volume target with realistic efficiency.

Moving to Step 2 Economics validation: You mentioned homeowners 35-65 with $100K+ income during life transitions. For insurance, these high-intent moments typically convert 2-4x better than general prospecting. 

Given your $2,800 LTV, what's your typical gross margin per policy? This helps us understand how much acquisition investment you can sustain while maintaining profitability targets.

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using 42.5% gross margin based on typical insurance benchmarks. You can refine anytime with finance team input.

At 42.5% margin on $2,800 LTV = $1,190 gross profit per policy. With $200 CAC, you're investing 17% of gross profit in acquisition - very conservative. Most insurers can sustain 30-40% of gross profit for acquisition, giving you significant headroom.

Your economics are solid: $200 CAC is achievable for your target audience, and the unit economics support sustainable growth.

Moving to Step 3 - Audience: You mentioned homeowners 35-65, $100K+ income, during life transitions. Life events create 3-5x higher conversion rates in insurance. Which of these life events - home purchase, new baby, or approaching retirement - converts best for your current book of business?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Perfect. Home purchases create urgency and high intent - new homeowners typically secure insurance within 30-60 days of closing.

For audience precision, I need to understand your targeting depth. Are you able to identify recent home buyers through data partnerships (like property records), or are you targeting broader homeowner signals like mortgage applications, real estate browsing, or moving-related behaviors?

The data source affects both audience size and conversion rates significantly.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Got it. Broader signals like mortgage applications and real estate browsing give you larger audience pools but lower conversion rates than recent buyer data.

For 25,000 acquisitions, you'll need substantial audience reach. With broader homeowner signals, assume 0.5-1.5% conversion rates vs 3-5% for recent buyers.

At 1% conversion rate, you'd need 2.5M qualified prospects annually. That's roughly 200K monthly reach across your target demographics.

Before we size this further - are you planning to target nationally, or do you have specific states/regions where TrustGuard is licensed and competitive? Geographic scope dramatically affects audience availability and media costs.

Turn 8:
This is a significant strategic pivot that changes everything we've modeled. Let me recalibrate.

**New Objective Analysis:**
- Primary goal: 15% brand awareness lift (defensive positioning)
- Target: Same homeowner demographic (35-65, $100K+, core markets)
- Budget: Still $5M
- Timeline: Still 12 months

**Economic Impact:**
Brand awareness campaigns operate on completely different metrics than acquisition. Instead of $200 CAC, we're now looking at cost per impression, reach, and frequency targets.

**Critical Question:** When you say "15% brand awareness lift," do you mean:
1. Increase aided brand awareness from current baseline by 15 percentage points, or
2. Achieve 15% total aided awareness in your target demographic?

The baseline matters enormously - going from 10% to 25% awareness requires different investment than achieving 15% from zero.

Turn 9:
Got it. Moving from 8-10% to 23-25% aided awareness is a 15+ percentage point lift - that's substantial brand building requiring significant reach and frequency.

**Economics Reality Check:**
$5M for 15+ point awareness lift across your target demo in core markets is aggressive but achievable. Insurance brand campaigns typically need $2-5 per person reached to drive meaningful awareness shifts.

**Immediate Issue:** Without baseline measurement, you can't prove success. Before we design the media mix, you need brand tracking in place to measure lift.

Since this is now a completely different campaign type, should we restart our planning process focused on brand objectives? The audience, geography, and measurement approaches will be fundamentally different from acquisition planning.

Or do you want to continue with our current 10-step process but pivot each step toward brand awareness goals?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Excellent. Your core markets - Northeast, Florida, Texas, and California - represent roughly 45% of US homeowners, which aligns well with your 60% business concentration.

For audience sizing: In your core markets, you're looking at approximately 15M households meeting your 35-65, $100K+ homeowner profile. With broader targeting signals, this gives you substantial reach for your 25,000 annual target.

Geographic allocation question: Given your stronger performance in core markets, are you thinking roughly 60-70% budget concentration in Northeast/FL/TX/CA with the remainder for expansion markets, or do you want a more balanced national approach?

This affects both audience targeting precision and cost efficiency planning.

Turn 10:
Excellent. Let's pivot to brand awareness with speed as the priority.

**Step 1 Complete - Revised Objective:**
15+ point aided awareness lift (8-10% to 23-25%) in 12 months, $5M budget, defending against competitor entry.

**Step 2 - Brand Economics:**
At $5M for ~15M target households in core markets, you're at $0.33 per household. For meaningful brand lift, you typically need $2-5 per person reached with sufficient frequency. This suggests either:
- Tighter geographic focus, or
- Audience refinement, or  
- Adjusted expectations

**Critical Path Question:** Given the competitive urgency, should we concentrate the $5M in your strongest 2-3 markets for maximum impact, or maintain national coverage but accept lighter frequency and potentially smaller awareness lift?

This decision drives everything - measurement design, channel selection, and timeline.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Perfect allocation strategy. Let me model the economics:

**Budget Allocation:**
- 70% ($3.5M) across Northeast, FL, CA = ~6M households
- 30% ($1.5M) national expansion = ~9M households  
- Core markets: $3.5M ÷ 6M = $0.58 per household
- Expansion: $1.5M ÷ 9M = $0.17 per household

**Reality Check:** $0.58 per household in core markets is still below the $2-5 needed for strong awareness lift. You'll need high-impact channels and strategic frequency concentration.

**Step 3 - Audience Refinement:** 
With budget constraints, should we tighten the demographic further? For example, focus on 35-55 (prime home-buying years) instead of 35-65, or increase income threshold to $150K+ for higher-value prospects who are more likely to switch insurers?

Audience refinement could improve your per-household investment significantly.

Turn 12:
Excellent refinement. Let me recalculate with tighter targeting:

**Revised Economics:**
- 35-55, $150K+ income reduces target audience by ~60%
- Core markets: ~2.4M households (vs 6M)
- National expansion: ~3.6M households (vs 9M)
- Core investment: $3.5M ÷ 2.4M = $1.46 per household
- Expansion investment: $1.5M ÷ 3.6M = $0.42 per household

Much better! $1.46 per household in core markets approaches viable brand awareness thresholds.

**Step 4 - Geography Validation:**
Within Northeast, FL, CA - are there specific metro areas where you're strongest? For example, focusing on Boston, NYC, Miami, Tampa, LA, SF metro areas versus broader state coverage could push your core market efficiency above $2 per household.

Should we concentrate further geographically, or does defending the entire state footprint matter strategically against this competitor?

Turn 13:
Perfect metro concentration strategy. Let me recalculate with key metros:

**Revised Geographic Economics:**
- Core metros: NYC, Boston, Philly, Miami, Tampa, LA, Bay Area
- Target households in these metros: ~1.2M (35-55, $150K+)
- Core allocation: $3.5M ÷ 1.2M = $2.92 per household
- National expansion: $1.5M ÷ 3.6M = $0.42 per household

Excellent! $2.92 per household in core metros hits the sweet spot for meaningful brand awareness lift.

**Step 5 - Budget Validation:**
This concentration gives you viable economics for 15+ point awareness lift in your strongest markets. The $5M budget works with this refined targeting.

**Step 6 - Value Proposition Development:**
Against a major competitor's brand campaign, what's your key differentiator? Are you positioning on trust/stability, local expertise, customer service, or price competitiveness? 

Your brand message needs to cut through their noise and reinforce why prospects should choose TrustGuard.
