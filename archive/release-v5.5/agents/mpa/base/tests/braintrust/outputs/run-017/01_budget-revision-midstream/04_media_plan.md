# Media Plan Output: Budget Revision Midstream

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business outcome. You mentioned targeting 10,000 new customers - is customer acquisition your primary objective, or are you also focused on other outcomes like brand awareness or market expansion?

Turn 2:
Perfect. Customer acquisition as your primary objective gives us clear direction. 

With 10,000 customers as your target and $500K budget, that implies $50 per customer acquisition cost. Given your $2,400 LTV, that's a 48:1 LTV:CAC ratio - extremely strong unit economics that gives us significant flexibility.

However, $50 CAC is quite aggressive for B2B SaaS. Industry benchmarks typically run $200-800 depending on deal size and sales cycle. To hit $50, we'd need exceptional targeting precision and channel efficiency.

What's your typical deal size or annual contract value for these new customers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
That's helpful context. Your 5,000 trial users are valuable for lookalike modeling, and the hybrid sales model means we can optimize for both trial sign-ups and sales-qualified leads.

However, the math still presents a challenge. Even with strong first-party data for targeting, $50 CAC in B2B SaaS typically requires either:
1. Very short sales cycles (under 30 days)
2. Exceptional organic conversion rates
3. Significant budget increase to ~$2M-4M for realistic $200-400 CAC

Your confidence in the product is great, but market dynamics for reaching analytics decision-makers are expensive regardless of product quality.

What's your current trial-to-customer conversion rate, and what's the typical sales cycle length from trial to closed deal?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it. With $5,000 ACV, your $2,400 LTV suggests about a 6-month payback period, which is solid for SaaS.

However, we need to address the efficiency gap. At $50 CAC for mid-market B2B SaaS targeting analytics teams, you're aiming for 75-85% below typical benchmarks ($200-400 for this segment). 

For context: reaching decision-makers at 100-1000 employee companies typically requires higher CPMs due to audience scarcity and longer consideration cycles.

Do you have strong first-party data (existing customer lists, website visitors, trial users) that we could leverage for lookalike targeting? And what's your current sales process - is this purely self-serve or sales-assisted?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Exactly. Let me show you the math: 12-15% trial conversion means you need 67,000-83,000 trials to hit 10,000 customers. At $500K budget, that's $6-7.50 per trial - which is actually achievable for B2B SaaS trial generation.

The real CAC becomes: $500K ÷ 10,000 customers = $50 for media spend alone. But this excludes sales team costs, which typically add $150-300 per customer in your segment.

Your blended CAC is likely $200-350 when including sales costs - much more realistic for mid-market B2B SaaS.

Should we reframe this as a trial generation campaign targeting 70,000 trials at ~$7 cost per trial, knowing your sales team converts 12-15% to customers? This makes your media efficiency target much more achievable.

Turn 7:
Perfect decision. $100 CAC gives us much better positioning. $750K ÷ $100 = 7,500 customers projected, which is 75% of your 10,000 target. 

This creates a clear framework: hit $100 CAC efficiency and you deliver 7,500 customers. Beat it significantly, and you approach the 10,000 stretch goal.

At $100 CAC with 12-15% trial conversion, we need ~50,000-62,500 trials at $12-15 per trial. This budget level per trial allows for:
- Multi-channel testing across LinkedIn, Google, and potentially programmatic
- Proper retargeting sequences for your 45-60 day sales cycle
- Lookalike expansion from your 5,000 trial users

Economics are now realistic. Ready to move to Step 3 and define your target audience beyond "analytics teams at 100-1000 employee companies"?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent! Let me update our projections. $750K ÷ 10,000 customers = $75 per customer acquisition cost.

At $75 CAC, you're now targeting 62-81% below typical benchmarks instead of 85%. Still aggressive, but much more achievable - especially with your strong first-party data for lookalike targeting.

For trial generation: 70,000 trials at $750K = ~$10.75 per trial. This gives us meaningful budget per channel to optimize effectively, rather than spreading too thin.

The extra $250K also provides flexibility for:
- Testing premium channels that reach analytics decision-makers
- Building stronger retargeting funnels from your trial users
- A/B testing creative approaches for your 45-60 day sales cycle

Are you comfortable targeting $75 CAC as our efficiency benchmark, or should we model a more conservative $100-125 range given the market realities?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Great question. For analytics teams at mid-market companies, we need to identify the specific decision-makers and influencers in your 45-60 day sales cycle.

Looking at your existing 2,000 customers and 5,000 trial users, what job titles are most common among your highest-converting prospects? Are we primarily reaching:

- Analytics Directors/Managers who own the buying decision
- Data Scientists/Analysts who influence and use the tool daily  
- IT/Engineering leaders who evaluate technical requirements
- Marketing/Operations VPs who sponsor analytics initiatives

Understanding which personas convert best from your first-party data will help us prioritize targeting and messaging for the most efficient path to that $100 CAC.

Turn 9:
Excellent. Analytics Directors and Data Scientists as your primary converters gives us sharp targeting focus. 60% trial share from these two personas means we should allocate the majority of budget there.

Now let's get more specific about company characteristics. Within your 100-1000 employee range, are there particular:

- Industries that convert better (tech, e-commerce, financial services, healthcare)?
- Company growth stages (scaling startups, established mid-market, enterprise divisions)?
- Tech stack indicators (companies using specific analytics tools, data warehouses, or business intelligence platforms)?

This precision helps us move beyond basic firmographic targeting to identify companies most likely to need sophisticated analytics solutions like yours.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Perfect targeting intelligence. Tech and e-commerce at 200-500 employees using Snowflake/Looker/Tableau creates a highly qualified audience profile. These companies already invest in analytics infrastructure and understand the category.

This precision targeting actually supports your aggressive $100 CAC goal - we're focusing on warm audiences who convert at higher rates rather than broad cold prospecting.

Let me size this audience roughly: Analytics Directors and Data Scientists at 200-500 employee tech/e-commerce companies using modern data stacks represents maybe 15,000-25,000 targetable professionals in major markets.

For geography, are you targeting specific regions? US-only, North America, or do you have international expansion plans? Your targeting precision suggests we should focus geographically as well to maximize efficiency.

Turn 11:
Perfect. North America focus with emphasis on major tech hubs gives us geographic precision that supports the $100 CAC target. SF Bay Area, NYC, Boston, Seattle, plus Toronto and Vancouver for Canada creates concentrated targeting.

These metros have high concentrations of your ideal 200-500 employee tech/e-commerce companies, which means better ad auction efficiency and lower CPMs than broad national targeting.

Quick audience sizing check: Analytics Directors and Data Scientists at tech/e-commerce companies (200-500 employees) using modern data stacks in these 6 metro areas likely represents 8,000-12,000 targetable professionals. That's a focused but sufficiently large pool for your 50,000-62,500 trial target.

Ready to move to Step 5 and discuss budget allocation? We'll need to balance investment across these metros and potentially test broader reach if initial audience proves too narrow.
