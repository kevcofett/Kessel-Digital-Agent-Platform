# Media Plan Output: Volume Target Increase

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business outcome. You mentioned acquiring 5,000 new customers - is customer acquisition your primary objective, or are you also focused on revenue targets or other business goals?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Customer acquisition as your primary objective makes sense for building market presence. 

Now let's define how you'll measure success. For tracking those 5,000 new customers, what's your primary KPI - is it total new customers acquired, or do you have a specific metric like cost per acquisition that you use to gauge campaign performance?

Turn 3:
Excellent. Let me check your math: $400K budget ÷ 5,000 customers = $80 per customer. That aligns perfectly with your CAC target.

With your $320 LTV and $80 CAC target, you're looking at a 4:1 LTV to CAC ratio, which is strong for home goods. Industry benchmarks typically show $60-100 CAC for home décor/furniture, so your $80 target sits right in the sweet spot - aggressive enough to drive growth but realistic for the category.

This efficiency target looks achievable. Ready to move to defining your target audience?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 4:
Great start on your audience definition. That 30-55 homeowner segment is solid for home goods. 

To help refine this further - within that broad group of homeowners interested in home décor, are there specific life moments or behaviors that make someone more likely to purchase? For example, recent movers, new homeowners, people renovating, or those with specific style preferences?

This will help us identify the highest-intent segments within your broader audience.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Perfect! A national approach maximizes your reach and leverages your shipping capabilities.

Let me model your audience sizing. With 130M+ US households and your targeting (homeowners 30-55, recent buyers/renovators, professionals upgrading), you're looking at roughly 15-20M households in your addressable market nationwide. That's a healthy audience size for your 5,000 customer target.

Now for budget allocation - you have $400K total. Do you want to allocate this evenly across all markets, or do you have preferences for how to distribute spend geographically? Some brands focus more budget on high-population metros versus smaller markets.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Excellent - recent homeowners, renovators, and professionals upgrading spaces are high-intent segments with clear purchase motivation. That gives us strong behavioral targeting signals.

For geography, are you targeting nationwide, or do you focus on specific regions? Home goods can have shipping considerations and regional style preferences, so understanding your geographic scope will help optimize the plan.

Turn 7:
Smart allocation - focusing 60-70% on high-population metros where your target demographics concentrate. That's $240K-280K for top metros, with $120K-160K for broader national reach.

This geographic strategy aligns well with your audience profile. Metro areas typically have higher home goods CACs ($80-120) but also higher LTV due to income levels, so your $80 target should be very achievable in secondary markets and competitive in primary metros.

Now let's define your value proposition. What makes HomeStyle Direct different from competitors like Wayfair, West Elm, or other home goods retailers? What's your key selling point that resonates with those recent homeowners and renovators?

Turn 8:
Let me update our projections. $400K ÷ 8,000 = $50 per customer. That's 37.5% more efficient than your original $80 target.

At $50 CAC versus the $60-100 industry benchmark, you're targeting 17-50% below typical rates. This is aggressive for home goods and will require exceptional execution.

To hit $50 CAC, you'd need either:
- Tighter audience targeting (focus only on highest-intent recent movers)
- Increased budget to ~$640K to maintain your realistic $80 efficiency
- Mix of both: partial budget increase + refined targeting

Which direction makes more sense - pushing for a budget increase to match the volume goal, or working with tighter targeting to hit the aggressive efficiency?

Turn 9:
Absolutely. Let me model the $600K scenario: $600K ÷ 8,000 = $75 per customer. That's much more realistic - only 6% below your original $80 target and well within the $60-100 industry range.

This positions you for success: aggressive growth target with achievable efficiency. Your LTV:CAC ratio stays strong at 4.3:1 ($320 ÷ $75).

For your leadership pitch, the math is compelling: 60% more customers for 50% more budget delivers better unit economics than trying to force $50 CAC with the original budget.

With $600K and clearer efficiency targets, shall we continue building your value proposition? What makes HomeStyle Direct different from competitors like Wayfair or West Elm for those recent homeowners and renovators?

Turn 10:
Excellent positioning! "Curated design guidance vs. overwhelming inventory" is a compelling value prop that directly addresses a real pain point. That resonates perfectly with busy professionals and new homeowners who want style but lack time or confidence to pull it together.

This differentiation also supports your efficiency targets - customers seeking guidance typically have higher intent and conversion rates than browsers, which helps justify your $75 CAC goal.

Now let's move to channels. With your $600K budget, 8,000 customer target, and curation-focused value prop, which digital channels are you considering? Are you thinking Meta and Google as primaries, or do you have other platforms in mind for reaching recent homeowners and renovators?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Excellent channel selection! Meta, Pinterest, and Google Shopping create a strong funnel - Pinterest for design inspiration, Meta for targeting recent movers/renovators, and Google Shopping for high-intent purchase moments.

For your $600K budget targeting $75 CAC, let me model a strategic allocation:
- Pinterest: 40% ($240K) - aligns perfectly with your curation value prop
- Meta: 35% ($210K) - precise targeting for recent homeowners
- Google Shopping: 25% ($150K) - captures bottom-funnel intent

This mix emphasizes Pinterest's design discovery strength while maintaining performance channels. Pinterest typically runs $60-90 CAC for home goods, Meta $70-100, Google Shopping $50-80.

Does this allocation align with your thinking, or would you prefer different emphasis across these three channels?

Turn 12:
Great question about creative strategy! We'll dive deep into creative approaches in our testing phase (Step 9), but let me note that showcasing your style packages will be crucial across all three channels.

For now, let's establish how you'll measure success. With your multi-channel approach, what's your plan for tracking that $75 CAC across Pinterest, Meta, and Google Shopping? Are you using a specific attribution model, or do you have measurement tools in place to track cross-channel customer journeys?

This is critical since design discovery on Pinterest might influence a purchase through Google Shopping later.
