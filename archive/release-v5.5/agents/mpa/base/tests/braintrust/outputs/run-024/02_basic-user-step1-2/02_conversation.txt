TURN 1 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Hi! I'm looking to get more people to buy shoes from our online store. Can you help me figure out the best way to do that?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What business outcome are you trying to achieve? Are you looking to get more customers, increase sales from existing customers, or something else?

TURN 2 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We definitely want to get more customers buying our shoes. Right now, our online sales are okay, but we want to grow and reach more people who might be interested in our brand. I want to increase our customer base and boost overall sales.

AGENT:
Perfect! Growing your customer base through new customer acquisition is a clear objective.

Now I need to understand how you'll measure success. What number would tell you this campaign worked? For example, are you targeting a specific number of new customers, or a sales revenue amount?

TURN 3 (Step 3)

USER:
I'm not totally sure about the exact numbers, but I know we want to see significant growth. Maybe something like 20% more customers or around $500,000 in additional online sales this year? I want to make sure we're reaching more people who might love our shoes.

AGENT:
Got it! Let me work with $500,000 in additional sales as your target - that gives us something concrete to plan around.

To build a realistic plan, I need to understand what a typical customer is worth to you. What's your average order value when someone buys shoes from your store?

TURN 4 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I'm not entirely sure of our exact average order value. I think most of our shoes range from $80 to $120, so maybe around $100 per order? But I'll be honest, I'd have to double-check with our finance team to get a precise number.

AGENT:
No problem! I'll model using $100 average order value - you can adjust that anytime. 

So $500,000 ÷ $100 = 5,000 new customers needed.

Now, what budget are you working with to acquire these 5,000 customers?

TURN 5 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We have about $250,000 to spend on marketing this year. I hope that's enough to help us reach those new customers and hit our sales targets. What do you think?

AGENT:
Let me run the numbers. $250,000 budget ÷ 5,000 customers = $50 per customer to acquire.

That's quite aggressive for shoe retail - the market typically shows $60-100 per customer based on industry benchmarks. At $50, you're targeting about 17% better efficiency than typical. 

This is ambitious but achievable with tight targeting and strong execution. To hit this target, we'll need precise audience definition and efficient channel selection.

Does $50 per customer feel realistic based on what you've seen, or should we adjust either the budget or customer target?

TURN 6 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Those numbers sound complicated, but if you think we can do it, I'm willing to try. I trust that you know the industry standards. We really want to grow, so if you believe $50 per customer is doable, let's go for it. What do we need to do next to make this happen?

AGENT:
Perfect! I like your ambition. To hit $50 per customer when typical is $60-100, we need to be smart about who we target.

Let's define your ideal customer. When you think about your best shoe customers - the ones who buy and love your products - how would you describe them? Are they mostly men or women, what age range, and what are they like?
