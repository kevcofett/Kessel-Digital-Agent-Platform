# Media Plan Output: High-Stakes Performance Campaign

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect - you've given me strong economics data upfront. Let me validate the efficiency target: $2M ÷ 50,000 = $40 CAC. With $850 LTV, that's a 21x return - excellent unit economics.

For fintech merchant acquisition, $40 CAC is aggressive. Typical runs $60-120 based on industry benchmarks. To hit $40, we'll need precise targeting.

What specific business outcome drives this 50,000 merchant target? Revenue growth, market expansion, or investor milestones?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Excellent - the math aligns perfectly. 50,000 merchants × $840 ARR = $42M, hitting your board target.

Your $40 CAC against $850 LTV creates strong unit economics, but you're right about needing surgical precision. At 33% below typical fintech CAC, we'll need tight audience definition and channel efficiency.

For measuring success, what's your primary KPI? New merchant sign-ups, or do you track a different conversion point like qualified applications or activated accounts?

Turn 3:
Perfect - qualified merchant applications as your primary KPI ensures we're driving quality over quantity. That conversion focus supports hitting your aggressive $40 CAC.

Since your sales team handles nurturing, what's your typical conversion rate from qualified application to activated merchant? This helps us model the full funnel and ensure 50,000 qualified apps actually delivers your 50,000 activated merchants target.

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using 45% conversion rate based on your range. That means we need ~111,000 qualified applications to deliver 50,000 activated merchants. This changes our efficiency target: $2M ÷ 111,000 = $18 per qualified application.

At $18 per MQL, you're in excellent territory for B2B fintech. We can refine this anytime as your conversion data improves.

Your Step 1 economics are solid. Now let's define your ideal merchant profile. What business characteristics define your best-converting merchants - industry type, revenue size, transaction volume, or other signals?

Turn 5:
Perfect audience definition. Digitally-savvy SMBs with $10K-$100K monthly volume in retail, professional services, and e-commerce - that's a targetable profile.

The 2-3 year operating window is smart - past startup survival but pre-enterprise solutions. "Looking to professionalize payment infrastructure" suggests pain point messaging around growth bottlenecks.

Are there specific business behaviors or digital signals that indicate this professionalization mindset? For example, businesses already using multiple software tools, seeking business loans, or showing other growth indicators?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent behavioral signals - QuickBooks/Xero users and Shopify/WooCommerce merchants show clear intent to professionalize. Recent business credit registrations are brilliant timing indicators.

Your current LinkedIn B2B and Google in-market approach makes sense for reaching these segments. At your aggressive $18 per qualified application target, precise audience layering will be critical.

What geographic markets are you prioritizing? Are you focusing nationally, specific regions, or particular metro areas where your payment infrastructure performs best?

Turn 7:
Smart geographic strategy. Core metros for scale, secondary markets for growth - those expansion cities have strong SMB ecosystems and digital adoption.

National coverage with concentrated spend in high-opportunity DMAs maximizes efficiency. At your $18 per qualified app target, metro concentration should deliver better performance than broad national dispersion.

Now let's validate your $2M budget allocation. You mentioned this is for next year - is this allocated quarterly, or do you have flexibility to weight spending toward high-performance periods or market opportunities?
