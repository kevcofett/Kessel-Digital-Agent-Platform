# Media Plan Output: Brand Building with Limited Data

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

For GreenLeaf's West Coast launch with brand awareness goals - what specific business outcome are you trying to achieve? Are you looking to drive store visits, online sales, lead generation, or something else measurable within that $500K investment?

Turn 2:
Perfect - online sales from health-conscious millennials and Gen Z. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success.

What's your primary number for tracking success? Are you focused on total customers acquired, total revenue generated, or a specific product volume target with this $500K?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 5:
Perfect. I'll model using 3.5 months average subscription length based on your estimate. That gives us:

$85 first order × 3.5 months = $298 customer lifetime value
$200 acquisition cost vs $298 LTV = 1.5x return

This is conservative but workable for a market entry. Most wellness brands target 2-3x LTV/CAC ratios, so you have room to improve efficiency or extend retention.

Your economics foundation is set. Now let's define your target audience. You mentioned health-conscious millennials and Gen Z - what age range specifically are you targeting?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it. I'll model using 2,500 customers as the midpoint target. You can adjust anytime as you finalize specifics.

$500K budget ÷ 2,500 customers = $200 per customer acquisition cost. For natural supplements, this is quite aggressive - the market typically shows $80-150 per customer based on industry benchmarks. 

To hit $200 efficiency in wellness, we'd need either higher-value customers or very precise targeting. What's the typical order value for your supplement purchases?

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using $85 average order value based on your range. You can refine anytime.

At $200 cost per customer with $85 order value, you'd need customers to be profitable beyond their first purchase to make this work. For supplement subscriptions, this is actually common - the lifetime value comes from repeat purchases over months.

Do you have any sense of how long customers typically stay subscribed, or should I model using wellness industry benchmarks for customer lifetime value?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Great - 25-40 year olds focused on wellness and natural health. To size this audience properly, I need a few more targeting signals.

Are you targeting both men and women equally, or does your product line skew toward a particular gender?

Turn 7:
Perfect - 60% female, 40% male split for 25-40 year olds interested in wellness.

Beyond age and gender, what other characteristics define your ideal customer? For example, are you targeting specific income levels, lifestyle interests, or behaviors that indicate someone would be interested in natural supplements?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Excellent profile - urban professionals earning $75-120K who are into fitness/wellness and follow health influencers. That gives us strong targeting precision.

For geography, you mentioned California, Oregon, and Washington. Are you targeting the entire states, or focusing on specific metro areas like LA, San Francisco, Seattle, and Portland where your urban professional audience concentrates?

Turn 9:
Perfect - LA, San Francisco, Seattle, and Portland metros. These markets align well with your target audience and have strong wellness adoption rates.

Now for budget allocation. With your $500K total budget, how are you thinking about dividing this across the four metro areas? Should we weight it by market size, or do you have specific priorities like starting stronger in California versus the Pacific Northwest?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Smart allocation - prioritizing California's larger markets while maintaining West Coast presence. That gives us:

- LA: $150K (30%)
- San Francisco: $100K (20%) 
- Seattle: $75K (15%)
- Portland: $75K (15%)

This targets roughly 625 customers in LA, 400 in SF, and 300 each in Seattle/Portland at your $200 efficiency target.

Now let's develop your value proposition. For health-conscious millennials and Gen Z choosing between supplement brands, what makes GreenLeaf Wellness different from competitors like Ritual, Care/of, or other direct-to-consumer wellness brands?

Turn 11:
Excellent positioning - organic, sustainable, targeted wellness solutions with transparency. That resonates strongly with your audience's values around natural health and environmental consciousness.

For messaging, should we emphasize the scientific research backing, the environmental sustainability, or the targeted nature of your supplement packages? What aspect typically resonates most when you're explaining GreenLeaf to potential customers?

Turn 12:
Perfect - research-backed, targeted wellness solutions for young professionals. That message connects both efficacy and relevance to their lifestyle.

Now let's build your channel strategy. With $500K for brand awareness leading to online sales across four metros, targeting health-conscious professionals aged 25-40 who follow wellness influencers and are active on social media - which channels are you considering, or should I recommend a mix based on your audience and objectives?
