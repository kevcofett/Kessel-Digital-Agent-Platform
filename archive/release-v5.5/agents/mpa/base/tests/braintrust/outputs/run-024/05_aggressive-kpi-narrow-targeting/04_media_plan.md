# Media Plan Output: Aggressive KPI - Must Narrow to Achieve

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me validate your efficiency target first. $750K / 5,000 customers = $150 CAC exactly. With $2,400 LTV, that's a 16x return - strong unit economics.

For B2B SaaS logistics, typical CAC runs $200-400 based on benchmarks. Your $150 target is 25-62% more efficient than market standard. This is aggressive but achievable with precise targeting of your pain point audience.

Your primary objective is customer acquisition with 5,000 new customers as the volume KPI. Before we dive into audience precision, what's the business timeline for hitting these 5,000 customers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect. 5,000 customers over 12 months with 45-60 day sales cycles means we need consistent MQL flow starting immediately. Your Q1-Q2 focus aligns well with B2B budget cycles.

At $150 CAC with typical B2B conversion rates, you'll need roughly 15,000-20,000 MQLs annually (assuming 25-33% MQL-to-customer conversion). That's 1,250-1,665 MQLs monthly.

Your efficiency target is 25% better than typical B2B SaaS logistics benchmarks. To hit $150 CAC in a market that typically runs $200-300, we'll need exceptional targeting precision on your SMB logistics manager audience.

**Step 1 Complete: Customer acquisition objective, 5,000 volume target, 12-month timeline**

Moving to economics - you mentioned $2,400 LTV. What's the revenue model behind that LTV? Is that based on average contract value and retention, or a specific customer segment?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Let me validate those economics. $200/month × 14-16 months = $2,800-3,200 base LTV before upsells. Your $2,400 figure is actually conservative - good for planning.

At $150 CAC vs $2,400 LTV, you're targeting 16x return with 6.25% payback period (45 days to close + first month). That's healthy unit economics even if retention drops to 12 months.

Your subscription model supports the aggressive $150 CAC since you recover costs quickly and have upsell runway. The 45-60 day sales cycle means MQLs convert within quarter, supporting your Q1-Q2 acceleration plan.

**Step 2 Complete: $150 CAC validated as aggressive but achievable with $2,400 conservative LTV**

Now for audience precision. You mentioned SMB logistics managers at 50-500 employee companies with $5M-$50M revenue, stuck on spreadsheets/legacy TMS. 

What specific pain points trigger these managers to actively seek solutions like yours?

Turn 4:
Excellent - operational bottlenecks impacting growth is a strong trigger event. That pain point creates urgency and justifies budget allocation.

Your audience has clear behavioral signals: companies experiencing rapid growth stress, manual tracking processes, customer satisfaction issues from logistics delays, and decision-makers researching "logistics software" or "TMS alternatives."

For targeting precision at $150 CAC, we need 15-20 audience signals. You've given me solid firmographic (50-500 employees, $5M-$50M revenue) and behavioral (spreadsheet-dependent, growth bottlenecks) foundations.

What industries within logistics see this pain most acutely? Manufacturing, distribution, e-commerce fulfillment, freight brokerage, or others?

Turn 5:
Perfect targeting clarity. E-commerce fulfillment and distribution at $5M-$25M revenue is your highest-intent segment - they have acute pain, budget urgency, and faster decision cycles than manufacturing.

Your core audience: E-commerce/distribution companies, $5M-$25M revenue, 50-500 employees, scaling rapidly but logistics efficiency isn't keeping pace, researching TMS solutions or "logistics software," experiencing margin pressure from operational inefficiency.

Secondary: Similar profile in manufacturing with less urgency.

**Step 3 Complete: High-precision audience targeting E-commerce/distribution SMBs**

Now geography. B2B SaaS can target nationally, but some regions have higher concentrations of your target companies. Are there specific metros or regions where e-commerce/distribution density is highest, or do you have any geographic performance data from existing customers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Smart concentration strategy. Top 10-15 metros with 70% of your existing base provides clear targeting focus and higher conversion likelihood.

Your priority DMAs: Bay Area, Seattle, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, plus likely NYC, LA, Denver, Austin, Miami for logistics density. This geographic focus supports your aggressive $150 CAC by avoiding waste in lower-intent markets.

**Step 4 Complete: Tier 1 metro concentration strategy**

Budget allocation time. You have $750K total. Industry practice suggests 60-70% for acquisition channels, 15-20% for retention/expansion, 10-15% for testing new channels, 5-10% contingency.

At 65% acquisition focus: $487K for new customer acquisition across your tier 1 metros. Does this allocation match your growth priorities, or do you want different splits between acquisition, retention, and testing?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 7:
Excellent - 70% acquisition focus aligns with your aggressive growth targets. $525K for new customer acquisition, $112.5K retention, $75K testing, $37.5K contingency.

Your $525K acquisition budget targeting 5,000 customers = $105 acquisition budget per customer. That's $45 cushion below your $150 CAC target - smart planning for optimization and learning phases.

**Step 5 Complete: $525K acquisition budget with $45 efficiency buffer**

Now for value proposition. You mentioned operational efficiency and real-time visibility, but we need messaging that cuts through to busy logistics managers drowning in spreadsheets.

What's your strongest proof point that makes prospects believe SwiftDeliver actually solves their scaling bottleneck? Customer success story, specific time savings, cost reduction data?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 8:
Powerful value prop - 62% admin time reduction and $120K annual savings with real headcount impact. That's exactly the proof point that justifies budget to CFOs and solves the growth bottleneck pain.

Your messaging framework: "Scale logistics without scaling headcount" backed by the Atlanta case study. For SMBs scaling from $5M to $25M, proving they can grow revenue without proportional ops overhead is compelling ROI.

**Step 6 Complete: Scalability value proposition with quantified proof points**

Channel strategy time. With $525K acquisition budget targeting $150 CAC, you mentioned LinkedIn and Google Search as high-intent channels. 

Based on your B2B audience and efficiency targets, I'm seeing LinkedIn (job title targeting), Google Search (solution-intent keywords), and potentially Google Display (retargeting) as your core mix.

What's your current experience with these channels, and do you have any performance baselines to build from?
