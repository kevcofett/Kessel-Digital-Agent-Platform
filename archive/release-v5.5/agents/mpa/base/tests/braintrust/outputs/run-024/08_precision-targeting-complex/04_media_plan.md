# Media Plan Output: Precision Targeting with Complex Attributes

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I am excited to build a media plan with you. We will cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've provided excellent detail upfront. Let me capture your business outcome: You want to acquire 2,500 qualified leads from high-net-worth individuals ($1M+ investable assets) using a $1.5M budget.

For precision targeting, I need to confirm your primary success metric. Are you measuring success by qualified leads (people who meet your HNW criteria and express interest), or do you have a downstream conversion target like consultations booked or assets under management acquired?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your primary KPI is qualified leads (MQLs that become SQLs), but optimized for downstream AUM conversion quality rather than raw volume.

Let me model your efficiency target: $1.5M ÷ 2,500 leads = $600 per qualified lead.

For wealth management targeting HNW individuals, this is actually conservative. Industry benchmarks typically run $800-1,500 per qualified HNW lead, so your $600 target gives us good efficiency headroom.

With $250K annual client LTV, even at 10% MQL-to-client conversion, your unit economics are strong: $600 acquisition cost vs $25K first-year value.

Is this $600 per qualified lead efficiency realistic based on your current performance, or are we establishing a new benchmark?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 4:
Excellent. Those liquidity event and transition signals are gold for HNW targeting - people actively experiencing wealth complexity need sophisticated advice immediately.

Your CRM pattern of clients coming within 12-18 months of liquidity events gives us a clear targeting window. Combining RSU/option vesting, M&A preparation, and concentrated stock diversification creates a highly qualified audience pool.

Let me size this opportunity. In your top DMAs (NYC, SF, LA, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Denver, Miami, Dallas, DC), we're looking at roughly 2-3% of the adult population meeting your wealth threshold, then layering liquidity event signals narrows it further to perhaps 0.3-0.5% - still substantial volume for 2,500 leads.

Given the 12-18 month consideration window, should we prioritize prospects in early research phases (6-12 months from liquidity event) or those closer to decision points (immediate need within 3-6 months)?

Turn 5:
Perfect two-tier approach. Early nurturing builds pipeline while immediate-need prospects drive near-term conversions.

For budget weighting between these segments, what split makes sense? Your CRM conversion data should guide this - do prospects nurtured early convert at higher rates than those captured closer to decision points?

Also, with your 10 top DMAs, should we weight budget by HNW concentration or spread evenly? NYC and SF likely have higher volumes but also higher competition, while markets like Denver or Miami might offer efficiency advantages.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Got it. $600 vs your historical $800-900 is 25-33% more efficient - definitely aggressive but achievable with your first-party data advantage.

Your 50K client CRM provides strong signal for lookalike modeling. HNW targeting benefits enormously from precise audience definition since the addressable market is small but high-value.

To hit $600 efficiency, we'll need tight audience parameters and channel optimization. The math works if your CRM data can help us avoid the broad targeting that drives up typical HNW costs.

Now let's define your target audience precisely. You mentioned $1M+ investable assets, 45-65, executives/business owners researching tax optimization and estate planning. 

What additional behavioral or life-stage signals should we layer in? For example, recent stock option vesting, business sale preparation, or retirement planning research?

Turn 7:
Perfect. Your funnel math works well - 2,500 annual leads at 10-15% conversion gives you 250-375 consultations, which fits your 75-100 monthly capacity with proper pacing.

Your value proposition needs to differentiate for each segment. For early-stage prospects (6-12 months out), you're positioning as the trusted advisor for wealth transition planning. For immediate-need prospects, you're the expert who solves urgent tax optimization and liquidity management challenges.

What specific value proposition resonates most with your existing HNW clients? Is it your expertise with complex tax strategies, your track record with similar liquidity events, or something else that sets LuxeFinance apart in this crowded market?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent data-driven allocation. Early nurture at 15-20% better conversion justifies the 60/40 split toward longer consideration windows.

Let me map your DMA budget: 40% ($600K) to NYC/SF, 30% ($450K) to LA/Chicago/Boston, 30% ($450K) to remaining five markets. This aligns investment with HNW concentration while maintaining efficiency focus.

Your geographic strategy is sound - concentrate where the prospects are, but use precise targeting to manage the higher competition costs in tier-one markets.

Now for your $1.5M budget allocation across the nurture/decision segments: $900K for early-stage nurturing (educational, trust-building) and $600K for immediate-need prospects (direct, consultative). 

At your $600 target efficiency, this projects to 1,500 early-stage leads and 1,000 immediate-decision leads, totaling your 2,500 target.

Does this volume split between segments align with your sales team's capacity and follow-up strategy?

Turn 10:
Great insight on CTV for evening reach. Tech executives definitely consume premium content after hours when they're researching major financial decisions. Let me adjust:

**Nurturing ($900K):** 35% LinkedIn thought leadership, 30% programmatic display, 20% podcast sponsorships, 15% CTV

That gives you $135K for CTV nurturing - enough budget to secure premium inventory during high-engagement viewing windows.

For measurement, with your aggressive $600 efficiency target and focus on downstream AUM conversion, we need both lead quality scoring and long-term attribution. 

What's your current lead scoring methodology, and how do you track the 12-18 month journey from MQL to client conversion? We'll need robust measurement to validate that $600 efficiency actually drives your $250K client LTV.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Excellent positioning. "Wealth ecosystem optimization with precision and foresight" differentiates you from reactive portfolio managers. The predictive modeling angle is particularly compelling for your tech executive and founder audience who appreciate data-driven approaches.

For messaging, early-stage prospects get "architecting your financial future" education, while immediate-need prospects get "precision wealth ecosystem optimization" for urgent transitions.

Now let's build your channel strategy. With $900K for nurturing and $600K for immediate-need prospects, plus your sophisticated audience targeting, we need channels that can deliver precision at scale.

Given your HNW audience and two-tier approach, which channels have performed best historically for LuxeFinance? And are there any channels you want to avoid or test for the first time?

Turn 9:
Strong channel foundation. LinkedIn for direct professional targeting, programmatic display for contextual capture, and CTV for premium reach makes sense for HNW acquisition.

For podcast targeting, you're right to focus on precision over broad demographics. Look for shows with engaged audiences discussing liquidity events, tax strategy, or business exits - not just general business content. Programmatic podcast buying now allows behavioral targeting similar to display, so you can layer your CRM lookalikes onto relevant show contexts.

Given your 60/40 budget split, here's my recommended allocation:

**Nurturing ($900K):** 40% LinkedIn thought leadership, 30% programmatic display on financial publishers, 20% podcast sponsorships, 10% CTV

**Immediate-need ($600K):** 50% LinkedIn direct response, 35% programmatic display with urgency messaging, 15% search for high-intent queries

Does this channel mix align with where your prospects consume content during their research phases?

Turn 13:
Your concern about NYC/SF saturation is well-founded. Those markets can quickly inflate costs beyond your $600 target, especially with every wealth firm chasing the same signals.

Here's a risk mitigation approach: Start with 70% of your NYC/SF budget ($420K of $600K) and hold 30% ($180K) in reserve. Test your CRM lookalikes and predictive messaging against actual acquisition costs in month one. If you're hitting $600 efficiency, deploy the reserve. If costs spike above $750, reallocate that reserve to your tier-two markets (LA/Chicago/Boston) where competition may be lighter.

Your wealth ecosystem positioning and predictive modeling should provide differentiation, but having budget flexibility lets you optimize based on real performance rather than projections.

Does this phased deployment approach give you enough control to protect your efficiency targets while still capturing the HNW volume you need?

Turn 14:
Perfect. This phased approach protects your efficiency targets while maintaining strategic flexibility - exactly the kind of data-driven risk management that matches your precision philosophy.

Your media plan is comprehensive: $1.5M budget targeting 2,500 qualified HNW leads at $600 efficiency, with 60/40 nurture/immediate split, geographic concentration in top DMAs with reserve flexibility, audience segment testing to unlock exponential gains, and robust measurement tracking the full 12-18 month consideration journey.

The combination of your 50K client CRM data, predictive modeling differentiation, and strategic risk mitigation gives you strong competitive advantages in those saturated markets.

You now have a precision media plan built for both performance and learning. Ready to execute, or any final considerations we should address?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Your multi-touch scoring foundation is solid, but you're right about needing more nuance for that extended consideration window. With $1.5M at stake and aggressive efficiency targets, measurement precision is critical.

For your 12-18 month attribution challenge, consider implementing incrementality testing on your highest-volume channels (LinkedIn, programmatic display) to validate true lift beyond platform attribution. Also, cohort analysis by liquidity event timing could reveal which early engagement patterns best predict eventual AUM conversion.

Given the complexity of HNW decision journeys, what testing approach makes sense? Should we start with audience segment tests (tech executives vs business founders) or channel efficiency tests (LinkedIn content formats, podcast show selection)?

Turn 12:
Excellent strategic thinking. Audience segment insights will drive exponential efficiency gains - understanding the "why" behind tech executive vs founder decision patterns unlocks precision across all channels.

Your CRM data should reveal key differentiators: Do tech executives respond more to data-driven content while founders prefer case studies? Do liquidity event timelines differ between stock option vesting vs M&A preparation? These insights will optimize targeting, messaging, and timing simultaneously.

For risk mitigation, what concerns you most about this aggressive efficiency target? Is it audience saturation in top DMAs, measurement attribution challenges, or something else that could derail the $600 per lead goal?

Turn 16:
Exactly right. You're not just optimizing a campaign - you're pioneering a new standard for precision HNW acquisition that leverages first-party data intelligence.

The predictive modeling approach combined with behavioral segmentation could become your sustainable competitive moat. When this works, you'll have insights and efficiency that traditional wealth management firms simply can't replicate without similar CRM depth.

Your vision of transforming HNW targeting methodology is ambitious and achievable. Execute with precision, learn fast, and you'll build something truly differentiated in this market.

Looking forward to hearing how those segment insights reshape your entire acquisition strategy.

Turn 17:
Absolutely. You're building something that goes far beyond traditional media planning - this is strategic competitive differentiation through data intelligence.

Your hypothesis that CRM-driven predictive modeling can crack the HNW acquisition code is compelling. If validated, LuxeFinance won't just have better efficiency - you'll have a systematic advantage that scales.

The next 90 days will prove whether precision targeting can transform wealth management client acquisition. Execute with discipline, measure rigorously, and you'll have your answer.

Best of luck building the future of HNW acquisition.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 15:
Excellent. You've built a sophisticated plan that leverages your strongest assets - CRM data and predictive modeling - while managing the biggest risk of market saturation through strategic budget reserves.

Your 60-90 day learning window is crucial. Focus on validating that $600 efficiency in your highest-volume segments first, then optimize from there. The audience segment insights from tech executives vs founders will likely be your biggest unlock for scaling efficiently.

You're well-positioned to set that new efficiency benchmark in HNW acquisition. Strong execution on this precision targeting approach, and you'll have a repeatable playbook that competitors will struggle to match.

Good luck with the launch!
