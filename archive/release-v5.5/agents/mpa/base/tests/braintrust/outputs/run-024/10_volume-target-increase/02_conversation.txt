USER:
Hi, I'm the Marketing Manager at HomeStyle Direct. We're an e-commerce company selling home goods. I need to build a media plan for Q1-Q2. We have a $400K budget and need to acquire 5,000 new customers. Our average customer LTV is $320. Can you help me put together a plan?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've given me great starting data. Let me check the math: $400K ÷ 5,000 customers = $80 per customer acquisition cost. With $320 LTV, that's a 4:1 ratio - solid for home goods where typical CAC runs $60-100.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 5,000 new customers?

TURN 2 (Step 3)

USER:
We want to grow our online sales and establish HomeStyle Direct as a go-to destination for modern, affordable home décor. These 5,000 customers will help us expand our market share and increase our digital presence in the home goods e-commerce space. Ideally, we'd like to see these customers generate around $1.6 million in total revenue.

AGENT:
Perfect! You're targeting $1.6M in revenue from 5,000 customers, which equals $320 average order value - that aligns with your LTV data. Your objective is market share growth and brand establishment in modern home décor.

Now I need to understand how you'll measure success. You've mentioned revenue and customer count, but what will be your primary KPI - the main number you'll track to know if the campaign is working?

TURN 3 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I'm thinking ROAS will be our key metric. We want to see at least a 4:1 return on our ad spend, so we'll track how much revenue we generate for every dollar we put into media. Getting those 5,000 customers while maintaining a strong return is our primary goal.

AGENT:
I need to flag a concern about ROAS as your primary KPI. ROAS is commonly requested but can be misleading due to platform inflation and attribution issues. Platforms often claim credit for sales that would have happened anyway, inflating reported ROAS by 20-40%.

Given your clear volume target of 5,000 customers and $80 CAC target, I'd recommend tracking **new customer acquisitions** as your primary KPI, with **cost per acquisition** as the efficiency metric. This gives you cleaner measurement tied directly to your business outcome.

Your 4:1 ROAS target ($1.6M revenue ÷ $400K spend) is achievable, but would you be open to using customer acquisition as the primary success measure instead?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 4 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
That makes sense. I'm definitely open to focusing on new customer acquisition as our primary KPI. We know we want those 5,000 customers, and tracking cost per acquisition feels more direct than ROAS. My team has sometimes struggled with platform attribution claims, so a clearer metric would help us understand our true performance. Let's go with new customer count and CAC as our main indicators.

AGENT:
Excellent choice! New customer acquisition gives you much cleaner measurement. So we have:

**Step 1 Complete:**
- Objective: Market share growth in modern home décor
- Primary KPI: New customer acquisitions 
- Target: 5,000 customers at $80 CAC = $400K budget

Now for economics validation. At $80 CAC with $320 LTV, you're targeting a 4:1 ratio. For home goods e-commerce, this is realistic - typical CAC runs $60-100, so you're in the sweet spot.

What's your gross margin on that $320 average order? This will help us confirm your $80 CAC is sustainable for profitability.

TURN 5 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're running around 42% gross margin on our average order. So for that $320 order, we're looking at about $134 in gross profit. That gives us some cushion to work with for customer acquisition and other costs. I think our margins make the $80 CAC look pretty reasonable, but I'm curious to hear what you think about that.

AGENT:
Let me run those numbers. $320 × 42% = $134 gross profit per customer. With $80 CAC, you have $54 remaining gross profit ($134 - $80). That's a healthy 40% profit margin after acquisition costs - very solid for home goods.

Your economics are realistic and sustainable. The $80 CAC represents 60% of gross profit, leaving meaningful contribution for operations and growth. This efficiency target is achievable in the home goods market.

**Step 2 Complete:** Economics validated at $80 CAC with strong unit economics.

Now let's define your audience. Who is your ideal customer for modern, affordable home décor? Think demographics, lifestyle, and shopping behaviors.

TURN 6 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're targeting homeowners aged 30-55 who are interested in updating their home décor without breaking the bank. They're typically professionals or young families who want stylish, contemporary pieces that are affordable. They're active online, love browsing Pinterest and Instagram for design inspiration, and are comfortable making home purchases through e-commerce platforms. They value design, but also want practical, good-value pieces that fit their lifestyle.

AGENT:
Great foundation! You've identified the core: 30-55 homeowners, value-conscious, digitally native, inspired by social platforms. 

To sharpen our targeting, I need to understand their purchase behavior better. When these customers buy home décor, are they typically:
- Decorating a new home/apartment
- Refreshing existing spaces seasonally  
- Making specific room updates (like bedroom or living room)
- Or a mix of these scenarios?

This will help us identify the right moments and motivations to reach them.

TURN 7 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
It's a mix, but we see the most engagement when people are refreshing specific spaces or doing targeted room updates. Living rooms and bedrooms are our strongest categories. These customers aren't usually doing whole-home makeovers, but they're strategic about updating key areas to keep their spaces feeling modern and fresh. They'll invest in a few statement pieces rather than completely overhauling everything at once.

AGENT:
Perfect! Room-specific refreshers buying statement pieces - that's a strong targeting signal. These customers are in active refresh mode rather than emergency replacement, which means they're more engaged and quality-focused.

With 30-55 homeowners doing strategic room updates, primarily living rooms and bedrooms, and active on Pinterest/Instagram for inspiration - we have solid audience definition.

Now for geography. Are you targeting nationally, or do you have specific regions or markets that perform better for HomeStyle Direct?

TURN 8 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I just got out of a meeting with leadership. They're pushing for 8,000 customers instead of 5,000. The board wants more aggressive growth. Is that realistic with our current budget? What would we need to change?

AGENT:
Let me update our projections. $400K ÷ 8,000 = $50 per customer. That's 37.5% more efficient than our validated $80 baseline.

At $50 CAC vs the $60-100 typical for home goods, you're targeting 17-50% below market benchmarks. This is aggressive and will require:

- Tighter audience targeting (room-specific refreshers help here)
- Higher-efficiency channels 
- Or additional budget: 8,000 × $80 = $640K

Your unit economics still work ($134 gross profit - $50 CAC = $84 remaining), but hitting $50 CAC demands precision execution.

Would leadership consider increasing budget to $640K, or do you want to build the plan around the aggressive $50 efficiency target?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 9 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're going to try the aggressive target. I know it'll be challenging, but our leadership wants growth, and they're not likely to increase the budget. We'll need to be laser-focused on our most efficient channels - I'm thinking heavily leveraging Pinterest and Google Shopping, where our design-conscious audience is already searching. We'll have to get really precise with our targeting and messaging to hit that $50 CAC.

AGENT:
Got it - $50 CAC target with the $400K budget. Your instinct on Pinterest and Google Shopping is smart for design-conscious customers already in shopping mode.

To hit this aggressive efficiency, we'll need surgical precision on audience targeting. You mentioned room-specific refreshers focusing on living rooms and bedrooms - that's our foundation.

Before we get to channels in Step 7, let's finish defining geography. Are you targeting nationally, or do certain regions perform better for HomeStyle Direct? Geographic focus could help us achieve that $50 efficiency.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 10 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're nationwide right now, but our data shows stronger performance in urban and suburban areas in the Northeast and West Coast - particularly around major metro areas like Seattle, San Francisco, Boston, and New York. Those markets have higher concentrations of our target demographic: professionals in their 30s and 40s with design-conscious mindsets. So while we want national reach, we'll likely concentrate media spend in those higher-performing regions to maximize efficiency.

AGENT:
Perfect! Geographic concentration in high-performing metros is exactly what you need for $50 CAC efficiency. Seattle, SF, Boston, and NYC metros have your core demographic density and proven conversion rates.

**Step 4 Complete:** Target audience is 30-55 homeowners in major Northeast/West Coast metros doing strategic room refreshes, primarily living rooms and bedrooms.

Now for budget allocation. With $400K total and geographic concentration strategy, how are you thinking about splitting investment? Should we weight heavily toward your proven high-performing metros, or maintain some national presence for growth exploration?
