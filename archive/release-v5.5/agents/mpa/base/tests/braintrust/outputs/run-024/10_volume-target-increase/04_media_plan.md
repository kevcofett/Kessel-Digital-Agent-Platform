# Media Plan Output: Volume Target Increase

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've given me great starting data. Let me check the math: $400K ÷ 5,000 customers = $80 per customer acquisition cost. With $320 LTV, that's a 4:1 ratio - solid for home goods where typical CAC runs $60-100.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 5,000 new customers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect! You're targeting $1.6M in revenue from 5,000 customers, which equals $320 average order value - that aligns with your LTV data. Your objective is market share growth and brand establishment in modern home décor.

Now I need to understand how you'll measure success. You've mentioned revenue and customer count, but what will be your primary KPI - the main number you'll track to know if the campaign is working?

Turn 4:
Excellent choice! New customer acquisition gives you much cleaner measurement. So we have:

**Step 1 Complete:**
- Objective: Market share growth in modern home décor
- Primary KPI: New customer acquisitions 
- Target: 5,000 customers at $80 CAC = $400K budget

Now for economics validation. At $80 CAC with $320 LTV, you're targeting a 4:1 ratio. For home goods e-commerce, this is realistic - typical CAC runs $60-100, so you're in the sweet spot.

What's your gross margin on that $320 average order? This will help us confirm your $80 CAC is sustainable for profitability.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
I need to flag a concern about ROAS as your primary KPI. ROAS is commonly requested but can be misleading due to platform inflation and attribution issues. Platforms often claim credit for sales that would have happened anyway, inflating reported ROAS by 20-40%.

Given your clear volume target of 5,000 customers and $80 CAC target, I'd recommend tracking **new customer acquisitions** as your primary KPI, with **cost per acquisition** as the efficiency metric. This gives you cleaner measurement tied directly to your business outcome.

Your 4:1 ROAS target ($1.6M revenue ÷ $400K spend) is achievable, but would you be open to using customer acquisition as the primary success measure instead?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Let me run those numbers. $320 × 42% = $134 gross profit per customer. With $80 CAC, you have $54 remaining gross profit ($134 - $80). That's a healthy 40% profit margin after acquisition costs - very solid for home goods.

Your economics are realistic and sustainable. The $80 CAC represents 60% of gross profit, leaving meaningful contribution for operations and growth. This efficiency target is achievable in the home goods market.

**Step 2 Complete:** Economics validated at $80 CAC with strong unit economics.

Now let's define your audience. Who is your ideal customer for modern, affordable home décor? Think demographics, lifestyle, and shopping behaviors.

Turn 6:
Great foundation! You've identified the core: 30-55 homeowners, value-conscious, digitally native, inspired by social platforms. 

To sharpen our targeting, I need to understand their purchase behavior better. When these customers buy home décor, are they typically:
- Decorating a new home/apartment
- Refreshing existing spaces seasonally  
- Making specific room updates (like bedroom or living room)
- Or a mix of these scenarios?

This will help us identify the right moments and motivations to reach them.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 7:
Perfect! Room-specific refreshers buying statement pieces - that's a strong targeting signal. These customers are in active refresh mode rather than emergency replacement, which means they're more engaged and quality-focused.

With 30-55 homeowners doing strategic room updates, primarily living rooms and bedrooms, and active on Pinterest/Instagram for inspiration - we have solid audience definition.

Now for geography. Are you targeting nationally, or do you have specific regions or markets that perform better for HomeStyle Direct?

Turn 8:
Let me update our projections. $400K ÷ 8,000 = $50 per customer. That's 37.5% more efficient than our validated $80 baseline.

At $50 CAC vs the $60-100 typical for home goods, you're targeting 17-50% below market benchmarks. This is aggressive and will require:

- Tighter audience targeting (room-specific refreshers help here)
- Higher-efficiency channels 
- Or additional budget: 8,000 × $80 = $640K

Your unit economics still work ($134 gross profit - $50 CAC = $84 remaining), but hitting $50 CAC demands precision execution.

Would leadership consider increasing budget to $640K, or do you want to build the plan around the aggressive $50 efficiency target?

Turn 9:
Got it - $50 CAC target with the $400K budget. Your instinct on Pinterest and Google Shopping is smart for design-conscious customers already in shopping mode.

To hit this aggressive efficiency, we'll need surgical precision on audience targeting. You mentioned room-specific refreshers focusing on living rooms and bedrooms - that's our foundation.

Before we get to channels in Step 7, let's finish defining geography. Are you targeting nationally, or do certain regions perform better for HomeStyle Direct? Geographic focus could help us achieve that $50 efficiency.

Turn 10:
Perfect! Geographic concentration in high-performing metros is exactly what you need for $50 CAC efficiency. Seattle, SF, Boston, and NYC metros have your core demographic density and proven conversion rates.

**Step 4 Complete:** Target audience is 30-55 homeowners in major Northeast/West Coast metros doing strategic room refreshes, primarily living rooms and bedrooms.

Now for budget allocation. With $400K total and geographic concentration strategy, how are you thinking about splitting investment? Should we weight heavily toward your proven high-performing metros, or maintain some national presence for growth exploration?
