TURN 1 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Hi, I'm VP of Demand Gen at DataScale Systems. We sell enterprise data infrastructure with an average deal size of $150K. I need to build a media plan for next year. We have $1M budget and need to generate 500 qualified opportunities. Our ICP is enterprise companies with 5000+ employees, targeting data and IT leaders.

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your business outcome. You mentioned 500 qualified opportunities - is your primary objective lead generation, or are you ultimately targeting a specific number of closed deals from those opportunities?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 2 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our primary objective is closed deals. Those 500 qualified opportunities should convert to around 50-75 closed deals, which would hit our revenue targets. We're focused on quality over quantity, so every opportunity needs to be highly vetted.

AGENT:
Perfect. So your primary objective is closed deals with 50-75 as your target range. 

At $150K average deal size, that's $7.5M to $11.25M in pipeline value from quality opportunities. Your $1M budget targeting 50-75 deals means $13K-20K cost per closed deal.

For enterprise data infrastructure, that efficiency is realistic - complex B2B sales typically run $15K-25K per deal at this size.

What's your primary KPI for measuring success? Are you tracking cost per closed deal, or do you have a specific revenue target from these 50-75 deals?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 3 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our primary KPI is definitely ACV - we want to hit $7.5M to $11.25M in net new annual contract value. Cost per closed deal is important, but revenue growth is the ultimate metric for our board and leadership team. We're aiming to keep our customer acquisition costs under 20% of that total contract value.

AGENT:
Excellent. So $7.5M-11.25M in ACV is your target, with customer acquisition cost under 20% of contract value.

Let me check the math: 20% of $150K average deal = $30K maximum CAC per deal. Your $1M budget targeting 50-75 deals = $13K-20K per deal, which is well within your 20% threshold. That's conservative and gives you room for optimization.

To complete Step 1, what's driving the 50-75 range? Is 50 your minimum viable target, or are you comfortable modeling at a specific number like 60 deals for planning purposes?

Events: calculation_performed, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 4 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're targeting 60 deals as our baseline plan. Anything above that is upside, but 60 deals represents a solid, achievable target that our leadership team and sales organization can confidently support. It gives us a bit of buffer from the lower end of our range while still being aggressive enough to drive meaningful growth.

AGENT:
Perfect. 60 deals at $150K each = $9M ACV target with $1M budget = $16.7K cost per deal. That's well within your 20% CAC threshold and represents solid efficiency for enterprise sales.

Now for Step 2 - Economics. At $16.7K per deal, you're targeting about 11% of contract value for acquisition cost. For enterprise data infrastructure deals with long sales cycles, this is quite achievable.

What's your typical deal profitability or gross margin? This helps validate whether the $16.7K acquisition cost leaves sufficient margin for business growth.

Events: calculation_performed, benchmark_cited

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 5 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our gross margins are typically around 70-75% for our data infrastructure solutions. So at $150K ACV, we're looking at $105K-$112K in gross margin per deal. The $16.7K acquisition cost still leaves us plenty of room for profitability and reinvestment. We're comfortable with this economic model as long as we can maintain those margin levels and hit our deal volume targets.

AGENT:
Excellent economics. At 70-75% gross margin, your $16.7K acquisition cost represents just 15-16% of gross margin per deal - very healthy for enterprise software.

$105K-112K gross margin minus $16.7K acquisition cost leaves $88K-95K contribution per deal. That's strong unit economics that support sustainable growth.

Your efficiency target is realistic for enterprise data infrastructure. Similar companies typically see $15K-25K per deal, so you're well-positioned.

Step 2 complete. Ready to move to Step 3 - Audience definition. You mentioned targeting data and IT leaders at 5000+ employee companies. Let's get more specific about who makes or influences these $150K infrastructure decisions.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 6 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Great point. We're typically targeting VP and Director-level leaders in data engineering, cloud architecture, and enterprise IT infrastructure. These are technical decision makers who understand the complexity of data scaling challenges. Our buying committee usually involves 5-7 stakeholders, with final sign-off from VP of Infrastructure or CTO. They care about performance, scalability, and total cost of ownership more than flashy features.

AGENT:
Perfect. So VP/Director level in data engineering, cloud architecture, and enterprise IT infrastructure - technical buyers who evaluate on performance, scalability, and TCO.

Beyond titles and seniority, what behavioral or firmographic signals indicate a company needs your data infrastructure solutions? For example, are they experiencing specific growth stages, using certain technologies, or showing signs of data scaling challenges?

TURN 7 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I just got out of a budget review meeting and I have bad news. We're facing company-wide cost cuts and my budget has been reduced from $1M to $600K. That's a 40% cut. What do we need to change? I still need to hit my pipeline targets.

AGENT:
$600K budget targeting 60 deals = $10K per deal. That's 40% more efficient than your original $16.7K target.

For enterprise data infrastructure, $10K per deal is aggressive - market typically runs $15K-25K. You'd need exceptional targeting precision and channel efficiency to hit this.

Three options to consider:
1. Reduce target to ~36 deals ($16.7K each) - maintains realistic efficiency
2. Keep 60 deals but accept higher risk execution 
3. Hybrid: target 45-50 deals with tight audience focus

The $10K efficiency is possible but requires perfect execution. Which direction makes most sense given your revenue commitments?

Events: calculation_performed, benchmark_cited, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 8 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Option 3 feels like the most pragmatic approach. We'll target 45-50 deals, which gives us a realistic buffer while still maintaining aggressive growth targets. To hit this, we'll need laser-focused targeting on our most likely enterprise prospects - probably companies showing clear signals of data infrastructure scaling challenges. Our channel strategy will need to be extremely precise, likely leaning heavily into intent-based marketing and ultra-targeted ABM approaches.

AGENT:
Smart choice. 45-50 deals at $600K = $12K-13.3K per deal. That's much more achievable than $10K while still requiring disciplined execution.

You're right about needing precision - at this efficiency, every dollar needs to work harder. Intent-based and ABM approaches make sense for enterprise infrastructure sales.

Before we dive into those channel specifics in Step 7, let's finish defining your audience signals. You mentioned companies showing data infrastructure scaling challenges - what specific indicators do you look for? Things like recent funding, tech stack changes, job postings, or technology adoption patterns?

Events: calculation_performed, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 9 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're looking for a few key signals: rapid cloud migration patterns, significant increases in data engineering job postings, companies that have recently closed large funding rounds in Series B or C, and those using legacy data infrastructure like Hadoop that are likely outgrowing their current systems. We've found companies scaling from 2000 to 5000+ employees are particularly ripe for our solution, especially if they're in high-growth tech, financial services, or healthcare sectors where data complexity is exploding.

AGENT:
Excellent signals. Rapid cloud migration, data engineering hiring spikes, Series B/C funding, legacy Hadoop usage, and 2000-5000+ employee scaling phase - those are strong intent indicators.

High-growth tech, financial services, and healthcare with exploding data complexity narrows your focus to sectors that truly need enterprise infrastructure.

One more audience question: Within those target companies, beyond the VP/Director technical buyers, who else typically influences or champions these infrastructure decisions? Understanding the full buying committee helps optimize messaging and channel selection.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 10 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our buying committee is complex. Beyond technical leaders, we see significant influence from CFOs who care about cost optimization, CIOs evaluating overall infrastructure strategy, and increasingly, Chief Data Officers who are becoming key champions for modernization. The financial stakeholders are particularly critical - they're looking at total cost of ownership and long-term scalability, not just technical specifications. In most deals, the CTO or CIO provides final sign-off, but the economic buyer is usually the CFO who wants to see clear ROI and efficiency gains.

AGENT:
Perfect. So technical champions (VP/Director level) drive evaluation, but financial stakeholders (CFO, CIO, CDO) control approval based on ROI and TCO.

That multi-stakeholder dynamic is crucial for your $12K-13.3K efficiency target - you need messaging that resonates with both technical performance concerns and financial value propositions.

Step 3 complete. For Step 4 - Geography, are you targeting specific regions or markets? With enterprise accounts, geographic concentration often affects both targeting efficiency and sales coverage.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 11 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're primarily focused on the US, with secondary markets in the UK and Germany. These regions have the most mature enterprise tech ecosystems and companies experiencing the data scaling challenges we solve. The US will get about 70% of our budget and targeting effort, with UK and Germany splitting the remaining 30%. Our sales team is strongest in these markets, and they align well with our ICP's concentration of high-growth tech and financial services companies.

AGENT:
Good geographic focus. US at 70% = $420K, UK and Germany splitting 30% = $90K each. That concentration makes sense given your sales coverage and market maturity.

At those allocations: US targeting ~32 deals at $13.1K each, UK/Germany each targeting ~7 deals at $12.9K each. The efficiency is consistent across regions, which is realistic for enterprise infrastructure sales.

Step 4 complete. For Step 5 - Budget allocation, beyond the 70/30 geographic split, do you want to allocate budget by audience segment or buying committee role? For example, different spend levels for technical champions versus financial decision makers?
