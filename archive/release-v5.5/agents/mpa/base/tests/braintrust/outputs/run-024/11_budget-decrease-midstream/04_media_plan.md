# Media Plan Output: Budget Decrease Midstream

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your business outcome. You mentioned 500 qualified opportunities - is your primary objective lead generation, or are you ultimately targeting a specific number of closed deals from those opportunities?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your primary objective is closed deals with 50-75 as your target range. 

At $150K average deal size, that's $7.5M to $11.25M in pipeline value from quality opportunities. Your $1M budget targeting 50-75 deals means $13K-20K cost per closed deal.

For enterprise data infrastructure, that efficiency is realistic - complex B2B sales typically run $15K-25K per deal at this size.

What's your primary KPI for measuring success? Are you tracking cost per closed deal, or do you have a specific revenue target from these 50-75 deals?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent. So $7.5M-11.25M in ACV is your target, with customer acquisition cost under 20% of contract value.

Let me check the math: 20% of $150K average deal = $30K maximum CAC per deal. Your $1M budget targeting 50-75 deals = $13K-20K per deal, which is well within your 20% threshold. That's conservative and gives you room for optimization.

To complete Step 1, what's driving the 50-75 range? Is 50 your minimum viable target, or are you comfortable modeling at a specific number like 60 deals for planning purposes?

Turn 4:
Perfect. 60 deals at $150K each = $9M ACV target with $1M budget = $16.7K cost per deal. That's well within your 20% CAC threshold and represents solid efficiency for enterprise sales.

Now for Step 2 - Economics. At $16.7K per deal, you're targeting about 11% of contract value for acquisition cost. For enterprise data infrastructure deals with long sales cycles, this is quite achievable.

What's your typical deal profitability or gross margin? This helps validate whether the $16.7K acquisition cost leaves sufficient margin for business growth.

Turn 5:
Excellent economics. At 70-75% gross margin, your $16.7K acquisition cost represents just 15-16% of gross margin per deal - very healthy for enterprise software.

$105K-112K gross margin minus $16.7K acquisition cost leaves $88K-95K contribution per deal. That's strong unit economics that support sustainable growth.

Your efficiency target is realistic for enterprise data infrastructure. Similar companies typically see $15K-25K per deal, so you're well-positioned.

Step 2 complete. Ready to move to Step 3 - Audience definition. You mentioned targeting data and IT leaders at 5000+ employee companies. Let's get more specific about who makes or influences these $150K infrastructure decisions.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Perfect. So VP/Director level in data engineering, cloud architecture, and enterprise IT infrastructure - technical buyers who evaluate on performance, scalability, and TCO.

Beyond titles and seniority, what behavioral or firmographic signals indicate a company needs your data infrastructure solutions? For example, are they experiencing specific growth stages, using certain technologies, or showing signs of data scaling challenges?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
$600K budget targeting 60 deals = $10K per deal. That's 40% more efficient than your original $16.7K target.

For enterprise data infrastructure, $10K per deal is aggressive - market typically runs $15K-25K. You'd need exceptional targeting precision and channel efficiency to hit this.

Three options to consider:
1. Reduce target to ~36 deals ($16.7K each) - maintains realistic efficiency
2. Keep 60 deals but accept higher risk execution 
3. Hybrid: target 45-50 deals with tight audience focus

The $10K efficiency is possible but requires perfect execution. Which direction makes most sense given your revenue commitments?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
Smart choice. 45-50 deals at $600K = $12K-13.3K per deal. That's much more achievable than $10K while still requiring disciplined execution.

You're right about needing precision - at this efficiency, every dollar needs to work harder. Intent-based and ABM approaches make sense for enterprise infrastructure sales.

Before we dive into those channel specifics in Step 7, let's finish defining your audience signals. You mentioned companies showing data infrastructure scaling challenges - what specific indicators do you look for? Things like recent funding, tech stack changes, job postings, or technology adoption patterns?

Turn 9:
Excellent signals. Rapid cloud migration, data engineering hiring spikes, Series B/C funding, legacy Hadoop usage, and 2000-5000+ employee scaling phase - those are strong intent indicators.

High-growth tech, financial services, and healthcare with exploding data complexity narrows your focus to sectors that truly need enterprise infrastructure.

One more audience question: Within those target companies, beyond the VP/Director technical buyers, who else typically influences or champions these infrastructure decisions? Understanding the full buying committee helps optimize messaging and channel selection.

Turn 10:
Perfect. So technical champions (VP/Director level) drive evaluation, but financial stakeholders (CFO, CIO, CDO) control approval based on ROI and TCO.

That multi-stakeholder dynamic is crucial for your $12K-13.3K efficiency target - you need messaging that resonates with both technical performance concerns and financial value propositions.

Step 3 complete. For Step 4 - Geography, are you targeting specific regions or markets? With enterprise accounts, geographic concentration often affects both targeting efficiency and sales coverage.

Turn 11:
Good geographic focus. US at 70% = $420K, UK and Germany splitting 30% = $90K each. That concentration makes sense given your sales coverage and market maturity.

At those allocations: US targeting ~32 deals at $13.1K each, UK/Germany each targeting ~7 deals at $12.9K each. The efficiency is consistent across regions, which is realistic for enterprise infrastructure sales.

Step 4 complete. For Step 5 - Budget allocation, beyond the 70/30 geographic split, do you want to allocate budget by audience segment or buying committee role? For example, different spend levels for technical champions versus financial decision makers?
