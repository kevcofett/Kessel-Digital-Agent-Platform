# Media Plan Output: Budget Revision Midstream

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your efficiency target. $500K / 10,000 customers = $50 CAC. With $2,400 LTV, that's a strong 48:1 LTV:CAC ratio. For B2B SaaS, $50 CAC is quite aggressive - typical runs $150-400 depending on deal size.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 10,000 new customers?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your objective is ARR growth and market positioning through scalable acquisition. With 10,000 customers at $2,400 LTV, that's $24M in new ARR - significant growth.

Your primary KPI should align with this objective. Given your focus on scalable acquisition and the aggressive $50 CAC target, what's most important to track: total new customers acquired, cost per acquisition staying under $50, or ARR added per marketing dollar?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent. So your primary KPI is total new customers acquired, with $50 CAC as a critical efficiency constraint.

Let me validate the economics. At $50 CAC vs typical B2B SaaS $150-400, you're targeting 67-88% below benchmark. This is highly aggressive and will require exceptional targeting precision and channel efficiency.

For context, what's your average deal size or monthly subscription value? This helps assess if $50 CAC is achievable given your customer economics.

Turn 4:
Got it. $200/month × 12 = $2,400 annual value, which matches your LTV figure. That confirms your unit economics.

Your confidence is noted, but let's be realistic about what $50 CAC requires. At $200 monthly subscription, you need roughly 25% conversion efficiency from qualified lead to customer - that's exceptional for B2B SaaS where 2-5% is typical.

To hit this target, you'll need surgical audience targeting and high-converting channels. The math works if execution is flawless, but there's little margin for error.

What's your current customer acquisition cost from existing channels, if any?

Turn 5:
Perfect context. You're currently at $150-175 CAC and targeting $50 - that's a 67-71% efficiency improvement needed. That's a massive leap requiring fundamental changes to your approach.

The gap from $150 to $50 suggests your current LinkedIn + webinar strategy isn't optimized for efficiency. You'll need channels with lower CPCs, better conversion rates, or both.

Before we design the new approach, I need to understand your current conversion funnel. What's your lead-to-customer conversion rate from your existing LinkedIn campaigns?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent news! Let me recalculate. $750K / 10,000 customers = $75 CAC. That's 50% more breathing room and much more realistic for B2B SaaS.

At $75 CAC vs your current $150-175, you need a 50-57% efficiency improvement instead of 71%. Still aggressive but achievable with strong optimization.

This changes our strategy significantly - we now have budget for broader channel testing and can afford some learning costs while optimizing. The extra $250K also allows for upper-funnel investment that could improve long-term efficiency.

Do you want to stick with the 10,000 customer target, or does the additional budget open up a larger volume opportunity?

Turn 7:
Smart thinking. Precision over volume shows strategic maturity. 

With $750K for 10,000 customers, you have $75 CAC target plus meaningful optimization budget. This positions you to potentially beat $75 and bank efficiency gains for future scaling.

The extra $250K creates a 33% buffer for channel testing, creative iteration, and learning costs - exactly what's needed to bridge from your current $150-175 to the $75 target.

Your economics are now solid: $75 CAC against $2,400 LTV gives you a healthy 32:1 ratio with room to optimize. Let's move to audience definition.

Who is your ideal customer within the mid-market analytics space?

Turn 8:
Excellent targeting framework. Mid-market, growth-stage companies with established data needs but seeking simplicity - that's a well-defined segment.

Let me dig deeper on the decision-maker dynamics. You mentioned heads of operations, VPs of strategy, and CTOs. In your current customer base, which of these roles typically initiates the buying process versus who ultimately approves the purchase?

Understanding the primary influencer helps optimize our messaging and channel selection.

Turn 9:
Perfect insight. VP of Strategy as initiator, CTO as closer - that's a dual-persona funnel requiring different messaging approaches.

This creates an interesting targeting challenge: VPs of Strategy respond to business impact messaging (efficiency, growth insights), while CTOs need technical proof points (integration ease, security, implementation speed).

Given this dynamic, are you typically running separate campaigns for each persona, or trying to address both in unified messaging? And which persona converts faster from initial engagement to qualified opportunity?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
That confirms the efficiency issue. Unified messaging dilutes impact for both personas - VPs of Strategy don't need technical depth, CTOs don't care about high-level business benefits.

Your insight about VP of Strategy converting faster is crucial. They're your entry point but not your closer. This suggests a sequential approach: capture VPs of Strategy first with business-focused messaging, then nurture them with CTO-focused technical content.

For geography, are you targeting specific regions, or is this a national/global campaign? Mid-market concentration varies significantly by market.

Turn 11:
Smart geographic focus. Tech-heavy regions give you higher mid-market density and audiences already comfortable with SaaS adoption.

Bay Area, Seattle, and Toronto are premium markets with higher CPCs but also higher deal velocity. Your existing penetration there suggests good product-market fit in those regions.

Given your $750K budget and 10,000 customer target, how do you want to allocate geographically? Are you looking to double down on your strong markets (Bay Area/Seattle/Toronto) for efficiency, expand to similar tech hubs like Austin or Boston, or test broader geographic reach?

Turn 12:
Excellent allocation strategy. 70-80% in proven markets maximizes efficiency while 20-30% in expansion markets tests scalability - that's textbook portfolio approach.

Austin and Boston are smart choices - similar tech density and mid-market concentration as your core markets. This geographic split gives you roughly $525-600K for core markets and $150-225K for expansion testing.

Now let's define your value proposition. You mentioned "actionable insights without massive implementation overhead" to data-driven companies. What's your core differentiator versus competitors like Tableau, Looker, or other mid-market analytics tools?

Turn 13:
Perfect differentiation. "Speed to insight" versus "time to complexity" - that's compelling for mid-market companies caught between basic tools and enterprise solutions.

"Under an hour" implementation is a powerful proof point, especially against competitors requiring weeks. This directly addresses your target audience's pain point of needing sophistication without overhead.

For messaging framework, this suggests two tracks: VP of Strategy messaging focuses on "faster business decisions" and "immediate ROI," while CTO messaging emphasizes "seamless integration" and "minimal technical lift."

Now let's build your channel strategy. With $750K budget, dual personas, and geographic focus on tech hubs, what channels are you considering beyond LinkedIn and webinars?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 15:
That's a critical gap. With dual personas and multi-channel strategy, basic last-click attribution will mislead optimization decisions. You'll likely under-invest in upper-funnel channels that influence CTOs and over-invest in bottom-funnel channels that get conversion credit.

For B2B SaaS with long sales cycles, you need multi-touch attribution plus deal-level tracking. This means connecting marketing touchpoints to specific opportunities in your CRM and tracking persona engagement patterns.

Quick measurement priority: can you implement first-party tracking to connect VP Strategy initial engagement to eventual CTO involvement in the same deal? This visibility is essential for optimizing your sequential targeting approach.

What's your current sales cycle length from first marketing touch to closed deal?

Turn 16:
Perfect timing. 45-60 day sales cycles with dual-persona involvement means multiple touchpoints across channels - exactly where attribution blindness kills optimization.

Here's what matters most: track persona progression (VP Strategy → CTO) and channel assist patterns. Without this, you'll optimize for last-click metrics that don't reflect true channel value.

For testing strategy, let's start with controlled experiments. With your $750K budget, you can afford proper test/control setups to measure incrementality versus just correlation.

What's your biggest concern about scaling from your current $150-175 CAC down to the $75 target? Is it channel performance, conversion rates, or competition driving up costs?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 14:
Excellent channel thinking. You're mapping channels to personas and behavior - that's the foundation of efficient targeting.

Let me model your allocation. With $750K and dual-persona strategy:

**Core markets (70% = $525K):**
- LinkedIn + Search for VP Strategy business intent
- GitHub/Stack Overflow for CTO technical targeting
- Podcast sponsorships for thought leadership

**Expansion markets (20-30% = $150-225K):**
- Search + LinkedIn to test persona response
- Display for broader awareness

The key is measurement. How will you track which channels drive VP Strategy leads versus CTO engagement, and more importantly, which combinations produce closed deals?
