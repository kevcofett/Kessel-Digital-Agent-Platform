# Media Plan Output: Efficiency Shock

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by checking your efficiency target. $750K ÷ 15,000 applications = $50 per application. With $2,800 LTV, that's a 56:1 LTV:CAC ratio - extremely strong for insurance where 10-20:1 is typical.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 15,000 applications? Are you focused on premium growth, market share expansion, or something else?

Turn 2:
Thank you for that critical correction. Let me recalculate with realistic insurance economics.

At $120 per application (your industry floor), you'd need $1.8M for 15,000 applications. With your $750K budget, you're looking at about 6,250 applications maximum.

This creates a fundamental gap: either increase budget to $1.8M or adjust target to ~6,250 applications.

Given your $2,800 LTV, even $120 CAC delivers 23:1 returns - still excellent. The math works, but the volume doesn't match your budget.

What's more important to your business outcome - hitting the 15,000 application volume or staying within the $750K budget constraint?

Turn 3:
Perfect - 15,000 applications is locked. That means we need to find paths to better efficiency or secure more budget.

Let me frame the challenge: you need 87.5% better efficiency than your $120 floor to hit $50 per application. That's aggressive but not impossible with the right approach.

Before we explore efficiency tactics, I need to understand your success definition. When you say "15,000 new policy applications," what exactly counts as success? 

Are you measuring:
- Total applications submitted (regardless of approval)
- Qualified applications that meet underwriting criteria
- Applications that convert to issued policies
- Something else?

This affects our efficiency calculation significantly - qualified leads vs. raw applications can be 3-5x different in cost.

Turn 6:
I apologize - I see you're repeating this correction, but I already acknowledged it and we've moved past this point. You confirmed $120 per qualified application is realistic, that you need 15,000 qualified applications meeting strict underwriting criteria, and you're interested in the hybrid awareness + direct response approach.

I was asking about your ultimate business outcome to properly model the hybrid strategy. Are you driving toward:

- Premium revenue growth from new policies
- Market share expansion in specific segments  
- Customer base growth for cross-sell opportunities

What business outcome is driving your locked 15,000 application target?

Turn 7:
Perfect - premium revenue growth through 15,000 qualified applications from your core 35-60 family demographic. That's our Step 1 complete.

Now for the economics reality check. You need $1.8M at $120 per qualified application, but have $750K budget. That's a $1.05M gap.

For the hybrid approach to work, awareness tactics would need to warm prospects enough to improve your direct response efficiency significantly. Based on insurance benchmarks, this typically improves performance by 15-25%, not the 87.5% needed to close your gap.

This means you'll likely need additional budget beyond $750K. How much flexibility do you have to secure more budget, or should we model scenarios showing what's achievable at different budget levels?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
I understand - you already corrected me on this. At $120 per qualified application minimum, you need $1.8M for 15,000 applications but only have $750K budget.

Since you confirmed the 15,000 applications is locked, we have three paths forward:

1. **Secure additional budget** - Need $1.05M more to hit realistic efficiency
2. **Hybrid approach** - Mix lower-cost awareness tactics with direct response to improve blended efficiency  
3. **Extended timeline** - Spread the 15,000 target across longer period with current budget

Before we explore which path works best, I need to clarify what counts in your 15,000 target. Are you measuring:
- Qualified applications that meet underwriting criteria
- Total applications submitted (including unqualified)
- Issued policies after underwriting

This distinction affects whether we're solving for $120 qualified leads or potentially lower-cost raw applications.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 5:
Got it - 15,000 qualified applications meeting strict underwriting criteria. That confirms we're working with your $120 floor for quality leads.

The hybrid approach could work by creating a funnel where awareness tactics feed warmer prospects to direct response channels, improving blended efficiency.

However, before I model the hybrid strategy, I need to understand what business outcome you're ultimately driving toward. You mentioned growth targets are locked - are you focused on:

- Premium revenue growth from new policies
- Market share expansion in specific segments  
- Customer base growth for cross-sell opportunities
- Something else driving the 15,000 target

This shapes how we balance awareness investment versus immediate conversion focus in the hybrid model.

Turn 8:
Absolutely. Let me model realistic scenarios for SecureLife:

**SCENARIO 1: Current $750K Budget**
- Applications achievable: 6,250 (at $120 each)
- Gap: 8,750 applications short of target
- Premium impact: Missing ~58% of growth target

**SCENARIO 2: $1.2M Budget (+$450K)**
- Applications achievable: 10,000
- Gap: 5,000 applications short
- Gets you 67% of target with moderate increase

**SCENARIO 3: $1.5M Budget (+$750K)**
- Applications achievable: 12,500  
- Gap: 2,500 applications short
- Gets you 83% of target - much closer

**SCENARIO 4: Full $1.8M Budget (+$1.05M)**
- Applications achievable: 15,000
- Hits target exactly at industry-standard efficiency

Which scenario feels most realistic for executive approval, or should I model the hybrid approach at one of these budget levels to see if we can squeeze better efficiency?

Turn 9:
Perfect - $1.2M budget targeting 10,000 qualified applications feels achievable for executive approval.

For the hybrid approach to work at this level, we need to understand your current acquisition mix. The efficiency gains come from awareness tactics warming prospects before they hit direct response channels.

What's your current breakdown between:
- Direct response (search, social direct, display retargeting)
- Brand awareness efforts  
- Referral/word-of-mouth

And do you have first-party data from existing policyholders we could leverage for lookalike targeting? High-quality customer data typically improves efficiency by 20-30% versus cold prospecting in insurance.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 11:
Perfect audience definition - mid-career professionals in stable industries, $125-250K household income, married with school-age children, planning-focused but not risk-averse.

That profile is highly targetable across channels and your 50,000 policyholder database should create excellent lookalike models for this demographic.

Now for geography - where are these target customers concentrated? Are you looking to:

- Focus on specific metro areas where your best customers cluster
- Go national across all markets  
- Target specific regions or states

Insurance regulations and your distribution network might influence this. What geographic scope makes sense for SecureLife's growth strategy?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 10:
Excellent - that 80/20 split toward direct response and your 50,000 policyholder database are key advantages for the hybrid approach.

Here's the efficiency opportunity: your current mix is hitting diminishing returns on direct response. Shifting to 60% direct response / 40% awareness (using lookalike modeling from your policyholder data) typically improves blended efficiency by 20-25% in insurance.

At $1.2M with 25% efficiency improvement:
- Effective cost drops to ~$96 per application
- Projects to 12,500 applications vs. 10,000 baseline
- Gets you 83% of target instead of 67%

However, this assumes your lookalike audiences perform well and awareness investment actually warms prospects effectively.

Before we model the channel mix, I need to understand your audience definition better. Within that 35-60 family demographic, are there specific characteristics or behaviors that define your highest-value policyholders?

Turn 12:
Excellent - maintaining nationwide presence while doubling down on your core Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Midwest markets makes strategic sense.

Those states (MA, NY, NJ, PA, IL) have high concentrations of your target demographic and likely better cost efficiency due to audience density. This geographic focus could improve your blended efficiency by another 10-15% beyond the hybrid approach gains.

Combined opportunity:
- Hybrid awareness/direct response: 20-25% efficiency gain
- Geographic concentration: 10-15% additional gain  
- Potential blended efficiency: $80-85 per application
- At $1.2M budget: 14,000-15,000 applications possible

This could actually get you to your full 15,000 target within the $1.2M budget.

Before we model the budget allocation, what percentage of your current $750K is already focused on those core five states versus spread nationally?

Turn 13:
Perfect - you're already concentrating 60-65% in your best markets, which validates the geographic efficiency opportunity.

Let me update our projections. With $1.2M budget and tighter geographic focus on those core states (pushing to 75-80% concentration), plus the hybrid approach leveraging your policyholder lookalikes, we're looking at:

- Geographic concentration boost: 10-15% efficiency gain
- Hybrid awareness/direct response: 20-25% efficiency gain
- Combined efficiency improvement: 30-40%
- Effective cost per application: $85-95
- Projected applications: 12,600-14,100

This gets you 84-94% of your 15,000 target - much closer to goal within the $1.2M budget.

Now let's lock in the budget allocation. How should we split the $1.2M between:
- Core 5 states (MA, NY, NJ, PA, IL)
- Remaining national presence
- Any specific metro priorities within those core states?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 15:
Perfect - that advisor expertise and holistic financial partnership positioning is a strong differentiator for your professional audience.

This value proposition shapes your hybrid strategy significantly. The awareness portion should build trust in your advisory expertise, while direct response captures intent around financial protection needs.

Now let's build your channel mix within that $1.2M budget:

**Core Markets ($960K):**
- LinkedIn (advisor thought leadership + direct response): 35% = $336K
- Search (financial planning keywords): 30% = $288K  
- Precision display (lookalike targeting): 20% = $192K
- Retargeting/nurture: 15% = $144K

**National presence ($240K):**
- Brand awareness and light retargeting

Does this 35/30/20/15 split feel right for your objectives, or should we adjust the LinkedIn investment given your advisor expertise positioning?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 14:
Excellent allocation - $960K concentrated in your core metros will drive much better efficiency than spreading nationally.

That 80/20 geographic split plus your channel focus on LinkedIn, precision display, and professional-keyword search should deliver the efficiency gains we modeled. Your emphasis on financial planning and family security keywords is smart for capturing high-intent prospects.

Now for your value proposition development. Given your target audience of mid-career professionals who are "risk-aware but not risk-averse" and want "comprehensive financial protection," what's your primary competitive advantage?

Do you compete on:
- Product comprehensiveness and customization
- Service quality and advisor expertise  
- Price and value
- Speed and digital experience
- Something else that differentiates SecureLife in this crowded market?
