# Media Plan Output: Demographic Shift Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by updating our projections with your data. $1.5M ÷ 100K customers = $15 per customer acquisition cost. That's extremely aggressive for streetwear - typical runs $25-50 based on Knowledge Base benchmarks. At $350 LTV, your efficiency target is 23x return, which is ambitious but achievable with tight execution.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 100K new customers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect - you're building national brand presence while driving customer acquisition. That dual objective affects our strategy since brand awareness requires broader reach than pure performance targeting.

Let me clarify your primary success metric. With both brand building and customer acquisition goals, how will you measure success? Are you tracking the 100K new customers as your main KPI, or do you have brand awareness metrics like aided/unaided recall that are equally important?

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using $150 AOV with 55% margin and note that LTV needs validation as you scale nationally. You can refine these anytime.

This reveals an important challenge: $150 AOV with 55% margin = $82.50 contribution per customer. To hit $15 CAC, you need immediate profitability on first purchase, which is rare for brand building campaigns.

Most successful streetwear brands target $25-40 CAC for sustainable growth. At $25 CAC with your margins, you'd need $45K more budget ($2.5M total) or target 60K customers instead of 100K.

Which makes more sense for your brand expansion goals - adjusting budget upward or moderating the customer target?

Turn 5:
Perfect - $2.5M budget for 100K customers gives us $25 CAC, which is realistic for streetwear and allows room for both acquisition and brand building.

Your economics look solid now: $25 CAC against $82.50 first-purchase contribution gives you immediate 3.3x return, plus upside from repeat purchases as you validate that $350 LTV.

Since you're moving from regional to national presence, audience definition will be critical. You mentioned Millennials 25-40 into streetwear and urban fashion. 

What specific behaviors or interests define your ideal customer beyond age and fashion preference?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Excellent - 100K new customers as your primary KPI with brand awareness as supporting metrics. That's smart for a brand expansion play.

Now let's assess if your $15 CAC target is achievable. At $350 LTV, you have strong unit economics, but $15 is 40-67% below typical streetwear benchmarks. For brand building AND acquisition, you'll need significant reach which typically increases costs.

A few quick questions about your economics: What's your average order value and gross margin? And do you have data on repeat purchase rates that support the $350 LTV figure?

Turn 7:
Perfect - $75K-125K income with proven traction in NYC, LA, Atlanta, and Chicago. That's a strong foundation for national expansion.

Now let's define your geography strategy. You mentioned targeting top 25 DMAs. Since you're expanding from 4 proven markets to 25, we should prioritize based on streetwear culture strength and your target demographic density.

Should we structure this as your 4 core markets getting heavier investment, with the remaining 21 DMAs getting lighter test budgets? Or do you want more even distribution across all 25?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent profile - that lifestyle-driven mindset is key for streetwear targeting. Hip-hop culture, influencer following, and limited drops as identity markers give us strong behavioral signals.

A few more audience details to sharpen our targeting: 

What income level supports $150+ purchases for fashion-as-identity? And are there specific cities or regions where you've seen strongest response that might guide our national expansion strategy?

Turn 8:
Let me recalculate based on Gen Z 18-27. This is actually positive for your $25 CAC target - Gen Z typically has lower acquisition costs due to higher social media engagement and digital nativity.

However, income shifts significantly. Gen Z averages $35K-65K vs your $75K-125K Millennial target. At $150 AOV, you're asking for 2-4x their typical fashion spend per purchase. 

This creates two paths: 1) Lower AOV with more accessible price points, or 2) Position as aspirational premium purchases for higher-income Gen Z.

Which direction aligns better with your brand strategy - accessible streetwear or premium positioning?

Turn 9:
Perfect - premium aspirational positioning for Gen Z makes sense. That exclusivity angle actually supports higher AOV if executed well. Supreme and Off-White prove Gen Z will stretch budgets for cultural cache.

Your $25 CAC becomes more achievable with this strategy since premium positioning allows for higher-value creative and influencer partnerships that Gen Z responds to.

Now back to geography - with Gen Z focus, some DMAs become more attractive. Markets like Miami, Austin, and Portland have strong Gen Z streetwear scenes beyond your core 4.

For your 25 DMA strategy, should we tier the investment - heavy in proven markets, medium in high-potential Gen Z markets, and light testing in remaining DMAs?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Excellent - that ripple effect strategy leverages cultural influence perfectly. Tier 1 (NYC, LA, Atlanta, Chicago) gets heavy investment, Tier 2 (Miami, Austin, Portland) gets medium allocation, and remaining 18 DMAs get light testing budgets.

This geographic concentration actually improves your $25 CAC efficiency since you're focusing spend where Gen Z streetwear culture is strongest.

Now let's structure your $2.5M budget allocation. With 7 priority markets plus 18 test markets, how do you want to split the budget geographically? Should Tier 1 get roughly 60%, Tier 2 get 25%, and remaining markets get 15% for testing?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Perfect - $2.5M split as $1.5M for Tier 1, $625K for Tier 2, and $375K for remaining 18 DMAs. That gives you $375K per core market, $208K per Tier 2 market, and $21K per test market.

Now let's define your value proposition for Gen Z. You mentioned aspirational streetwear with cultural cache and limited drops. 

What specific message will make Gen Z choose UrbanStyle over established players like Supreme or emerging competitors? What makes your drops feel like "must-have culture" versus just premium clothing?
