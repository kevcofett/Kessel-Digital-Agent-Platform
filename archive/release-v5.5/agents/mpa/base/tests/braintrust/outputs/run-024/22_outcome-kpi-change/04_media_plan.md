# Media Plan Output: Outcome KPI Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by modeling your efficiency target. $5M ÷ 25,000 policies = $200 CAC. With $2,800 LTV, that's a strong 14:1 ratio - very healthy for insurance.

Your primary objective is policy acquisitions, but I need to understand the business impact. Are these 25,000 new policies primarily about hitting a revenue target, market share goal, or growth milestone for TrustGuard?

Turn 2:
Perfect. Market share expansion with 25,000 high-value policies at $200 CAC - that's an aggressive but achievable efficiency target for insurance.

Your primary KPI is policy acquisitions, but I need to clarify how you'll measure success. Are you tracking:

- Issued policies (customer signs and pays first premium)
- Quoted policies (customer completes application) 
- Or qualified leads (customer provides contact info for follow-up)

This affects our funnel math significantly, since insurance typically sees 15-25% conversion from quote to issued policy.

Turn 4:
Smart approach. Extended attribution captures the true economics for considered purchases like insurance.

With 90-180 day attribution, your $200 blended CAC is realistic for affluent homeowners. Based on insurance benchmarks, this positions you competitively - typical runs $150-300 for quality homeowners policies.

Now let's define your audience precisely. You mentioned homeowners 35-65, $100K+ income, during life events. To build targeting that can hit $200 CAC efficiency, I need to understand the behavioral triggers.

Which life event creates the strongest purchase intent: home purchase (immediate need for new policy), family changes (baby, marriage - coverage review), or retirement planning (asset protection focus)?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent. Issued policies at $200 CAC is our efficiency target. 

For insurance, conversion from initial interest to issued policy typically runs 8-15% due to underwriting, comparison shopping, and decision timelines. At $200 per issued policy, you're essentially paying $16-30 per initial lead or quote request.

Given insurance's longer consideration cycle and your affluent target, is this $200 efficiency based on:

- Immediate attribution (policy issued within 30 days of ad exposure)
- Extended attribution window (90-180 days to account for shopping cycles)
- Or blended across different consideration timelines

This affects how we structure measurement and optimize toward your true acquisition cost.

Turn 5:
Perfect. Home purchase is your highest-intent signal - new homeowners have immediate coverage needs and clear urgency.

For targeting precision at your $200 CAC efficiency, I need to understand the timing window. Are you targeting:

- Pre-purchase (house hunting, mortgage pre-approval phase)
- Active purchase (under contract, closing within 30-60 days)  
- Or post-purchase (recently closed, first 90 days of ownership)

Each window has different audience size and intent levels. Active purchase offers highest intent but smallest audience, while pre-purchase offers larger scale but requires longer nurturing.

Turn 7:
Perfect. Concentrating on 15-20 high-growth metros maximizes efficiency by focusing spend where your audience density is highest.

$5M across 15-20 metros means roughly $250K-330K per market - sufficient budget for meaningful market penetration and optimization.

For your budget allocation, are you planning to:

- Weight spend equally across all selected metros ($250K-330K each)
- Tier markets by opportunity size (A-tier gets $400K+, B-tier gets $200K, etc.)
- Or start with 5-8 top markets and expand based on performance

This affects how we structure testing, measurement, and scale strategy across your metro concentration approach.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Excellent targeting focus. Active purchase phase delivers optimal intent-to-scale ratio for $200 CAC efficiency.

Now for geography. With 25,000 policies nationally, we need to prioritize markets where your active home buyers are concentrated and insurance competition allows for efficient acquisition.

Are you looking to:

- Focus on high-growth metros where home sales volume is strongest (Austin, Nashville, Phoenix, etc.)
- Target markets where TrustGuard has existing brand presence or operational advantages
- Or go broad national with DMA-level targeting based purely on home purchase activity

This shapes whether we concentrate spend in 15-20 top markets or spread across 50+ DMAs.

Turn 9:
Smart hybrid approach. Let's remodel: $3M brand awareness + $2M acquisition maintains growth while addressing competitive defense.

$2M ÷ 25,000 policies = $80 CAC - extremely aggressive efficiency that requires surgical precision. At $80 vs typical $150-300, you're targeting 47-73% below market rates.

This is achievable but demands:
- Tightest possible audience targeting (active home buyers only)
- Highest-intent channels and placements
- Brand campaign creating qualified pipeline for acquisition to convert

The brand spend actually supports acquisition by warming prospects before they hit your performance funnel.

Before we design the integrated strategy, what's your definition of "15% brand awareness lift" - aided awareness among homeowners 35-65, or specifically among active home buyers in your target metros?

This affects whether brand and acquisition campaigns target the same audience or different funnels.

Turn 10:
Perfect. Unified ecosystem targeting the same homeowners 35-65 in your 15-20 metros creates campaign synergy and measurement clarity.

With geographic and demographic precision, your $3M brand budget = roughly $150K-200K per metro for awareness building. That's substantial enough for meaningful reach and frequency among your target.

Now let's define your target audience signals precisely. You mentioned homeowners 35-65, $100K+ income, active home purchase phase (under contract, 30-60 days to closing).

For both brand awareness measurement and acquisition targeting efficiency, I need the behavioral signals that identify active home buyers. Are you targeting based on:

- Mortgage application activity and real estate site behavior
- Life event signals like address changes and moving-related searches  
- Or first-party data partnerships with real estate platforms

The tighter we can define "active home buyer," the more efficient both campaigns become.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
I understand the competitive pressure, but let's think through this strategically before pivoting the entire plan.

You have $5M budgeted and 25,000 policy targets already modeled at $200 CAC - strong unit economics with your $2,800 LTV. Brand awareness is important, but it doesn't generate the revenue or market share you mentioned as core objectives.

A few critical questions: Does this brand awareness shift mean pausing the 25,000 policy goal entirely, or could we allocate budget to do both - perhaps 60% brand awareness, 40% direct acquisition? 

Also, what's the timeline pressure from this competitor entry - are we talking immediate response needed, or building awareness over 6-12 months?

The math matters here because pure brand campaigns typically cost 3-5x more per impression but don't generate measurable revenue in your attribution window.

Turn 11:
Excellent. Mortgage application + real estate behavior creates high-intent audience pools perfect for your $80 acquisition efficiency target.

Your audience strategy is taking shape: homeowners 35-65, $100K+ income, active home buyers (mortgage applications + real estate site behavior) in 15-20 high-growth metros.

For audience sizing and reach planning, what's the estimated monthly volume of active home buyers in your target metros? Are we looking at:

- 50K-100K monthly active prospects across all metros
- 100K-200K monthly prospects 
- Or larger scale that gives us room for audience segmentation

This affects whether we need broad reach for brand awareness or can layer in additional behavioral signals for both campaigns.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 12:
Perfect scale. 100K-200K monthly active prospects gives you sufficient reach for 15% brand lift while maintaining precision for $80 CAC efficiency.

Now for budget allocation across your 15-20 metros. With strong prospect volume, you can tier markets by opportunity size rather than spreading equally.

Are you planning to:

- Tier by home sales volume (Austin, Denver get $400K+ each; smaller metros get $150K)
- Weight by competitive intensity (heaviest spend where competitor is entering first)
- Or start with 8-10 top metros and expand based on brand lift + acquisition performance

This shapes whether we go deep in fewer markets or maintain broader geographic presence from launch.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 13:
Smart defensive strategy. Concentrating 60-70% of $5M ($3M-3.5M) in 8-10 high-competition metros means $300K-435K per priority market - substantial firepower for competitive defense.

This creates two budget tiers:
- Tier 1: 8-10 competitive metros at $300K-435K each
- Tier 2: 5-10 expansion metros at remaining budget

Now for your value proposition. With brand awareness AND acquisition goals in competitive markets, your messaging needs to work harder.

What's TrustGuard's key differentiator that resonates with affluent homeowners during active purchase? Is it:

- Superior coverage/protection for high-value homes
- Streamlined digital experience for busy professionals  
- Specialized expertise for complex insurance needs
- Or competitive pricing with premium service

This shapes whether brand messaging emphasizes trust, convenience, expertise, or value.

Turn 14:
Perfect positioning. "Specialized expertise for complex insurance needs" differentiates TrustGuard from commodity competitors and justifies premium consideration among affluent buyers.

Your value proposition - white-glove, consultative solutions for high-value properties and life transitions - creates natural messaging bridge between brand awareness ("TrustGuard understands complex needs") and acquisition ("Get expert consultation for your new home").

Now for channels. With $3M brand + $2M acquisition across 8-10 competitive metros, we need channels that can deliver both awareness reach and high-intent conversion.

Given your specialized expertise positioning and active home buyer targeting, what channels are you considering? Are you leaning toward:

- Digital-first approach (programmatic display, paid social, search)
- Traditional + digital mix (local TV, radio, plus digital)
- Or premium placements that reinforce expertise positioning (financial media, real estate platforms)
