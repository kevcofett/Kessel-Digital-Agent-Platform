# Media Plan Output: Sophisticated User - IDK Protocol

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start modeling your efficiency target. $500K ÷ 10,000 users = $50 per user acquisition. For remittance fintech, that's aggressive - typical CAC runs $75-150 based on industry benchmarks.

What specific business outcome are you targeting beyond user acquisition? Are you focused on transaction volume, active users, or revenue growth?

Turn 2:
Perfect. Transaction volume and active engagement is your business outcome. At $50 CAC vs. typical $75-150, you're targeting 33-67% better efficiency - definitely aggressive but achievable with tight execution.

For remittance, success typically tracks monthly active users who transact, not just signups. What's your primary KPI for measuring success? Is it monthly active transacting users, total transaction volume, or average revenue per user?

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using reasonable assumptions so we can move forward. For remittance platforms, active users typically complete 2-4 transactions monthly, with average transaction size around $300-500. At 2.5% fee (midpoint of your range), that's $15-50 monthly revenue per active user.

Using conservative estimates: $25 monthly revenue per user means $50 CAC pays back in 2 months - very healthy for fintech. You can refine these numbers anytime as your data improves.

Your economics look feasible if you can hit the $50 efficiency target. The challenge is execution - remittance users are often price-sensitive and have strong existing habits.

Ready to define your target audience to build a plan that can achieve this aggressive CAC?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - monthly active transacting users is a strong KPI that connects acquisition to business value. 

To validate your $50 efficiency target, I need to understand your unit economics. What's your average transaction fee percentage, and roughly how many transactions does a typical active user complete per month?

This will help assess if $50 CAC generates positive unit economics within a reasonable payback period.

Turn 5:
Perfect foundation - diaspora communities in major metros is smart targeting. To hit your aggressive $50 CAC, we need precision beyond just demographics.

Let me map key targeting signals:

**Demographics**: 25-45 years old, household income $40K-80K, employed
**Geographic**: NYC, LA, SF, Houston, Dallas, Miami metro areas
**Behavioral**: Regular international communication, existing remittance usage, price-conscious financial decisions

For the psychographic precision you need, what specific countries or regions do your users primarily send money to? This dramatically affects targeting - someone sending to Mexico has different media consumption than someone sending to Philippines or Nigeria.

Also, are you targeting people already using competitors like Western Union, or trying to capture people new to formal remittance services?
