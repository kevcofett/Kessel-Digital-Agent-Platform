TURN 1 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I'm the Director of Performance Marketing at LuxeFinance, a wealth management firm. We need to build a precision media plan to acquire high-net-worth individuals - specifically people with $1M+ in investable assets, typically 45-65, executives and business owners who are either approaching retirement or have a major liquidity event coming up. We're interested in people researching tax optimization and estate planning. Budget is $1.5M, targeting 2,500 qualified leads. We have CRM data on 50K existing clients we can use for modeling. Focus on top DMAs by HNW concentration - NYC, SF, LA, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Denver, Miami, Dallas, DC. Quality matters more than volume here.

AGENT:
Hi! I am excited to build a media plan with you. We will cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've outlined a sophisticated acquisition strategy. Let me clarify the primary business outcome: Are you targeting 2,500 qualified leads that convert to initial consultations, or are you measuring success by actual new client acquisitions from this campaign?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 2 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're ultimately looking for new client acquisitions. Those 2,500 leads are a milestone, but our true north is converting those leads into actual wealth management clients with meaningful AUM. Our CRM data suggests our typical consultation-to-client conversion is around 15-20%, so we're hoping to land 375-500 net new clients from this campaign.

AGENT:
Perfect. Let me update our projections. 2,500 leads converting at 15-20% = 375-500 new clients. That's $1.5M / 375-500 = $3,000-4,000 per acquired client.

For wealth management targeting $1M+ investable assets, that efficiency is actually conservative - industry benchmarks typically run $5,000-12,000 CAC for qualified HNW clients. Your target suggests strong conversion infrastructure.

What's the average AUM per new client relationship you typically establish? This helps validate whether $3K-4K acquisition cost delivers acceptable LTV ratios.

TURN 3 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our average new client brings in about $5-7M in AUM, which at our typical fee structure of around 75 basis points, translates to $37,500-$52,500 in annual recurring revenue. So even at the lower end, we're looking at a very attractive LTV:CAC ratio - roughly 10:1 if we can consistently acquire clients at $3-4K. Our existing client data and referral network also suggest these clients tend to be sticky, with multi-year relationships.

AGENT:
Excellent. $37.5K-52.5K annual revenue at $3K-4K CAC delivers 9-17x first-year ROAS with strong retention upside. That's compelling unit economics for HNW acquisition.

Your efficiency target is achievable but requires precision targeting. At $3K CAC versus $5K-12K benchmarks, you're targeting 40-75% better than typical. With your first-party data from 50K clients, this is realistic through tight lookalike modeling.

One critical factor: What's your typical sales cycle from qualified lead to signed client? HNW decisions often take 3-6 months, which affects attribution windows and campaign optimization timing.

Events: benchmark_cited, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 4 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our sales cycle typically runs about 4-5 months from initial consultation to signed client. These are complex relationships - our prospects are evaluating not just performance, but our entire wealth management philosophy, tax strategy, and personal chemistry with our advisors. We're not selling a product, we're establishing a long-term financial partnership. That longer cycle means we need media tactics that can nurture leads and maintain engagement throughout that evaluation period.

AGENT:
Got it. The 4-5 month cycle creates attribution challenges and requires sustained nurture. Most platforms optimize on 7-30 day windows, but your true value emerges months later. This demands incrementality measurement and lead scoring rather than platform ROAS.

Your economics are solid: $1.5M budget targeting $3K-4K CAC is achievable with precision targeting. The 4-5 month cycle means we'll need multi-touch attribution and content strategies that maintain engagement through the consideration period.

Moving to Step 3 - Audience. You've outlined strong targeting criteria. Beyond the $1M+ assets and 45-65 age range, what behavioral signals best identify prospects in active evaluation? Are they researching specific topics, experiencing life events, or showing other intent signals we can target?

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 5 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
From our first-party data, we see strong intent signals around specific life transitions - pre-IPO tech executives, business owners exploring exit strategies, professionals receiving significant inheritance or experiencing major liquidity events. Our CRM shows they're actively researching topics like tax-efficient wealth transfer, retirement income optimization, and estate planning strategies. LinkedIn engagement and search behavior around "tax strategy for business sale" or "wealth management for executives" tend to be highly predictive of our ideal prospect profile.

AGENT:
Excellent behavioral signals. Life transitions create urgency that shortens consideration cycles. Pre-IPO executives and business owners planning exits have defined timelines that improve conversion probability.

Your first-party data on 50K clients is valuable for lookalike modeling across these transition moments. The search intent around "tax strategy for business sale" and "wealth management for executives" provides targetable keyword themes.

For audience sizing in your target DMAs - do you have estimates on your addressable market? Specifically, how many HNW individuals meeting your criteria exist across NYC, SF, LA, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Denver, Miami, Dallas, and DC combined?

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 6 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We've estimated roughly 150,000-200,000 HNW individuals across those DMAs who match our precise targeting criteria. Our internal research suggests about 30-40% of those are actively in transition or researching wealth management solutions at any given time. So we're looking at a realistic addressable market of around 45,000-80,000 prospects that we could effectively engage with our media strategy.

AGENT:
Perfect. 45K-80K active prospects targeting 2,500 leads = 3-6% conversion from addressable to qualified lead. That's aggressive but achievable with precision targeting and your transition-focused messaging.

$1.5M across 45K-80K prospects = $19-33 spend per prospect. For HNW targeting, that provides sufficient frequency to maintain presence throughout their 4-5 month consideration cycle.

Moving to Step 4 - Geography. You've identified the key HNW DMAs. Should we weight spend equally across all ten markets, or do you want to prioritize based on HNW concentration, your existing client presence, or competitive landscape in specific markets?

Events: calculation_performed

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 7 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We should definitely not weight spend equally. San Francisco and New York Metro are our highest priority markets - they represent about 40% of our total addressable market, with the highest concentration of tech executives and business owners experiencing significant liquidity events. I'd recommend allocating close to 50-55% of our budget to those two markets, with a secondary tier of focus on Boston, Los Angeles, and Chicago. The remaining markets can receive smaller, more tactical allocations. Our existing client data shows these top markets also have the highest conversion rates and lowest customer acquisition costs.

AGENT:
Excellent prioritization. SF and NYC at 50-55% allocation = $750K-825K targeting your highest-converting markets. That's $375K-412K per market for sustained presence during 4-5 month cycles.

Secondary tier (Boston, LA, Chicago) would receive roughly $450K-525K combined, leaving $225K-300K for tactical presence in remaining markets. This concentration strategy maximizes efficiency where conversion data proves strongest.

Moving to Step 5 - Budget. Within your $1.5M total, how do you want to allocate between acquisition channels versus nurture/retention tactics? Given your 4-5 month sales cycle, some budget should support lead nurture through that consideration period.

Events: calculation_performed, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 8 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I'd recommend a 70/30 split - roughly $1.05M for direct acquisition and $450K for lead nurture and retention. Our long sales cycle means we can't just focus on top-of-funnel tactics. We need sophisticated retargeting, personalized content, and nurture streams that keep prospects engaged through their 4-5 month evaluation. The nurture budget will be critical for maintaining mindshare and moving qualified leads toward consultation.

AGENT:
Perfect allocation. $1.05M acquisition + $450K nurture aligns with your extended sales cycle needs. At 2,500 target leads, that's $420 per lead for initial acquisition plus $180 per lead for sustained nurture - appropriate for HNW complexity.

The 70/30 split recognizes that closing HNW clients requires relationship building, not just lead generation. Your nurture budget supports multi-touch engagement through their evaluation period.

Moving to Step 6 - Value Proposition. Given your sophisticated audience of executives and business owners in transition, what core value proposition resonates most with prospects during their research phase? Is it expertise in specific transitions, tax optimization capabilities, or something else that differentiates LuxeFinance?

Events: calculation_performed, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 9 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our core value proposition is precision wealth architecture for complex transitions. We're not just managing assets, we're engineering comprehensive financial strategies that optimize tax efficiency, protect generational wealth, and provide white-glove strategic guidance during critical life moments. Our differentiator is our ability to design holistic financial solutions that go far beyond traditional wealth management - we're essentially financial architects who understand the nuanced needs of high-performing executives and business owners experiencing significant liquidity events.

AGENT:
Excellent positioning. "Precision wealth architecture for complex transitions" speaks directly to your audience's sophistication and situational urgency. The "financial architects" framing elevates you beyond asset managers to strategic advisors.

This value proposition aligns perfectly with your targeting of transition moments - pre-IPO, business exits, inheritance events. It positions complexity as expertise rather than burden, which resonates with executives who value strategic thinking.

Moving to Step 7 - Channels. Given your $1.05M acquisition budget, sophisticated audience, and need for precision targeting, which channels do you see as primary for reaching HNW prospects in research mode? LinkedIn seems obvious given your executive targeting, but what's your thinking on the optimal channel mix?
