# Media Plan Output: Mass National Campaign - Simplicity Test

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

For your national snack launch, I need to clarify the business outcome you're targeting. Brand awareness is the strategy, but what specific business result are you trying to achieve? Are you looking to drive trial purchases, increase market share in the snack category, or establish FreshBite as a recognized brand before rolling out additional products?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your business outcome is establishing brand credibility and recognition in the snack category to drive awareness and consideration.

For measuring success, you mentioned brand lift studies. What specific number are you targeting? For example, are you aiming for a certain percentage increase in aided brand awareness, unaided awareness, or purchase consideration among your target audience?

Turn 4:
Got it - 50-60 million active snack purchasers with urban/suburban focus. Let me model your efficiency target.

$8M budget targeting 15% awareness lift among 55M people = 8.25M people aware of FreshBite. That's $0.97 per person reached with awareness lift.

For snack brands, awareness campaigns typically run $0.50-1.50 per person reached, so your target is right in the sweet spot - aggressive but achievable.

Since this is brand awareness rather than direct sales, we don't need traditional unit economics like customer acquisition cost. Your success comes from the awareness and consideration lifts you're measuring.

This efficiency looks realistic for a national brand launch. Ready to move to defining your audience more precisely?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - 15-20% aided awareness lift and 10% consideration lift are solid targets for a new brand launch. Those numbers give us clear success metrics to work toward.

Now I need to understand the volume behind those percentages. What's the size of your target market? For example, if you're targeting adults 18-54 who buy snacks nationally, that's roughly 150 million people. Are you looking to reach that full population, or do you have a more specific addressable market size in mind?

Turn 5:
Great! For a brand awareness campaign targeting 50-60M people, we need 5-10 key targeting signals that balance reach with relevance.

Let's start with behavioral signals since these are most predictive for snack purchasing. Within your 18-54 adult audience, what specific snacking behaviors matter most? For example:

- Premium snack buyers vs. value-focused shoppers
- Health-conscious snackers vs. indulgent treat seekers  
- Convenience store purchasers vs. grocery/bulk buyers
- On-the-go snacking vs. at-home consumption

Which of these behavioral patterns best describes your ideal FreshBite customer?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Perfect - health-conscious premium buyers who value on-the-go nutrition without sacrificing taste. That's a strong positioning.

Let me add demographics to refine this further. Within your 18-54 range, are there specific age segments that over-index for premium health-conscious snacking? For instance, do you see stronger opportunity with younger millennials (25-35) building healthy habits, or established professionals (35-50) with higher disposable income for premium products?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Perfect - ingredient transparency and convenience without compromise. That gives us clear messaging pillars for the creative strategy.

One final audience signal: where do these health-conscious professionals typically discover and purchase premium snacks? Are they shopping primarily at:

- Premium grocery chains (Whole Foods, Fresh Market)
- Mainstream grocery with natural/organic sections
- Convenience stores near offices/gyms
- Online/subscription services
- Specialty health food retailers

Understanding their shopping behavior will help us align media channels with where they're already engaged with premium snack brands.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Excellent targeting - adults 30-45, health-conscious professionals with premium purchasing power and on-the-go lifestyles. That's a well-defined core audience.

Now for psychographic signals that will help with creative messaging and channel selection. Within this group, what motivates their snack choices? Are they primarily driven by:

- Functional benefits (energy, protein, specific nutrients)
- Lifestyle alignment (fits their active/professional image)
- Ingredient transparency (clean labels, organic, non-GMO)
- Convenience without compromise (healthy but still satisfying)

Which of these motivational drivers resonates most with how FreshBite positions against competitors?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Excellent - mainstream grocery natural sections and online subscription services, with office convenience stores as secondary. That shopping pattern gives us clear channel alignment opportunities.

Your audience definition is solid: Adults 30-45, health-conscious professionals, premium purchasers, motivated by ingredient transparency and convenience, shopping primarily at mainstream grocery natural sections and online services.

Now let's move to geography. You mentioned targeting urban and suburban markets nationally. Within your 50-60M target audience, are there specific metropolitan areas or regions where health-conscious premium snacking over-indexes? For example, do you see stronger opportunity in health-forward markets like West Coast cities, or is your target audience distributed more evenly across major metros nationwide?

Turn 10:
Perfect - priority metros on West Coast and Northeast with national scalability. That's smart market entry strategy.

For budget allocation across geography, should we weight investment toward those high-opportunity metros initially, or spread the $8M evenly for true national reach? 

For example, we could allocate 60% to priority metros (SF, Seattle, Boston, NYC, Denver, Chicago) and 40% to secondary markets, or go with a more even national distribution. What approach aligns better with your launch strategy?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 11:
Excellent - 60% to priority metros ($4.8M) and 40% national ($3.2M). That gives you concentrated impact in high-opportunity markets while building national presence.

Let me model the geographic efficiency: Your priority metros contain roughly 35M of your 55M target audience. $4.8M targeting 15% awareness lift among 35M = 5.25M aware at $0.91 per person. The remaining $3.2M covers 20M people nationally = 3M aware at $1.07 per person. Both rates are within your $0.50-1.50 benchmark range.

Your budget allocation is realistic and should deliver your awareness targets across both geographic tiers. Ready to dive into your value proposition and messaging framework?

Turn 12:
Perfect! Now let's build your value proposition framework. You've established "clean, convenient nutrition" as your core positioning for health-conscious professionals who value ingredient transparency and convenience without compromise.

For your primary value proposition, which benefit should lead your messaging hierarchy:

- **Ingredient transparency first**: "Know exactly what you're eating" - leading with clean labels, quality ingredients, no artificial additives
- **Convenience first**: "Nutrition that fits your life" - leading with busy professional lifestyle, grab-and-go ease
- **Quality without compromise**: "Finally, healthy that tastes amazing" - leading with the idea that you don't sacrifice taste for nutrition

Which benefit resonates most strongly with how FreshBite differentiates from both traditional snacks and other better-for-you options?
