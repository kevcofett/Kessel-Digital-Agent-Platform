# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience Unified Media Plan

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I am excited to build a media plan with you. We will cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Your setup is sophisticated - three distinct segments with $3M targeting 25,000 enrollees. Let me start with the foundation.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 25,000 new enrollees? Is this about hitting enrollment targets, revenue growth, market share expansion, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect. Market share expansion across strategic segments is your objective. Now I need to define success measurement.

$3M / 25,000 enrollees = $120 per enrollment. For health insurance, that's quite efficient - industry typically runs $150-250 per enrollment based on benchmarks.

What's your primary success metric? Is it total enrollments, cost per enrollment under $120, or something like first-year premium revenue from these new members?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent. Total enrollments with sub-$120 CAC is clear and achievable based on industry benchmarks.

Let me validate the economics: At $120 per enrollment, you're targeting 37% better efficiency than typical $150-250 range. This is aggressive but realistic with tight targeting across your three segments.

What's the average annual premium value for a new enrollee? This helps assess if $120 acquisition cost makes economic sense against customer lifetime value.

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using $4,750 average annual premium based on your range. At $120 acquisition cost versus $4,750 annual value, that's a 40:1 ratio - excellent unit economics even with modest retention.

Your $120 target is definitely achievable with this value profile. The strong economics give us flexibility in targeting precision.

Now let's move to audience definition. You've outlined three distinct segments well. Starting with Young Professionals (26-35, urban metros) - beyond demographics and location, what behavioral or psychographic signals best identify your ideal young professional prospects?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Excellent behavioral depth. Young Professionals have strong digital signals for targeting.

For the Family segment (35-50, suburban, parents with kids under 18) - what behavioral signals beyond parenting status help identify your ideal family prospects? Are there specific activities, interests, or life events that signal they're in-market for health insurance changes?

Turn 6:
Perfect. Family segment has clear life-stage and planning-focused signals.

For Pre-Medicare (55-64, national with FL/AZ/TX concentration) - what behavioral signals indicate they're actively considering health insurance changes? Are there specific retirement planning activities or health-related concerns that make them receptive to your messaging?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Excellent. All three segments have distinct behavioral profiles for targeting.

Now for geography - you mentioned urban metros for Young Professionals, suburban markets around top 50 metros for Families, and national with FL/AZ/TX concentration for Pre-Medicare.

Do you have specific DMA priorities within these regions, or should we focus budget allocation based on population density and your current market penetration in these areas?

Turn 8:
Perfect geographic focus. Heavy concentration makes sense for efficiency.

Let me model your $3M budget allocation. You have three distinct segments with different targeting precision and market dynamics:

- Young Professionals: High-value, concentrated metros, strong digital signals
- Families: Suburban reach, life-stage triggers, moderate concentration  
- Pre-Medicare: Florida priority, national scale, established behaviors

Should we weight budget allocation equally at $1M per segment, or do you want to prioritize based on strategic value or conversion potential?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Excellent allocation strategy. Let me validate the math:

- Young Professionals: $1.2M targeting ~10,000 enrollees = $120 CAC
- Families: $1.05M targeting ~8,750 enrollees = $120 CAC  
- Pre-Medicare: $750K targeting ~6,250 enrollees = $120 CAC

This maintains your $120 efficiency target across all segments while prioritizing growth segments.

Now for value proposition development. Each segment has different motivations. For Young Professionals focused on convenience and holistic wellness - what's your core value proposition that differentiates TrueHealth from competitors in this space?

Turn 10:
Strong value prop - "Wellness Made Simple" with ecosystem benefits resonates perfectly with their behavioral signals.

For Families concerned about comprehensive coverage and cost predictability - how does TrueHealth's value proposition address their planning-focused mindset and need for stability?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Perfect - "Predictable Protection, Personalized Care" addresses their core concerns about stability and comprehensive family coverage.

For Pre-Medicare focused on stability, network quality, and Medicare transition - what's TrueHealth's value proposition that speaks to their bridge-to-Medicare needs and desire for continuity?
