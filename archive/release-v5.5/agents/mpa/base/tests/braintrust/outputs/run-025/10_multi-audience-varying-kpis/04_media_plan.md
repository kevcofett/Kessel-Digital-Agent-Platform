# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience with Different KPIs Per Segment

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build this multi-segment media plan with you. This is a sophisticated challenge - three distinct objectives with different measurement frameworks across conquest, in-market, and loyalty segments.

We'll cover our ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last, but we'll adapt for your three-segment structure.

Let's start with Segment 1 - Conquest (Awareness). You mentioned the goal is awareness for future consideration, not immediate leads. What's your primary KPI for measuring awareness success? Are you targeting reach/frequency thresholds, brand lift percentages, or consideration shift metrics?

Turn 2:
Perfect. 15-20% brand consideration lift over 12 months with broad metro reach - that's your Segment 1 success framework.

Let me model the economics. $4.5M × 35% = $1.575M for conquest awareness.

Brand lift campaigns typically require $15-25 CPM for quality reach at scale. For 15-20% consideration shift across metro markets, you'd need roughly 8-12 reach points monthly with 3-4 frequency. That projects to approximately 25-35 million impressions annually.

At $1.575M budget, that's roughly $45-63 CPM blended - which is aggressive for broad reach but achievable if we focus spend on high-impact placements rather than pure volume.

This math suggests we'll need efficient channels like connected TV, digital video, and strategic OOH rather than broad display to hit your lift targets within budget.

Now for Segment 2 - In-Market Lead Gen. You have $2.025M (45% of $4.5M) targeting active shoppers. What's your target volume for VDP views, form fills, or test drive appointments?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent. Let me model this: $2.025M ÷ 5,000 test drives = $405 per appointment. That's slightly above your $400 target but within range.

At 30% close rate and $2,500 gross per unit, each test drive is worth $750 in revenue. Your $405 cost per appointment delivers 1.85x return - solid performance marketing efficiency.

To hit your preferred $250-$300 range, you'd need 20-40% better efficiency than the $405 baseline. In automotive, $250-$300 per test drive is achievable but requires tight audience targeting on high-intent shoppers actively browsing inventory.

Now for Segment 3 - Loyalty/Retention. You have $900K (20% of budget) targeting existing customers. What's your target volume for service appointments, trade-in inquiries, or lease renewals? And what's the typical value of these retention actions - service visit revenue or trade-in margin?

Turn 5:
Perfect targeting profile. 35-55, $85K-$150K HHI, driving 3-5 year old Honda/Toyota/Mazda - that's a defined upgrade audience with clear purchase intent signals.

The 50-mile dealership radius with broader digital reach is smart for awareness. You'll want tight geographic focus for high-impact placements like OOH and radio, but can extend digital targeting 75-100 miles to maximize efficient reach.

This audience likely represents 15-25% of your metro market - large enough for meaningful brand lift measurement but focused enough for efficient targeting.

Moving to Segment 2 - In-Market shoppers. You mentioned they're browsing Autotrader and Cars.com. Beyond active shopping behavior, what demographic profile are you targeting? Same age/income as conquest, or different segments actively shopping now?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Let me model Segment 3: $900K ÷ 8,500 total actions (8,000 service + 500 trade-ins) = $106 per action. That's just above your $100 target but very close.

Revenue potential: 8,000 service appointments × $350 = $2.8M, plus 500 trade-ins × $1,750 average = $875K. Total potential revenue of $3.675M against $900K spend delivers 4.1x return - excellent retention economics.

Your instinct is right - retention should be highly efficient given existing relationships and owned data. At $106 per action, you're in strong territory for CRM-driven campaigns.

**Summary across all three segments:**
- Conquest: $1.575M for brand lift (challenging but achievable CPMs)  
- In-Market: $2.025M for 5,000 test drives at $405 each (solid efficiency)
- Retention: $900K for 8,500 actions at $106 each (excellent efficiency)

Now let's define your audiences. Starting with Segment 1 - Conquest. Beyond "competitor vehicle owners," what demographic and behavioral signals define your awareness targets? Age ranges, income levels, vehicle types they currently drive?

Turn 6:
Excellent. 32-50, $95K-$175K HHI with high-intent behaviors - that's a premium audience with immediate purchase signals. The tighter 15-20 mile radius makes perfect sense for converting active shoppers.

This audience is smaller but more valuable - likely 3-8% of your metro markets but with much higher conversion probability. The higher income threshold ($95K vs $85K floor) aligns with your premium inventory positioning.

For Segment 3 - Loyalty/Retention, I assume you're targeting your existing customer database. What's the profile of your current customer base? Similar demographics to your conquest targets, or different mix across your 12 dealerships?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Perfect geographic context. DFW-Houston split at 65%-35% aligns with your 8-4 dealership distribution, but the luxury brand overperformance in Houston creates strategic opportunity.

Let me model the geographic allocation:
- DFW: $4.5M × 65% = $2.925M across 8 dealerships
- Houston: $4.5M × 35% = $1.575M across 4 dealerships

Houston's luxury overperformance suggests higher customer value per acquisition, which could justify premium targeting or channel investment there despite smaller footprint.

This creates an interesting strategic question: should we maintain the 65-35 split across all three segments, or should we weight Houston more heavily for conquest/in-market given the luxury performance, while keeping retention proportional to customer base?

What's your preference - maintain consistent geographic splits, or optimize by segment based on brand performance?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
That's a powerful retention foundation. 4.5-year average tenure with predictive trade cycle data gives you significant targeting precision that conquest and in-market segments lack.

The broader demographic spread (28-65, $65K-$225K) actually works in your favor for retention - you can micro-segment by brand, purchase history, and service patterns rather than relying on demographic proxies.

Now for geography. You mentioned 12 dealerships across 3 brands. What metro markets are you covering, and do you want to weight budget allocation by market size, or do some locations need more support than others?

Turn 10:
Excellent positioning. "Performance that moves you forward" captures both functional benefit and aspirational lifestyle progression - perfect for professionals ready to upgrade from reliable but uninspiring vehicles.

The technology and performance angle differentiates you from the practical reliability messaging of Honda/Toyota. Your conquest audience wants validation that they've earned an upgrade, and this positioning delivers that emotional payoff.

For Segment 2 - In-Market shoppers actively comparing options - what's your value proposition? These buyers are likely deeper in research, comparing specs, pricing, and dealer experience. What closes the deal when they're actively shopping?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Excellent strategic thinking. Dynamic allocation based on performance signals rather than just footprint distribution.

Let me model the optimized geographic splits:

**Conquest ($1.575M):** DFW $866K (55%), Houston $709K (45%)
**In-Market ($2.025M):** DFW $1.114M (55%), Houston $911K (45%) 
**Retention ($900K):** DFW $585K (65%), Houston $315K (35%)

This gives Houston 42% of total budget ($1.935M) despite having 33% of locations - a 27% overweight that should capitalize on luxury brand momentum while respecting your established customer base for retention.

Now let's establish your value propositions for each segment. Starting with conquest - what key messages will shift consideration from Honda/Toyota/Mazda toward your premium offerings? What differentiators matter most to that upgrade-minded audience?

Turn 11:
Perfect pivot. "Your perfect vehicle, your way - simplified" addresses the core friction points that active shoppers face. The transparent pricing and flexible purchase paths directly counter traditional dealership pain points.

This positioning is smart for high-intent audiences who've likely had negative experiences elsewhere. You're selling process innovation, not just product features.

For Segment 3 - Retention/Loyalty - what's your value proposition to existing customers? They already know your product quality, so what drives continued engagement and repeat business?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 12:
Perfect. "Your automotive relationship, intelligently managed" positions your CRM capabilities as competitive advantage while making customers feel valued rather than marketed to.

The proactive service approach transforms you from reactive vendor to trusted advisor - exactly what drives 4.5-year retention rates.

Now for channels. Given your three distinct value propositions and audience behaviors, let's start with Segment 1 - Conquest awareness. You need broad metro reach for brand lift with $1.575M budget. What channels are you considering for reaching upgrade-minded professionals effectively?
