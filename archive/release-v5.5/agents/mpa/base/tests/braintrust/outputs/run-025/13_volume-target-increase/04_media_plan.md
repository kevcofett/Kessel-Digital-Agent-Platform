# Media Plan Output: Volume Target Increase

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've given me great starting data - $400K budget, 5,000 customers, $320 LTV for home goods. Let me quickly check the math: $400K ÷ 5,000 = $80 per customer acquisition cost. At $320 LTV, that's a 4:1 ratio, which is solid for home goods.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 5,000 new customers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect! Growing your customer base with repeat buyers is a strong foundation. Let me clarify your primary success metric - when you say you want 5,000 new customers who become repeat buyers, how will you measure success as a specific number?

For example, are you measuring:
- Total new customers acquired (5,000)
- Revenue generated from these customers
- Repeat purchase rate within a certain timeframe
- Something else?

I want to make sure we're tracking the right metric to prove this campaign worked.

Turn 3:
Excellent - 5,000 new customers with 30% repeat rate within six months. That means 1,500 customers making second purchases, which is a strong retention target for home goods.

Your $80 acquisition cost against $320 LTV looks solid, but let me check if that efficiency is realistic. Based on industry benchmarks, home goods typically sees $60-100 acquisition costs, so your $80 target sits right in the sweet spot - achievable but not overly conservative.

One quick economics question: Do you know your typical profit margin on first purchases? This helps us understand how much cushion you have if acquisition costs run slightly higher than $80.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Perfect! At 42% margin, you have healthy unit economics. If average first purchase is around $200, that's $84 gross profit per customer, which more than covers your $80 acquisition target.

With $320 LTV and targeting 30% repeat rate, your economics look strong - you're well-positioned to hit aggressive efficiency targets if needed.

Your Step 1 Outcomes and Step 2 Economics are solid. Now let's define your target audience. 

Who is your ideal customer for home goods? Start with the basics - demographics like age, income, homeownership status, or any key characteristics that define your best buyers.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Great foundation! Homeowners 30-55, $85-150K income, investing in personalized modern spaces. That's a solid demographic base.

Now let's add behavioral depth - what specific behaviors or interests help you identify your best customers? For example:

- Do they follow home design influencers or brands?
- Shop at specific retailers like West Elm, CB2, or Target's home section?
- Engage with home renovation content?
- Have recent life events like moving or renovating?

These behavioral signals help us find more people like your current best customers.

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 6:
Perfect! So we have homeowners 30-55, $85-150K income, following design influencers, active on Instagram/Pinterest/Houzz, interested in modern minimalist styles, and often triggered by life events like marriage or home purchase.

That gives us strong targeting signals across multiple platforms. 

Now for geography - are you targeting nationally, or do you have specific regions, states, or metro areas you want to focus on? Also, do you see any geographic patterns in your current best customers?

Turn 7:
Excellent! National reach with concentration in design-conscious metros makes sense. CA, TX, NY, IL, FL metros like SF, Austin, Chicago, NYC are your sweet spots.

Now for budget allocation. You have $400K total - how do you want to think about splitting this? For example:

- Geographic allocation (more budget to high-performing metros vs. national reach)
- Acquisition vs. retention budget split
- Or do you want to start with an even national approach and optimize based on performance?

Given your strong metro performance, we could weight budget toward those markets while maintaining national presence.

Turn 8:
Let me update our projections. $400K ÷ 8,000 = $50 per customer. That's 37.5% more efficient than our original $80 target.

At $50 vs. benchmark $60-100, you're targeting 17-50% below typical home goods acquisition costs. This is aggressive and requires excellent execution.

The challenge: your $84 first-purchase gross profit still covers the $50 CAC, but you have much less margin for error. To hit $50 efficiently, you'd need:
- Tighter audience targeting to higher-intent segments
- Strong creative performance from day one
- Optimal channel mix focused on your best-performing metros

Alternative: increase budget to ~$640K to maintain your proven $80 efficiency while hitting 8,000 customers.

Which direction feels more realistic - pushing efficiency or increasing budget?

Turn 9:
Smart recalibration! 6,000 customers at $65-70 CAC shows strong growth while maintaining quality. Let me run those numbers:

At $67 average: $400K ÷ 6,000 = $67 per customer. That's 16% better than your original $80 but stays within realistic bounds for home goods. Your $84 gross profit still provides healthy cushion.

This targets 20% growth over your original 5,000 while keeping acquisition costs achievable. Much more defensible to leadership than promising impossible efficiency gains.

Now let's get back to budget allocation. With 6,000 customers and your strong metro performance, how do you want to weight your $400K geographically? 

Should we allocate more heavily to your proven markets like SF, Austin, Chicago, NYC, or maintain broader national coverage?

Turn 10:
Perfect! 70/30 split maximizes your proven markets while maintaining national reach. That's $280K for top metros, $120K for broader national.

Now let's develop your value proposition. You mentioned customers invest in "personalized modern spaces" rather than just buying furniture. 

What's your core message that differentiates HomeStyle Direct from competitors like West Elm or CB2? What makes someone choose you over other home goods retailers?
