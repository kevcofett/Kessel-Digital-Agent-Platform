# Media Plan Output: Demographic Shift Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I am excited to build a media plan with you. We will cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by recalculating your efficiency target: $1.5M ÷ 100K customers = $15 per customer acquisition cost. For streetwear, that's extremely aggressive - typical CAC runs $25-50 based on Knowledge Base benchmarks. At $15 vs $350 LTV, you're targeting a 23:1 ratio, which is outstanding if achievable.

To hit this ambitious target, we'll need surgical precision on audience and channels. What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 100K new customers - is it revenue growth, market expansion, or something else?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect - revenue growth and brand expansion with market share gains. That's a clear business objective.

Now let's define success measurement. With 100K customers at $350 LTV, you're targeting $35M in customer lifetime value. But for tracking campaign performance, what's your primary success metric? 

Are you measuring success by:
- New customer acquisitions (the 100K target)
- Revenue generated from new customers
- Market share percentage in target DMAs
- Something else?

I need to know what number you'll be watching daily to determine if the campaign is working.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Excellent - 100K new customer acquisitions is your primary KPI. That gives us a clear success definition.

Your $15 CAC target is ambitious but makes sense for a volume-focused growth strategy. At $15 vs typical $25-50 for streetwear, you're targeting 40-70% better efficiency than market norms. This is achievable with tight audience definition and high-performing creative, but will require disciplined execution.

Now for Step 2 economics validation: At $350 LTV and targeting $15 CAC, your LTV:CAC ratio would be 23:1, which is exceptionally strong. What's your typical contribution margin on first purchase? This helps me assess if the $15 CAC leaves enough room for profitable growth while you wait for the full LTV to materialize.

Turn 4:
Got it. At 40-45% margin and $15 CAC, you're essentially breaking even or slightly positive on first purchase, then banking on repeat purchases for the $350 LTV payoff. That's a classic growth-stage strategy - aggressive acquisition with lifetime value as the profit engine.

This confirms your $15 CAC target is feasible from a unit economics perspective, though it requires hitting that efficiency benchmark consistently. The math works if execution delivers.

Your economics foundation is solid. Now let's move to Step 3 - Audience definition. You mentioned Millennials 25-40 interested in streetwear and urban fashion. To hit your aggressive $15 CAC, we need surgical targeting precision.

What specific behavioral signals identify your best customers beyond age and interest in streetwear?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Perfect - that lifestyle-based targeting is exactly what we need for $15 CAC efficiency. Sneaker culture, streetwear influencer followers, urban music/art scenes, and brand affinity for Supreme/Off-White gives us strong behavioral signals beyond demographics.

To sharpen this further: within this audience, do you see patterns around income levels, employment types, or urban vs suburban residence? And are there specific music genres, artist followings, or cultural events that correlate with your highest-value customers?

The tighter we can define this audience, the better our chances of hitting that aggressive efficiency target.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 6:
Excellent targeting intel. Creative professionals earning $75-125K in major urban centers, connected to Tyler, the Creator/Frank Ocean music scenes, digital-native on Instagram/TikTok, and valuing authenticity. This precision targeting is exactly what your $15 CAC needs.

Your audience definition is strong for Step 3. Now for Step 4 - Geography refinement. You mentioned top 25 DMAs, but with this specific audience profile, some metros will be much more efficient than others.

Given your creative professional target in urban centers, are you planning equal investment across all 25 DMAs, or do you want to weight toward markets like NYC, LA, Chicago where this audience concentrates most heavily?

Turn 7:
Perfect - 60-70% budget concentration in NYC, LA, Chicago, SF, Atlanta, Miami makes complete sense for your creative professional audience. Those markets have the density and culture alignment you need for efficient acquisition.

Your geographic strategy is solid for Step 4. Moving to Step 5 - Budget allocation. With $1.5M total and 60-70% weighted to top metros, that's roughly $900K-$1M for your primary markets and $500K-$600K for secondary DMAs.

At your $15 CAC target, the primary markets would need to deliver 60K-67K customers, leaving 33K-40K from secondary markets. Does this allocation feel realistic given what you know about audience density in these different tiers of cities?

Turn 8:
Let me recalculate immediately. Gen Z (18-27) changes several key assumptions:

**Economic Impact**: Gen Z typically has lower disposable income than your original 25-40 target. If they're earning $35-65K vs $75-125K, your $15 CAC becomes even more aggressive - potentially requiring 50-60% better efficiency than typical Gen Z acquisition costs.

**LTV Risk**: Your $350 LTV assumption may need validation. Gen Z often has lower initial spend but higher lifetime engagement. We should verify if $350 LTV holds for 18-27 year-olds.

**Channel Implications**: Gen Z is heavily TikTok-native vs Instagram-primary, which could actually help efficiency if competition is lower on TikTok.

Before we redesign the plan - what does your research show about Gen Z purchase behavior and spending patterns compared to your original Millennial target?

Turn 9:
Let me update the economics based on this data. Lower transaction value ($75-100 vs $150-200) but higher frequency and loyalty changes the LTV calculation significantly.

If Gen Z averages $85 per purchase vs Millennial $175, you'd need roughly 4+ purchases to hit that $350 LTV vs 2 purchases for Millennials. The good news: higher frequency and loyalty supports this, but it extends the payback period.

**Critical question**: Do you want to stick with the $350 LTV target, or should we model a more conservative Gen Z LTV based on their actual spending patterns? This directly impacts whether $15 CAC is realistic or if we need to adjust either the efficiency target or volume goal.

What LTV are you confident Gen Z will deliver over 12-18 months?

Turn 10:
Perfect adjustment. At $250-275 LTV, let's recalculate your efficiency targets:

**New Economics**: $250 LTV ÷ $15 CAC = 16.7:1 ratio (still strong)
$275 LTV ÷ $15 CAC = 18.3:1 ratio (excellent)

However, with Gen Z's lower disposable income and competitive streetwear market, $15 CAC may still be aggressive. Industry benchmarks for Gen Z acquisition typically run $20-35.

**Budget Reality Check**: At $15 CAC × 100K customers = $1.5M (your full budget goes to acquisition with zero for creative, overhead, or testing).

Should we model a more realistic $18-22 CAC, which would give you budget flexibility while maintaining strong unit economics? Or do you want to reduce the volume target to preserve the $15 efficiency goal?
