# Media Plan Output: Channel Mix Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You mentioned awareness goals - what specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with this launch? Are you looking to drive trial purchases, build brand recognition for future sales, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect - trial purchases and market share building through actual product pickup. That's a clear conversion objective.

How will you measure success? What specific number tells you the campaign worked - is it trial purchase volume, number of new customers acquired, or revenue from the new product line?

Turn 3:
Excellent - 150,000 trial households in Q1 is your primary KPI. Let me calculate your implied efficiency: $3M ÷ 150,000 = $20 per trial household.

For organic/natural food trial acquisition, benchmarks typically run $25-45 per household based on category data. Your $20 target is aggressive - about 20-40% more efficient than typical. This is achievable but requires precise targeting and strong channel efficiency.

To validate this is realistic: what's the average trial purchase value, and do you know your target customer lifetime value or repeat purchase rate?

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using reasonable assumptions based on category benchmarks, and you can refine anytime.

Let me work with: $12 average trial value (2.4 units at $4.99), 45% repeat rate, and typical organic snack margins of 35%. This suggests trial customers could be worth $35-50 over time, making your $20 acquisition target feasible if execution is strong.

Your $20 target requires efficient targeting and channel mix. The math works if we can identify your highest-intent audiences precisely.

Now let's define exactly who these health-conscious families are. Beyond the broad description, what age range and income level best describes your target households?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 5:
Perfect - families 25-54, $75K+ household income, actively seeking organic alternatives. That's a solid foundation.

To sharpen this further: what specific behaviors or attitudes distinguish your ideal customers from other health-conscious families? For example, do they already shop at Whole Foods, read nutrition labels religiously, follow specific diets, or have particular concerns like avoiding artificial ingredients?

Turn 6:
Excellent - proactive nutrition advocates with holistic health philosophy. That's precise targeting.

Now for geography: you mentioned "nationally" but with a $20 per household target, we need strategic focus. Are there specific regions, metro areas, or market types where your retail distribution is strongest, or where health-conscious families are most concentrated?

Turn 7:
Smart geographic focus - West Coast, Denver, Seattle, and Northeast metros with strong natural grocery distribution. That alignment between media spend and retail availability will maximize trial conversion.

Let me assess your targeting precision against your $20 efficiency goal. You're targeting proactive nutrition advocates, 25-54, $75K+, in premium natural grocery markets. This represents roughly 8-12% of households in your target DMAs - tight enough for your aggressive efficiency target.

Now for budget allocation: how do you want to split your $3M across these regions? Should we weight by population, retail distribution strength, or health-conscious household concentration?

Turn 8:
That's a significant constraint that impacts your $20 per household target. Meta and TikTok typically offer the most cost-efficient household targeting for health-conscious audiences - often 30-40% more efficient than other channels.

Without social platforms, we're looking at Google, Connected TV, programmatic display, and potentially traditional channels like radio or OOH. These typically run $30-50 per household for your audience profile, making your $20 target very challenging.

We have two paths: adjust the target to $30-35 per household (reducing reach to ~100K households), or increase budget to $4-4.5M to maintain 150K households. Which direction makes more sense for your launch goals?

Turn 9:
I appreciate the ambition, but we need to address the math directly. At $3M budget targeting 150K households without Meta/TikTok, you're asking for $20 per household when available channels typically deliver $30-50 for this audience.

Even with hyper-targeted programmatic and niche health platforms (like wellness podcasts, nutrition apps, or health-focused Connected TV), you'd need 40-60% better efficiency than market benchmarks. That's extremely aggressive.

The most realistic path forward: can you secure additional retail marketing co-op dollars from Whole Foods, Sprouts, or other partners? Their in-store and owned media could bridge the efficiency gap we need.

Turn 10:
Excellent - that $500K co-op brings us to $3.5M total, improving to $23 per household. Still aggressive but much more achievable.

For niche health platforms with precision targeting:

**Connected TV**: Health/wellness content on platforms like Hulu, Roku (cooking shows, wellness documentaries) - can target your exact demographics in your focus DMAs

**Audio**: Health/wellness podcasts through Spotify Ad Studio, plus targeted radio in your key markets during morning drive (when meal-planning happens)

**Programmatic**: Health-focused websites, recipe platforms, and wellness apps with first-party data on organic/clean eating behaviors

**Google ecosystem**: YouTube health channels, Search for organic snack terms, Shopping ads when people research products

The key is layering behavioral signals across these channels to recreate social media's precision. Which of these resonates most with where your customers actually consume content?

Turn 11:
Perfect - YouTube and podcasts align well with your research-oriented customers.

For **YouTube precision**: Layer health/wellness channel viewers + organic food searchers + your demographic/income filters + geographic focus. We can target specific channels like "Clean Food Dirty Girl" or nutrition educators, plus retarget people who've searched organic snack terms. This creates 15-20 targeting signals for precision.

For **podcasts**: Target wellness shows like "The Model Health Show" or parenting-focused nutrition content, layered with Spotify's behavioral data on users who engage with clean eating content. Morning show placements hit meal-planning mindset.

Both channels offer lookalike targeting from your existing customer emails if available.

Before we finalize channel strategy, I need to understand your value proposition better. What specific message will convert these health-conscious families from awareness to trial? What makes your organic snacks different from the dozen other options on Whole Foods shelves?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 12:
"Nutrition Simplified" with kid-approved taste is compelling - it addresses the parent struggle of finding healthy snacks kids will actually eat.

For your YouTube and podcast strategy, this positions perfectly around content moments when parents are researching solutions to feeding challenges. We can target around "healthy snacks for kids" searches and parenting nutrition discussions.

Now let's structure your channel allocation. With $3.5M total budget, I recommend:
- 35% YouTube ($1.2M) - research behavior targeting
- 25% Podcasts ($875K) - morning routine placement  
- 25% Connected TV ($875K) - evening family viewing
- 15% Google Search/Shopping ($550K) - capture intent

This mix targets your audience across their content journey. Does this allocation feel right for reaching those 150K trial households, or should we adjust the weighting between channels?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 13:
Absolutely - that optimization flexibility is crucial for hitting your aggressive $23 per household target. Standard practice is holding 10-15% in reserve for reallocation based on performance data.

Here's the revised structure:
- Launch allocation: 85% of budget ($3M) across channels as discussed
- Optimization reserve: 15% ($500K) for month 2+ reallocation
- Weekly performance reviews to identify top performers

After 4 weeks, we'll have enough trial conversion data to shift budget toward your most efficient channels. This approach maximizes learning while protecting your 150K household goal.

For measurement: how will you track which households actually trial your product? Do you have retail scan data, coupon tracking, or another method to connect media exposure to in-store purchases?

Turn 14:
Excellent measurement setup - Nielsen scan data plus QR code tracking creates the closed-loop attribution you need. The digital coupon bridge from exposure to purchase is smart for connecting media to retail outcomes.

For testing strategy: with your aggressive efficiency target and no social platforms, we need rapid optimization. I recommend launching with 3-4 creative variations of "Nutrition Simplified" across your channels - test different parent pain points (picky eaters vs. busy schedules vs. ingredient concerns) to see what drives highest QR code engagement and coupon redemption.

Also test audience segments: compare performance between strict organic-only households versus broader health-conscious families to optimize your targeting precision.

Finally, what risks concern you most about this plan? The channel constraints, the aggressive efficiency target, or something else we should plan contingencies for?

Turn 15:
Your risk assessment is spot-on. Here's a contingency framework:

**Early Warning System**: If week 2 data shows >$30 per household, immediately activate backup channels - health-focused Connected TV networks, wellness newsletter sponsorships, or targeted radio during school pickup hours.

**Budget Escalation Plan**: Prepare leadership case for additional $500K-1M if month 1 tracking shows we're 20%+ off pace. Frame as "investment protection" - better to hit 150K households at $27 cost than miss at $23.

**Creative Pivot Protocol**: If QR engagement is <2%, rapidly test more direct messaging like "Finally, healthy snacks your kids will ask for" - less brand-focused, more problem-solution.

**Retail Amplification**: Lean harder into your Whole Foods/Sprouts partnerships for in-store sampling and shelf placement if digital efficiency lags.

You've built a solid plan with smart measurement. The constraints are real, but your targeting precision and retail alignment give you the best shot at hitting 150K households. Ready to move forward?

Turn 16:
Perfect - you've built a strong plan with realistic contingencies. Your daily tracking approach and pre-aligned leadership expectations set you up for success.

Key execution priorities:
- Launch with tight targeting precision on YouTube/podcasts
- Monitor QR engagement rates from day one
- Activate retail partnerships early for maximum trial conversion
- Keep that 15% optimization reserve ready for rapid reallocation

Your "Nutrition Simplified" message, closed-loop measurement, and retail alignment give you the best possible shot at 150K households despite the channel constraints. The aggressive efficiency target is challenging but achievable with disciplined execution.

Good luck with the launch - this plan balances ambition with smart risk management. You're ready to execute.
