# Media Plan Output: Audience Addition Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I am excited to build a media plan with you. We will cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your business outcome. You mentioned generating 5,000 qualified leads - what happens after that? Are you measuring success by leads converted to clients, total revenue, or something else?

Also, what's your typical lead-to-client conversion rate so I can model the full funnel?

Turn 2:
Perfect. Let me model this: 5,000 leads converting at 5-6% = 250-300 clients generating $375-450M AUM. With $15K LTV per client, that's $3.75-4.5M in lifetime value from a $2M investment - strong 1.9-2.3x return.

Your efficiency target: $2M ÷ 5,000 leads = $400 per qualified lead. 

For wealth management, qualified leads typically run $300-800 depending on asset thresholds and geography. At $400 per lead targeting $1M+ investable assets, you're in the efficient range - not aggressive, not conservative.

This looks realistic. Your primary KPI is qualified leads, and the volume target is 5,000. Step 1 complete.

Now for economics - what defines a "qualified lead" for you? Verified asset level, age criteria, or expressed interest in wealth management?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent. Those qualification criteria are tight - age 55+, $1M+ assets, AND active engagement through consultation requests. This creates a high-intent funnel.

At $400 per qualified lead with those criteria, you're targeting strong efficiency. Most wealth management firms see $500-900 for leads with verified assets and demonstrated intent. Your $400 target is achievable but requires precise targeting.

Let me validate the math: 5,000 qualified leads × 5.5% conversion = 275 clients × $15K LTV = $4.125M lifetime value against $2M investment. That's a solid 2.1x return.

Your economics look sound - realistic efficiency target with strong ROI potential.

Now let's define your audience precisely. Within that 55+ demographic with $1M+ assets, are there specific wealth accumulation patterns or life events that trigger wealth management needs? For example, recent retirees, business owners approaching exit, or inheritance recipients?

Turn 4:
Perfect targeting insight. Recent retirees from professional backgrounds are ideal - they have concentrated wealth accumulation events and immediate need for income transition strategies.

This audience refinement actually strengthens your $400 per lead efficiency. Professional retirees with wealth transition needs convert at higher rates than general HNW prospects, often 7-9% versus your conservative 5-6% model.

For wealth management targeting professionals in retirement transition, you're looking at roughly 2-3% of the total HNW population in major markets. In top 30 wealth markets, that's approximately 400K-600K individuals matching your profile.

This audience size supports your 5,000 lead target without saturation concerns.

What specific professional backgrounds convert best for you - C-suite executives, business owners who've sold, medical professionals, or other categories? This will help us layer targeting signals effectively.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Excellent segmentation. C-suite executives and business owners post-exit have immediate wealth transition needs and understand sophisticated planning - they're your highest-intent prospects. Medical professionals provide strong secondary volume with consistent conversion patterns.

This creates clear targeting layers:
- Primary: Recent C-suite/business sale professionals 55+ with $1M+ assets
- Secondary: Senior medical professionals approaching/in retirement with similar asset thresholds

With these specific professional backgrounds, your $400 per qualified lead becomes even more realistic. These audiences actively seek wealth management and have higher engagement rates than general HNW targeting.

Your audience definition is complete. Now let's establish geography precisely.

You mentioned the top 30 wealth markets. Are you thinking major metros like NYC, SF, LA, plus wealth corridors like Greenwich, Scottsdale, and Naples? Or do you have a specific DMA list you've validated against your current client concentration?

Turn 6:
Perfect. Let me structure your geography targeting around those validated markets. You have 9 primary metros plus 4 wealth corridors - that's strategic concentration in proven markets.

Here's your geography framework:

| Geography Name | Total Population | Target Audience Size | Target Audience % |
|----------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| New York DMA | 7,450,000 | 22,350 | 0.30% |
| Los Angeles DMA | 5,200,000 | 15,600 | 0.30% |
| Chicago DMA | 3,470,000 | 10,410 | 0.30% |
| San Francisco DMA | 2,650,000 | 10,600 | 0.40% |
| Boston DMA | 2,380,000 | 9,520 | 0.40% |
| Washington DC DMA | 2,330,000 | 9,320 | 0.40% |
| Dallas DMA | 2,800,000 | 8,400 | 0.30% |
| Houston DMA | 2,650,000 | 7,950 | 0.30% |
| Miami DMA | 1,740,000 | 6,960 | 0.40% |
| Seattle DMA | 1,940,000 | 5,820 | 0.30% |
| **TOTAL** | **32,610,000** | **106,930** | **0.33%** |

Your target audience of 107K professionals across these markets easily supports 5,000 qualified leads - you're targeting about 5% market penetration, which is conservative and achievable.

Should we add the wealth corridors as separate line items, or are they captured within their parent DMAs?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Perfect. Your geographic framework is complete - 10 primary DMAs with 107K target professionals supporting your 5,000 lead goal at conservative 5% market penetration.

Now let's structure your $2M budget allocation. 

Looking at your geography and audience concentration, I'd recommend this framework:
- 70% ($1.4M) for acquisition across your 10 DMAs
- 20% ($400K) for nurturing and conversion optimization 
- 10% ($200K) flexibility reserve for performance shifts

For geographic allocation, weight by audience concentration:
- Tier 1 (NY, SF, Boston, DC, Miami): 60% of acquisition budget
- Tier 2 (LA, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Seattle): 40% of acquisition budget

This puts roughly $840K against your highest-converting markets and $560K against volume markets.

Does this allocation align with your market priorities, or should we adjust the geographic weighting?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
This significantly changes our plan. We now have two distinct audiences with different objectives, economics, and channel needs. Let me reframe this properly.

You're targeting two separate segments:
1. **Primary**: 55+ retirees, $1M+ assets, wealth preservation (your original plan)
2. **New**: 30-45 professionals, $250K-$1M assets, wealth building

These require different strategies. The 30-45 segment will have:
- Different LTV (likely lower than $15K)
- Different conversion rates
- Different qualification criteria
- Different channel preferences
- Different messaging

Before I can model this effectively, I need to understand: Are you looking for one integrated plan serving both audiences, or should we build separate strategies? 

Also, what's the target volume split between segments, and do you have LTV data for the younger demographic?

This is a much more complex planning challenge than our original retirement-focused approach.

Turn 11:
Brilliant strategic thinking. You're building a future client pipeline, not just generating immediate conversions. That 30-35% nurturing allocation for emerging affluent is spot-on for long-term relationship building.

Let me remodel your budget with this nurturing-heavy approach:

**RETIREMENT SEGMENT (5,000 leads)**
- Acquisition: $1M (80% of segment budget)
- Conversion optimization: $250K (20%)
- Efficiency: $200 per lead

**EMERGING AFFLUENT (3,000 leads)**
- Acquisition: $525K (70% of segment budget) 
- Digital nurturing ecosystem: $225K (30%)
- Efficiency: $175 per lead + sustained engagement investment

This creates much more realistic efficiency targets and acknowledges the different business models. Your emerging affluent strategy becomes a content-driven relationship platform rather than direct response lead generation.

The dedicated digital ecosystem concept is smart - it positions you as their wealth advisor before they need wealth management.

Your budget framework is now aligned with segment realities. Ready to move to value proposition development for each audience?

Turn 12:
Perfect value proposition framework. You've identified the core motivations for each segment.

**RETIREMENT SEGMENT VALUE PROPOSITION:**
- Primary promise: "Preserve and optimize your wealth for a secure retirement income"
- Key pillars: Wealth preservation, tax optimization, income stability
- Pain points addressed: Market volatility concerns, tax inefficiency, income uncertainty

**EMERGING AFFLUENT VALUE PROPOSITION:**
- Primary promise: "Build a comprehensive financial foundation for long-term wealth growth"
- Key pillars: Growth strategies, investment education, financial planning foundation
- Pain points addressed: Investment complexity, financial planning overwhelm, wealth-building guidance

These create distinct messaging tracks:
- Retirement: Security, preservation, optimization (defensive positioning)
- Emerging Affluent: Growth, education, foundation-building (offensive positioning)

Your value propositions align perfectly with the different nurturing strategies - retirement focuses on immediate expertise, emerging affluent on educational partnership.

Now we're ready for channel strategy. With two audiences, different qualification thresholds, and distinct value propositions, we'll need channels that can deliver both immediate conversions and long-term relationship building.

What channels are you currently using, and which have worked best for each segment?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Got it. You now have 8,000 total leads across two distinct segments with different economics and lifecycle stages. Let me remodel this:

**SEGMENT 1 - RETIREMENT TRANSITION (Original)**
- 5,000 qualified leads
- $1M+ assets, 55+, wealth preservation focus
- $15K LTV, 5-6% conversion rate

**SEGMENT 2 - EMERGING AFFLUENT (New)**
- 3,000 qualified leads  
- $250K-$1M assets, 30-45, wealth building focus
- $7-10K LTV (let's model at $8.5K), conversion rate TBD

This creates two efficiency targets from your $2M budget:
- If we allocate proportionally: $1.25M for 5,000 retirement leads = $250 per lead
- $750K for 3,000 emerging affluent = $250 per lead

But these segments have very different qualification criteria and channel costs. 

What defines a "qualified lead" for the 30-45 segment? Same consultation request standard, or different engagement threshold given their earlier wealth-building stage?

Turn 10:
Excellent distinction. Lower qualification bar for emerging affluent makes sense - they're in learning mode, not immediate decision mode.

This creates very different efficiency expectations:

**RETIREMENT SEGMENT**: $250 per consultation-request lead (high intent)
**EMERGING AFFLUENT**: $250 per digitally-engaged lead (educational intent)

The emerging affluent target is actually aggressive. Digital engagement leads in wealth management typically run $150-400, but at $250 you're targeting the higher end for a lower-intent qualification.

More importantly, these segments need different conversion funnels:
- Retirement: Lead → Consultation → Client (weeks)
- Emerging Affluent: Lead → Education → Nurturing → Client (months/years)

Your $8.5K LTV assumption for emerging affluent may be conservative if you're building long-term relationships. These clients could grow into your $15K+ segment over time.

Should we allocate budget differently given these conversion timeline differences? The emerging affluent segment might need more nurturing budget relative to acquisition.

Turn 14:
Excellent insight. Content development is critical for execution success, especially the interactive tools and webinars for emerging affluent engagement.

For measurement, I recommend this framework:

**RETIREMENT SEGMENT METRICS:**
- Primary: Qualified leads (consultation requests) at $200 efficiency
- Secondary: Consultation-to-client conversion rate (target 5-6%)
- Tertiary: Speed to conversion, average AUM per new client

**EMERGING AFFLUENT METRICS:**
- Primary: Digital engagement leads at $175 efficiency  
- Secondary: Nurturing engagement (webinar attendance, tool usage, content downloads)
- Tertiary: Lead scoring progression, long-term conversion tracking

**CROSS-SEGMENT MEASUREMENT:**
- Attribution modeling across touchpoints
- Content performance by audience segment
- Channel efficiency by qualification type

The interactive tools and webinars become measurable engagement assets - track usage depth, return visits, and progression through your educational journey.

Given your content development needs, should we discuss testing priorities to validate content performance before full-scale investment? Starting with smaller pilots could help optimize your educational content approach while building measurement baselines.

Turn 15:
Perfect testing approach. A 500-lead pilot for emerging affluent validates content strategy before full investment. Your three webinar topics - diversification, tax-efficient building, career-stage planning - directly address wealth-building pain points.

**PILOT STRUCTURE:**
- Budget: ~$87K (500 leads × $175 = acquisition cost)
- Content test: 3 webinar topics with engagement tracking
- Duration: 8-10 weeks to capture full nurturing cycle
- Success metrics: Engagement depth, progression scoring, early conversion signals

This pilot de-risks your $225K nurturing investment and provides content performance data for scaling.

**KEY RISKS TO MONITOR:**

**EXECUTION RISKS:**
- Content development timeline vs. campaign launch
- Marketing operations tracking complexity
- Channel coordination across two distinct audiences

**MARKET RISKS:**
- Economic shifts affecting HNW prospect behavior
- Competitive response in wealth management space
- Platform algorithm changes impacting targeting precision

**PERFORMANCE RISKS:**
- Lower conversion rates if qualification criteria prove too broad
- Audience fatigue in concentrated geographic markets
- Attribution challenges across long nurturing cycles

Your pilot approach mitigates the biggest execution risk. Ready to finalize the complete strategy, or should we address any specific risk concerns?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 13:
Your current approach confirms the need for precision targeting. Financial publications work for retirement segment but lack the digital nurturing capability for emerging affluent. Let me recommend an integrated channel strategy:

**RETIREMENT SEGMENT CHANNELS (5,000 leads at $200 each):**
- Premium financial publications (WSJ, FT): 40% ($400K) - proven audience match
- LinkedIn targeted advertising: 35% ($350K) - professional targeting precision
- Wealth management publications: 25% ($250K) - high-intent readership

**EMERGING AFFLUENT CHANNELS (3,000 leads at $175 each + nurturing):**
- LinkedIn advertising: 45% ($236K) - professional targeting at scale
- Financial podcast sponsorships: 30% ($158K) - educational content alignment
- Digital content ecosystem: 25% ($131K) - owned media for nurturing

**CROSS-SEGMENT NURTURING ($225K):**
- Marketing automation platform
- Educational webinar series
- Interactive financial tools
- Retargeting campaigns

This creates audience-specific acquisition with shared nurturing infrastructure. LinkedIn becomes your primary precision targeting tool across both segments with different messaging.

Does this channel allocation align with your targeting capabilities and content resources?
