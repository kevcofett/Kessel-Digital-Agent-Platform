USER:
Hey, I'm the growth lead at QuickSend. We're a remittance fintech looking to acquire 10,000 new users this quarter with a $500K media spend. Let's build out the media strategy.

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've given me a great starting point - 10,000 new users with $500K spend. Let me calculate what this means:

$500K ÷ 10,000 users = $50 cost per customer

For fintech user acquisition, this is aggressive. Typical runs $75-150 based on industry benchmarks due to trust barriers and regulatory complexity.

To clarify your business outcome: Are you focused purely on user acquisition volume, or do you need these users to reach a specific activity level (like first transaction, account funding, or transaction volume)?

TURN 2 (Step 3)

USER:
We're targeting users who complete their first transaction. Just getting signups isn't enough - we need funded, active accounts. The $50 acquisition cost feels tight, but we're confident in our product's value proposition for international money transfers. I'd love to understand how we can optimize for quality users who will actually use our platform.

AGENT:
Perfect - that's a much stronger success metric. Active users who complete transactions have real value versus empty signups.

Let me update the math: $500K ÷ 10,000 transacting users = $50 per activated user.

For fintech with transaction completion requirements, $50 is very aggressive. Typical activated user costs run $100-200+ due to the conversion funnel from signup to first transaction.

To assess if $50 is achievable, what's the typical value you see from a user who completes their first transaction? This could be average transaction revenue, first-year customer value, or however you measure user worth.
