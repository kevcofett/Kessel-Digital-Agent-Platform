# Media Plan Output: Basic User - Steps 1-2 Completion

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What business outcome are you trying to achieve? For example, are you looking to get more customers, increase sales from existing customers, or build brand awareness?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Getting new customers to buy shoes online is a clear objective. 

To measure success, what specific number would tell you this is working? For example, are you focused on total number of new customers, total sales dollars, or something else?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Great! So we're targeting 500 new customers in three months. That gives us a clear goal to work toward.

Now I need to understand if this target is realistic for your budget. What's a typical customer worth to your business - meaning how much revenue do you usually get from someone who buys shoes from you?
