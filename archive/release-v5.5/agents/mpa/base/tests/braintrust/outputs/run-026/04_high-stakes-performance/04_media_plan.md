# Media Plan Output: High-Stakes Performance Campaign

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've given me great detail upfront. Let me start by modeling what you've shared:

**Your Math:**
$2M budget ÷ 50,000 merchants = $40 cost per merchant
$850 LTV ÷ $40 CAC = 21.25x return

That's extremely efficient for fintech - industry benchmarks typically run $150-400 CAC for merchant acquisition. At $40, you're targeting 75-85% below market rates.

To clarify your primary objective: Are you focused on pure merchant volume (50,000 new sign-ups), or is there a revenue/GMV target that drives this merchant count?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect - that quality filter is crucial. You're targeting merchants with $10K+ monthly processing, which means higher-value acquisition.

Let me update the math with your quality threshold:

**Refined Economics:**
- Target: 50,000 qualified merchants ($10K+ monthly processing)
- Budget: $2M = $40 per qualified merchant
- LTV: $850 per merchant
- Efficiency: 21.25x return

The $40 CAC becomes even more aggressive when we factor in the quality filter. Typical fintech sees 30-50% of sign-ups meet processing thresholds, so you're essentially targeting $40 for merchants others might spend $200-600 to acquire.

For Step 2 Economics: Do you have data on what percentage of your current merchant sign-ups actually hit that $10K monthly processing threshold? This will help us model realistic conversion rates from leads to qualified merchants.

Turn 3:
Got it. I'll model using 37.5% conversion rate based on your range. You can refine anytime.

**Economics Reality Check:**
- 50,000 qualified merchants at 37.5% conversion = 133,333 total sign-ups needed
- $2M ÷ 133,333 = $15 cost per sign-up
- Industry benchmarks for fintech lead generation: $25-75 per qualified lead

At $15 per sign-up, you're targeting 40-80% below typical rates. This is highly aggressive and requires exceptional targeting precision.

**Two paths forward:**
1. Tighter targeting to hit $15 efficiency (very challenging)
2. Budget increase to ~$3.3M for market-rate acquisition

Your instinct about "more targeted acquisition" is exactly right - hitting this efficiency demands surgical precision on merchant profiles.

Moving to Step 3: What defines your ideal merchant beyond the $10K processing threshold? Industry vertical, business size, current payment setup?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Perfect - that's actionable intelligence. Home services at 45% higher conversion changes our math significantly.

**Refined Targeting Strategy:**
- Primary: Home services (contractors, landscaping, home repair)
- Secondary: Other service businesses
- This conversion lift helps justify your aggressive $15 cost per sign-up

For Step 4 Geography: Are you seeing regional patterns in home services adoption? For example, do certain markets have higher concentrations of your ideal merchants, or different competitive landscapes that affect acquisition costs?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 4:
Excellent targeting clarity. Service businesses with $250K-$2M annual revenue using legacy systems - that's a well-defined acquisition profile.

**Audience Implications for Your Economics:**
Your $15 cost per sign-up becomes more realistic with this tight targeting. Service businesses actively seeking payment upgrades have higher intent and conversion rates than broad SMB targeting.

**Key Audience Signals:**
- Service verticals: Professional, home, B2B services
- Revenue: $250K-$2M annually 
- Current pain: Legacy systems (Square, traditional merchants)
- Processing volume: $10K-$100K monthly
- Psychographic: Tech-forward but not enterprise-complex

Quick validation: Are there specific service verticals within this profile that convert significantly better than others? For example, do home services outperform professional services, or is performance fairly consistent across service types?

Turn 7:
Smart allocation - aggressive expansion while protecting your strongholds.

**Geographic Budget Allocation:**
- **Tier 1 Markets:** $1.3M (65%) - Denver, Austin, Phoenix, Atlanta
- **Tier 2 Expansion:** $700K (35%) - Nashville, Charlotte, Salt Lake City

**Performance Implications:**
- Tier 1: $1.3M with 15-20% conversion lift = potential for 28,000-30,000 qualified merchants
- Tier 2: $700K in unproven markets = higher risk, potentially 18,000-20,000 qualified merchants if markets perform similarly

This gets you to your 50,000 target if Tier 2 performs at 80-85% of Tier 1 rates.

**Step 6 Value Proposition:** Given home services' frustration with legacy payment systems, what specific pain points does PayStream solve that will resonate most in your messaging? Faster payouts, better reporting, lower fees, or something else that drives switching behavior?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 6:
Excellent - high-growth metros with strong home service economies. That 15-20% conversion lift in your target markets further validates your aggressive efficiency targets.

**Geographic Strategy:**
- **Tier 1:** Denver, Austin, Phoenix, Atlanta (proven performance)
- **Tier 2:** Charlotte, Salt Lake City, Nashville (expansion targets)
- **Profile:** High-growth metros with booming construction/home services

Let me calculate your budget implications:

**Budget Allocation Question:**
With $2M total budget, are you thinking roughly 70-80% in proven Tier 1 markets and 20-30% testing Tier 2 expansion? Or do you want to be more aggressive on the expansion markets?

The conversion lift in your strong markets suggests concentrating more budget there initially, but curious about your growth strategy preference.

Turn 8:
Excellent - speed and financial visibility drive switching behavior more than price alone.

**Value Proposition Framework:**
- **Primary Hook:** 24-48 hour payouts vs. 7-10 day industry standard
- **Secondary Value:** Real-time cash flow visibility for multi-job management
- **Positioning:** Financial operations tool, not just payment processor
- **Switching Trigger:** Business efficiency over cost savings

**Step 7 Channel Strategy:** With your tight targeting (home services in specific metros) and efficiency requirements ($15 per sign-up), we need precision channels.

Given your audience and value prop, I'm thinking:
- **Search:** High-intent "payment solutions for contractors" queries
- **Social:** Facebook/Instagram targeting home service business owners
- **Industry-specific:** Trade publication advertising and associations

Which channels are currently working best for you, or is this launching new acquisition efforts?

Turn 9:
Perfect - your current channels explain why you need better efficiency. LinkedIn and Google can work but often overprice SMB targeting.

**Channel Mix Recommendation:**
- **Search (35% - $700K):** Target high-intent queries like "payment solutions contractors," "fast payments home services"
- **Social Precision (25% - $500K):** Facebook/Instagram with tight behavioral targeting of home service business owners
- **Trade/Industry (20% - $400K):** Direct partnerships with contractor associations, trade publications
- **Programmatic B2B (20% - $400K):** Refine your targeting with home services firmographics

**Why This Works for $15 CPL:**
Trade publications and associations often have lower competition and higher trust. Search captures active intent. Social allows precise behavioral targeting.

**Step 8 Measurement:** Given your 37.5% sign-up to qualified merchant conversion, what's your current attribution setup? Can you track from initial click through to $10K+ processing qualification?
