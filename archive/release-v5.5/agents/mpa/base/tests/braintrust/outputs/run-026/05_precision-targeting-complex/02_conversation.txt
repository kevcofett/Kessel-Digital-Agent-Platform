TURN 1 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I'm the Director of Performance Marketing at LuxeFinance, a wealth management firm. We need to build a precision media plan to acquire high-net-worth individuals - specifically people with $1M+ in investable assets, typically 45-65, executives and business owners who are either approaching retirement or have a major liquidity event coming up. We're interested in people researching tax optimization and estate planning. Budget is $1.5M, targeting 2,500 qualified leads. We have CRM data on 50K existing clients we can use for modeling. Focus on top DMAs by HNW concentration - NYC, SF, LA, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Denver, Miami, Dallas, DC. Quality matters more than volume here.

AGENT:
Hi! I am excited to build a media plan with you. We will cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've provided excellent detail upfront. Let me clarify your primary business objective: Are you looking to acquire new clients (convert leads to managed assets) or generate qualified leads for your sales team to nurture?

The distinction matters because it changes how we measure success and model economics.

TURN 2 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're ultimately looking to acquire new clients and grow our assets under management. While our sales team will definitely nurture these leads, the end goal is converting high-quality prospects into long-term wealth management relationships. We want qualified leads that have a high probability of becoming $5M+ AUM clients, not just form-fills.

AGENT:
Perfect - client acquisition with $5M+ AUM as the ultimate outcome. That's a high-value, long-cycle objective.

For measuring success, what's your primary KPI? Are you tracking:
- Cost per qualified lead (with lead scoring)
- Cost per new client acquired 
- Return on ad spend based on first-year fees
- Something else?

Given the 12-18 month sales cycles typical in wealth management, I want to ensure we're measuring the right leading indicator while keeping the $5M+ AUM end goal in focus.

TURN 3 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I'm most focused on cost per qualified lead with a robust lead scoring model. We want to track MQLs that convert to SQLs, with a clear progression toward AUM acquisition. First-year fee ROAS would be ideal, but given our long sales cycle, we'll need to use lead quality and progression through our funnel as our primary near-term indicator. Our existing client CRM data gives us a strong baseline for scoring leads that look like our most valuable relationships.

AGENT:
Excellent - cost per qualified lead with lead scoring is the right approach for this cycle length.

Let me model your efficiency target: $1.5M budget ÷ 2,500 qualified leads = $600 per MQL.

For wealth management targeting $1M+ investable assets, benchmarks typically run $400-800 per qualified lead based on targeting precision and geography. At $600, you're in the middle of that range - achievable with disciplined audience targeting.

Given your CRM data on 50K clients, this looks realistic. The key will be tight lookalike modeling and behavioral signals that mirror your highest-converting prospects.

What's the typical value of a new client relationship in first-year fees? This helps validate whether $600 per lead creates positive unit economics even before the full AUM conversion.

TURN 4 (Step 2)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our average new client relationship generates around $75-100K in first-year fees, depending on portfolio complexity. With a $600 CAC per MQL, we're looking at an incredibly efficient acquisition model if we can convert even 10-15% of our qualified leads. Our first-party data suggests our ideal client profile has strong signals around recent liquidity events, business ownership transitions, and proactive tax planning research - those behavioral indicators are going to be critical in our lookalike modeling.

AGENT:
Outstanding economics. At $75-100K first-year fees with even 10% conversion, you're looking at $7,500-10,000 revenue per lead against $600 cost - that's 12-16x return. Very strong unit economics that justify premium targeting.

Your behavioral signals around liquidity events and business transitions are exactly right for this efficiency target. Those intent signals will be crucial for hitting qualified leads rather than just high-income browsers.

Moving to Step 3 - Audience. You've outlined the foundation: $1M+ investable assets, 45-65, executives/business owners. 

Let me dig deeper into the behavioral layer: When you say "recent liquidity events" - are we talking business sales, IPOs, real estate exits, or inheritance? The more specific we can get about these trigger moments, the better we can target people actively in transition rather than passively wealthy.

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 5 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're seeing the strongest signals from business sales and IPOs - particularly tech founders and executives who've recently had a liquidity event. Our CRM data shows these segments have the highest propensity to engage with sophisticated wealth management services. Real estate exits are secondary, but still meaningful. Inheritance triggers are harder to target precisely, so we're focusing more on active business transitions where the prospect is likely seeking immediate tax optimization and portfolio restructuring strategies.

AGENT:
Perfect - business sales and IPO liquidity events give us precise targeting opportunities. Tech founders/executives post-liquidity are ideal because they're actively seeking solutions, not just passively wealthy.

For audience precision: Are you targeting people currently in transaction (6-12 months out from liquidity) or recently completed (0-24 months post-event)? 

The timing matters significantly for intent signals and messaging. Pre-liquidity prospects research tax strategies and wealth management options. Post-liquidity prospects need immediate portfolio structuring and ongoing management.

This distinction affects which behavioral signals we layer - forward-looking tax planning content versus post-transaction wealth preservation research.

Events: step_transition

TURN 6 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're primarily focused on the 0-24 months post-event window, with a heavy emphasis on the first 12 months. Our data shows that's when these tech founders and executives are most actively seeking sophisticated wealth management solutions. They're past the initial transaction excitement but still in a strategic planning mode, which makes them incredibly receptive to targeted tax optimization and portfolio restructuring messaging. The key is catching them when they're intellectually engaged but not yet locked into a wealth management strategy.

AGENT:
Excellent timing window - that 0-12 month post-liquidity sweet spot when they're strategically engaged but not yet committed elsewhere.

Moving to Step 4 - Geography. You've identified the top HNW DMAs. Given your focus on tech founders/executives, should we weight allocation toward SF Bay Area and Seattle where tech liquidity events are most concentrated? 

Or do you prefer even distribution across all ten markets? Your budget allows meaningful presence in each DMA, but concentration in tech-heavy markets might yield higher qualified lead rates given your ideal client profile.

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 7 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I want to concentrate our spend - 40% in SF Bay Area and Seattle, then distribute the remaining 60% across other top DMAs. Our data shows these two markets have the highest density of tech liquidity events, so we should lean in hard there. New York and Boston can absorb the next tier of budget, given their financial services and tech crossover markets. The goal is precision over broad reach, so I'd rather have high-quality targeting in key markets than a diluted approach across all ten.

AGENT:
Smart allocation - concentrating 40% in SF/Seattle leverages your highest-conversion markets.

Let me model this: 40% concentration = $600K for SF/Seattle, $900K for remaining 8 markets. At $600 per MQL target, that's 1,000 qualified leads from SF/Seattle and 1,500 from other markets.

Given tech liquidity density, SF/Seattle should outperform that ratio - potentially 1,200+ leads from those markets if targeting is precise.

Moving to Step 5 - Budget allocation. Within your geographic split, how do you want to balance investment across funnel stages? 

Are you thinking 70% acquisition focus with 30% for nurturing/retargeting, or do you prefer heavier acquisition weighting given the long sales cycles and need to build qualified pipeline volume?

Events: calculation_performed, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 8 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Given our long sales cycle and the need to build a robust, high-quality pipeline, I want to go even more aggressive on acquisition - closer to 85% acquisition, 15% nurturing/retargeting. Our first-party data shows that early, precise touchpoints are critical in capturing these high-value prospects. We can't afford to waste budget on lower-intent retargeting when our primary goal is identifying and qualifying those post-liquidity tech founders and executives. The nurturing budget will be laser-focused on moving MQLs to SQLs, not broad remarketing.

AGENT:
Excellent - 85% acquisition maximizes your qualified pipeline building. At $1.5M total, that's $1.275M for acquisition and $225K for MQL-to-SQL nurturing.

This allocation makes sense given your target's sophistication - these prospects do their research thoroughly upfront, so capturing them at first engagement is critical.

Moving to Step 6 - Value Proposition. Given you're targeting post-liquidity tech founders who are intellectually engaged but not yet committed to a wealth manager:

What's your primary value differentiator? Are you positioning around tax optimization expertise, portfolio complexity management, or something else that resonates specifically with this tech-savvy, high-net-worth audience who likely has multiple wealth management options?

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 9 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our core differentiator is sophisticated, proactive tax optimization specifically designed for tech founders - we're not just managing wealth, we're strategically protecting and growing post-liquidity assets through advanced tax planning. Our team understands the unique financial complexity of tech executive portfolios, including equity compensation, stock options, and multi-jurisdictional tax scenarios. We're positioning ourselves as the strategic partner who thinks three moves ahead, not just a traditional wealth management firm.

AGENT:
Powerful positioning - "strategic partner who thinks three moves ahead" perfectly captures the intellectual sophistication these prospects expect.

Your tax optimization angle is spot-on for post-liquidity tech founders dealing with complex equity structures and multi-jurisdictional scenarios. This differentiates you from traditional wealth managers who treat them like any other high-net-worth client.

Moving to Step 7 - Channels. Given your sophisticated audience, premium positioning, and need for precise targeting:

What's your initial thinking on channel priorities? LinkedIn for professional targeting, search for active intent capture, or are you considering other channels that might reach tech executives researching tax optimization strategies?

The $600 per MQL target and 85% acquisition focus will drive our channel selection and budget allocation.
