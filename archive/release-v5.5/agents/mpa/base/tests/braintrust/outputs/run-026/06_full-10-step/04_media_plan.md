# Media Plan Output: Full 10-Step Media Planning

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 15,000 new customers? Are you focused on growing market share, expanding into new segments, or hitting a specific revenue target?

Turn 2:
Perfect! So your objective is market share growth in home decor e-commerce, targeting $5-6M in incremental revenue from 15,000 new customers.

Let me check the math: $5.5M ÷ 15,000 = $367 average customer value. For home decor, that's solid - typical ranges $200-500.

Your efficiency target: $750K ÷ 15,000 = $50 cost per customer. That's aggressive for home decor where benchmarks typically run $75-120. To hit $50, we'll need precise targeting and strong channel efficiency.

How do you measure success as a number? Are you tracking new customer acquisitions, first-purchase revenue, or something else as your primary KPI?

Turn 4:
Perfect! Let me model this out:

At 35% margin on $375 = $131 gross profit per customer
Your target: $50 cost per customer
Gross profit after acquisition: $131 - $50 = $81 profit per customer

That's a healthy 2.6x return on your acquisition spend, which is solid for sustainable growth.

However, $50 cost per customer is still 33-58% below typical home decor benchmarks of $75-120. Based on industry data, you're targeting aggressive efficiency that will require:
- Tight audience targeting
- Strong creative performance
- Efficient channel selection

The math works if executed well. Ready to move to Step 2 and dive into your unit economics to ensure this efficiency target is realistic for your business model?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent! Your primary KPI is new customer acquisitions (15,000) with first-purchase revenue as secondary. Your $350-400 first order target aligns well with the $367 average I calculated.

Now let's validate if your $50 cost per customer is achievable. What's your profit margin on a typical $375 first order? This helps determine how much you can sustainably spend on acquisition while maintaining healthy unit economics.

Turn 5:
Great mindset! Let's validate the economics behind your ambitious targets.

You mentioned 35% margin, which gives us $131 gross profit per $375 order. But for sustainable growth, we need to factor in your customer lifetime value beyond that first purchase.

What's the typical behavior of your customers after their first order? Do you have data on repeat purchase rates or average customer value over 12-24 months? This will help us determine if $50 acquisition cost leaves enough room for long-term profitability and reinvestment.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Got it. I'll model using industry benchmarks for home decor which suggest 12-month LTV of $600-800 based on typical repeat rates. You can adjust this anytime.

Let me calculate what this means for your efficiency targets:

At $700 estimated LTV:
- First order: $375 (35% margin = $131 profit)
- Additional 12-month value: $325 (35% margin = $114 profit)
- Total 12-month profit: $245 per customer

Your $50 acquisition cost against $245 LTV profit = 4.9x return. That's excellent and validates your aggressive target is achievable with strong LTV.

This analysis shows your $50 cost per customer is realistic when factoring in repeat purchases. Ready to move to Step 3 and define your target audience to achieve this efficiency?

Turn 7:
Perfect! Now let's define your target audience to hit that efficient $50 cost per customer.

You mentioned targeting millennials and younger Gen X homeowners for modern, affordable home furnishings. Let's get specific about who converts best for you.

What age range performs best for your business? Are you thinking 25-45, or do you have a tighter sweet spot within that millennial/younger Gen X range?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Excellent! The 30-40 age range is a strong foundation - established income with active home investment.

Beyond age, what other characteristics define your best customers? For example, are they primarily homeowners vs. renters, certain income levels, or specific life stages like new homeowners, recent movers, or growing families?

These details will help us identify the highest-converting segments within that age range and optimize your targeting efficiency.

Turn 9:
Perfect! That's a well-defined, high-value audience:

**Core Segment**: Ages 30-40, homeowners, $75-125K income, urban/suburban metros
**Life stages**: First-time homeowners, recent movers, young couples, growing families
**Psychographics**: Career-focused, design-conscious, style-driven

This profile suggests strong conversion potential - established income, active home investment phase, and digital engagement.

Now for geography: You mentioned Seattle, Austin, Denver, and Chicago. Are these your top-performing markets, or are you looking to expand into new metros? Understanding your geographic priorities will help us allocate budget efficiently across markets.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Great strategic approach! Focused growth with smart expansion testing.

**Primary markets**: Seattle, Austin, Denver, Chicago (proven performance)
**Expansion markets**: Boston, San Francisco, Atlanta (similar demographics)

This gives us 7 major metros with strong professional populations that match your 30-40, $75-125K homeowner profile.

For your $750K budget across 15,000 customers, should we allocate roughly 70-80% to your proven markets and 20-30% to test the expansion cities? Or do you have a different split in mind for balancing growth in strong markets versus new market development?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Perfect! That's a smart allocation:

**Budget Split**:
- 75% ($562K) to proven markets: Seattle, Austin, Denver, Chicago
- 25% ($188K) to test expansion: Boston, San Francisco, Atlanta

**Customer Split**:
- 11,250 customers from proven markets ($50 cost per customer)
- 3,750 customers from expansion markets ($50 cost per customer)

This maintains your efficiency targets while allowing meaningful expansion testing.

Now let's move to Step 5 - Budget. We've established your $750K total and geographic split. How do you want to allocate budget across the year? Are you planning steady monthly investment, or do you have seasonal patterns or launch timing that should drive the pacing?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 13:
Perfect! Let me update the allocation:

**Revised Seasonal Budget**:
- Q1: 20% = $150K (steady presence)
- Q2: 25% = $187.5K (spring refresh peak)
- Q3: 25% = $187.5K (summer maintenance + early fall prep)
- Q4: 30% = $225K (holiday entertaining peak)

This gives you strong presence during both peak seasons while maintaining year-round visibility.

Now for Step 6 - Value Proposition. You've mentioned "modern, affordable home furnishings" for design-conscious professionals. What key message or benefit resonates most with your 30-40 year old homeowner audience? Is it the affordability, the modern aesthetic, the convenience, or something else that drives conversions?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 12:
Smart seasonal strategy! Let me map out your budget allocation:

**Seasonal Budget Split**:
- Q1: 20% = $150K (steady presence)
- Q2: 25% = $187.5K (spring refresh peak)
- Q3: 20% = $150K (summer maintenance)
- Q4: 35% = $262.5K (holiday entertaining peak)

Wait - I show Q4 at 35% vs. your mentioned 15%. Did you mean 35% total for both peak seasons (25% Q2 + 10% Q4), or should Q4 be higher given holiday entertaining importance?

Just want to ensure we capture your seasonal strategy correctly before moving to value proposition development.

Turn 14:
Excellent! Your value proposition is clear and compelling:

**Core Value Proposition**: "Democratizing great design"
- Modern, sophisticated pieces that look professionally curated
- Accessible pricing for design-conscious professionals
- Carefully edited collections (removes decision paralysis)
- Online convenience for time-pressed customers

This resonates perfectly with your 30-40 year old professional audience who want style without designer budgets.

Ready for Step 7 - Channels? Given your target audience (digitally savvy professionals), budget allocation, and value proposition, we can now build your channel strategy. Which platforms have performed best for you historically, or are you starting fresh across all channels?

────────────────────────────────────────
