TURN 1 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Hi, I'm the Marketing Manager at HomeStyle Direct. We're an e-commerce company selling home goods. I need to build a media plan for Q1-Q2. We have a $400K budget and need to acquire 5,000 new customers. Our average customer LTV is $320. Can you help me put together a plan?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've given me great detail to start! Let me analyze what you've shared:

**Your Numbers:**
- $400K budget ÷ 5,000 customers = $80 cost per customer
- Customer LTV of $320 means 4:1 return ratio

For home goods e-commerce, typical cost per customer runs $60-100, so your $80 target sits right in the sweet spot - ambitious but achievable.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 5,000 new customers? Are you focused on revenue growth, market share expansion, or something else?

TURN 2 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're primarily focused on revenue growth. We've seen good traction with our online store, and we want to capitalize on that momentum by expanding our customer base. Our goal is to increase total sales by about 35% in Q1-Q2 through these new customer acquisitions.

AGENT:
Perfect! Revenue growth through customer base expansion is clear. Let me update the projections:

**Revenue Impact:**
- 5,000 new customers × $320 LTV = $1.6M in customer value
- 35% sales increase suggests strong growth trajectory

Your primary KPI will be new customer acquisitions, measured as a number. With your $80 cost per customer target and $320 LTV, you're targeting a 4:1 return ratio.

One key question on the economics: Do you know what customers typically spend in their first purchase versus the $320 lifetime value? This helps us understand payback timing and cash flow.

TURN 3 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We see an average first purchase around $120-$140. Most of our LTV comes from repeat purchases over 12-18 months. Our product mix of furniture and home décor tends to encourage customers to come back and buy complementary items. So while the first purchase isn't huge, we know our retention and cross-selling strategy works well.

AGENT:
Excellent! That's a healthy first purchase range and strong repeat business model. Let me update our efficiency picture:

**Economics Check:**
- First purchase: $120-140 vs $80 acquisition cost
- Immediate payback: 1.5-1.75x (very healthy)
- Full LTV: 4x over 12-18 months

This is solid unit economics. Your immediate payback covers acquisition cost plus profit, and the long-term return is strong for e-commerce. The $80 cost per customer is definitely achievable given these fundamentals.

Moving to Step 3 - Audience. Who is your ideal customer? Can you describe the demographics and behaviors of your best-performing customers?

TURN 4 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our core audience is homeowners aged 30-55, mostly professionals or young families who are setting up or refreshing their homes. They're design-conscious, have disposable income, and value quality over the cheapest option. They tend to shop online, are active on social media, and care about aesthetics and functionality in home goods. Pinterest and Instagram are big inspiration sources for them.

AGENT:
Great audience definition! Design-conscious homeowners 30-55 with disposable income is a strong target. The Pinterest/Instagram behavior signals are valuable for channel planning later.

A few quick refinements to sharpen our targeting:

**Household Income:** What income range best describes your core customers? This affects media costs and channel efficiency.

**Geographic Concentration:** Do you see stronger performance in certain regions, or is demand fairly even across the US?

**Home Ownership vs Lifestyle Stage:** Are recent home buyers particularly valuable, or is it more about people in refreshing/upgrading mode regardless of when they bought?

TURN 5 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our core customers are typically in the $85K-$150K household income range. Geographically, we see pretty consistent demand nationwide, though metro areas like Seattle, Denver, Austin, and the Northeast corridor tend to be slightly stronger. As for lifecycle, we're more focused on people in upgrade/refresh mode versus strictly recent home buyers - so it's about the mindset of wanting to improve their living spaces, not just tied to a recent home purchase.

AGENT:
Perfect! That income range ($85K-$150K) aligns well with your $120-140 first purchase behavior. The upgrade/refresh mindset is more sustainable than chasing just new home buyers.

**Audience Summary:**
- Homeowners 30-55, $85K-$150K income
- Design-conscious, quality-focused
- Upgrade/refresh mindset vs. move-in driven
- Strong social media engagement (Pinterest/Instagram)
- Metro concentration but national demand

Moving to Step 4 - Geography. Since you mentioned metro areas like Seattle, Denver, Austin, and Northeast perform slightly better, should we weight budget toward these stronger markets, or do you prefer even national distribution to test broader expansion?

TURN 6 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I think we should do a slight budget weighting - maybe 70% national, 30% concentrated in those metro markets. We want to capitalize on our stronger regions but not limit our potential growth. The goal is to test and learn while maintaining broad market reach. Our product seems to have nationwide appeal, so we don't want to over-concentrate and miss opportunities in other regions.

AGENT:
Smart approach! 70/30 split balances optimization with growth discovery.

**Geography Plan:**
- 70% national: $280K for broad reach
- 30% metro focus: $120K in Seattle, Denver, Austin, Northeast
- Tests expansion potential while leveraging proven markets

**Updated Targets:**
- National: ~3,500 customers at $80 each
- Metro focus: ~1,500 customers with potentially better efficiency

Moving to Step 5 - Budget. You've allocated geography, but how do you want to split the $400K between acquisition channels versus retention/repeat purchase campaigns? Since your LTV model depends heavily on repeat business, some budget for existing customer reactivation might boost overall returns.

TURN 7 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I think we should allocate about 85% to new customer acquisition and 15% to retention efforts. Our primary goal is growth, but we can't ignore the customers who've already bought from us. The retention budget can help drive those repeat purchases and increase our overall lifetime value. So roughly $340K for acquisition and $60K for retention campaigns targeting our existing customer base.

AGENT:
Excellent allocation! That 85/15 split prioritizes growth while protecting your LTV model.

**Budget Structure:**
- $340K acquisition (85%): Targets 4,250 new customers at $80 each
- $60K retention (15%): Drives repeat purchases to boost LTV
- **Gap Alert:** You need 5,000 customers but $340K only funds 4,250

You're 750 customers short of your 5,000 target. Two options: increase acquisition budget to $400K (no retention), or adjust target to 4,250 customers. Given your repeat-purchase model, the retention investment is smart.

Which direction makes more sense - prioritize the 5,000 customer target or maintain the retention budget?

TURN 8 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I just got out of a meeting with leadership. They're pushing for 8,000 customers instead of 5,000. The board wants more aggressive growth. Is that realistic with our current budget? What would we need to change?

AGENT:
Let me update our projections. $340K acquisition budget ÷ 8,000 customers = $42.50 per customer. 

**Reality Check:**
Your target is now 47% more efficient than our $80 baseline. For home goods, $42.50 is extremely aggressive - typical runs $60-100. You'd be targeting the top 5% efficiency range.

**The Math:**
- 8,000 customers × $80 realistic cost = $640K needed
- Current acquisition budget: $340K  
- **Shortfall: $300K**

**Options:**
1. Increase total budget to ~$700K ($640K acquisition + $60K retention)
2. Target 4,250 customers with current budget (realistic)
3. Accept $42.50 efficiency target (requires perfect execution)

To hit 8,000 at $42.50, you'd need extremely tight targeting, premium creative, and likely some luck. What's leadership's flexibility on budget versus timeline?
