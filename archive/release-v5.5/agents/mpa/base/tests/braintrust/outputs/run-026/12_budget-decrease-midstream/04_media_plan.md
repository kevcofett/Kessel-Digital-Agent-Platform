# Media Plan Output: Budget Decrease Midstream

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by calculating what your targets mean: $1M budget ÷ 500 opportunities = $2,000 per qualified opportunity. For enterprise B2B with $150K average deal size, this is quite efficient - typical cost per opportunity runs $2,500-4,000.

Your business outcome is generating qualified opportunities for enterprise data infrastructure sales. What specific criteria define a "qualified opportunity" for your sales team?

Turn 2:
Perfect - that's a clear qualification definition. So your primary KPI is qualified opportunities (meetings with VP/Director level at 5000+ employee companies with budget, need, and interest).

You've set a target of 500 qualified opportunities. At $150K average deal size, if you close even 10-15% of these opportunities, that's $7.5-11.25M in potential revenue from a $1M investment.

Your $2,000 cost per opportunity target is aggressive but achievable for enterprise B2B. To confirm this volume target makes sense for your sales capacity: can your enterprise sales team realistically handle 500 qualified discovery calls over the year?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Perfect. Let me validate the economics: 500 opportunities × 13.5% close rate (midpoint) = 68 deals × $150K = $10.2M in potential revenue from your $1M investment. That's a 10:1 return, which is excellent for enterprise B2B.

Your $2,000 per opportunity target is realistic - you have the math working in your favor.

Moving to Step 3 - Audience. You've defined the company profile (5000+ employees) and seniority (VP/Director level). To build targeting that can efficiently reach these decision-makers, I need to understand their behavioral patterns.

What typically triggers these data and IT leaders to start evaluating new infrastructure solutions? Is it growth scaling, system failures, compliance requirements, or something else?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - 500 opportunities across 6 AEs gives each rep about 20-21 opportunities per quarter, which is well within your 40-45 capacity. That's smart planning.

Now for economics: with $150K average deal size, what's your typical close rate on qualified opportunities? This helps us understand the revenue potential and validates whether $2,000 per opportunity makes economic sense for your business.

Turn 5:
Excellent - those are strong intent signals. Data sprawl, performance bottlenecks, and cloud migration create urgency that drives faster evaluation cycles.

To build precise targeting around these pain points: when these leaders are actively researching solutions, what content do they typically consume? Are they reading specific publications, attending certain events, engaging with particular types of content, or searching for specific terms related to data infrastructure challenges?

Understanding their research behavior helps us identify where and how to reach them when they're in active evaluation mode.

Turn 6:
Perfect - that gives us strong targeting signals. These leaders consume technical content from credible sources and attend major industry events. Their LinkedIn engagement and preference for substantive content over marketing fluff is crucial for messaging.

One more audience dimension: geographically, are you targeting globally, specific regions, or primarily North America? Enterprise data infrastructure often has geographic considerations around data residency, compliance, and local support requirements.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Let me recalculate the implications: $600K ÷ 500 opportunities = $1,200 per opportunity. That's 40% more efficient than your original $2,000 target and significantly below typical enterprise B2B benchmarks of $2,500-4,000.

This is extremely aggressive. At $1,200 per opportunity, you'd need exceptional targeting precision and channel efficiency. 

You have three realistic options:
1. Reduce volume target to ~300 opportunities (maintains $2,000 efficiency)
2. Extend timeline to 15-18 months (spreads budget for learning cycles)
3. Pursue the 500 target knowing it requires near-perfect execution

Given your sales capacity can handle 500 opportunities and the strong revenue potential ($10.2M), which direction feels most aligned with business priorities?

Turn 8:
Understood - you're going for maximum efficiency with surgical precision. At $1,200 per opportunity, every dollar must perform.

Before we build the targeting and channel strategy, I need to complete our audience foundation. You mentioned technical content consumption and industry events, but I still need geography.

Are you targeting globally, specific regions, or primarily North America? With this budget constraint, geographic focus becomes even more critical - we can't afford to spread thin across multiple time zones or regulatory environments.

Turn 9:
Smart geographic focus. Three mature markets with concentrated enterprise tech spending maximizes efficiency at your budget level.

Moving to Step 5 - Budget allocation. With $600K across US (60-65%), UK, and Germany, that gives you roughly:
- US: $360-390K 
- UK/Germany: $105-120K each

At these levels, each market needs surgical targeting. The US budget of $360-390K for ~300 opportunities means $1,200-1,300 per opportunity, while UK/Germany at ~100 opportunities each need similar efficiency.

For your value proposition: given these data leaders consume technical content and hate marketing fluff, how do you typically position DataScale's differentiation? What specific capability or outcome resonates most with prospects facing data sprawl and performance bottlenecks?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Excellent positioning - "radical infrastructure simplification" with quantified outcomes (40-50% reduction in sprawl, sub-second performance) speaks directly to their pain points. That's compelling for technical buyers drowning in complexity.

Moving to Step 7 - Channels. Given your $600K budget, surgical targeting needs, and technical audience consuming deep content, we need maximum efficiency channels.

Based on your audience behavior (LinkedIn engagement, technical publications, industry events) and need for precision targeting, I'm seeing three primary channel tiers:

**Tier 1 (60-70% budget):** LinkedIn targeted campaigns + ABM
**Tier 2 (20-25% budget):** Technical publication sponsorships  
**Tier 3 (10-15% budget):** Event/webinar programs

Does this channel prioritization align with where you've seen best performance, or are there other channels that have driven qualified enterprise opportunities for you?

Turn 11:
Good adjustment. Let me revise based on your performance data:

**Tier 1 (60% budget):** LinkedIn ABM - $360K
**Tier 2 (30% budget):** Technical publication sponsorships - $180K  
**Tier 3 (10% budget):** Targeted digital placements - $60K

This gives you $360K for LinkedIn ABM (targeting ~300 opportunities at $1,200 each), $180K for content-driven publications where you've seen strong conversion, and $60K for testing other targeted placements.

Moving to Step 8 - Measurement. With your aggressive $1,200 efficiency target, measurement precision is critical. How are you currently tracking opportunity attribution, and what's your process for connecting marketing touchpoints to qualified discovery calls?
