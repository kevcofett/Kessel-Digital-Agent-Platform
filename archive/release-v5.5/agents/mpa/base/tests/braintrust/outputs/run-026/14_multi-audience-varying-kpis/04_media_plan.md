# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience with Different KPIs Per Segment

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I am excited to build this multi-segment media plan with you. We will cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've outlined a sophisticated three-segment approach with distinct objectives - this is exactly how automotive should be planned. Let me start with your conquest segment since awareness campaigns require the clearest outcome definition.

For Segment 1 (Conquest/Awareness, ~$1.58M budget): You mentioned the goal is shifting consideration for future purchases 2-3 years out. 

What specific awareness outcome would indicate success? Are you targeting brand recall lift, consideration shift measured through surveys, or increased organic search volume for your dealership brands?

Turn 2:
Perfect. Brand recall lift and consideration shift are solid awareness objectives. Let me model the efficiency implications.

For brand lift campaigns in automotive, meaningful recall increases typically require 3-5 frequency against your target audience. At $1.58M for conquest, if we assume your competitor vehicle owners represent roughly 60% of the local automotive market across your 12 dealerships, we're looking at substantial reach requirements.

Based on automotive brand lift benchmarks, achieving 15-20% consideration shift typically costs $8-15 per person reached effectively. This suggests your conquest budget could reach approximately 100K-200K people with proper frequency.

Before we lock this efficiency assumption, what's the primary KPI number you'll track? Is it the percentage point increase in spontaneous brand mention (targeting +15-20 points), or are you measuring this differently?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 4:
Let me check those efficiency targets. At $2.03M budget with $250-300 per test drive appointment, you're projecting 6,800-8,100 appointments annually. That's aggressive efficiency for automotive - market typically runs $400-600 per appointment based on industry benchmarks.

At your $250-300 target, you're aiming 33-50% below typical. This will require very tight targeting to in-market shoppers and strong funnel conversion from your BDC.

Now for Segment 3 (Loyalty/Retention, ~$900K budget): You mentioned service appointments, trade-in inquiries, lease renewals as retention actions.

What's your primary KPI for the loyalty segment? Cost per service appointment, cost per trade-in lead, or are you tracking retention revenue per dollar spent?

Turn 5:
Let me model Segment 3. At $900K budget with $100 per service appointment, you're targeting 9,000 incremental service visits annually. Your $450 average RO means each appointment generates $450 in service revenue, giving you a 4.5:1 return on the appointment cost.

This efficiency looks realistic for retention marketing since you're targeting existing customers with known service history.

Now I need to validate your geographic scope. You mentioned 12 dealerships across 3 brands - what markets are you covering? This will help assess if your audience sizing and efficiency targets align with local market density.

Turn 6:
Perfect. Three metro areas with dense dealership coverage gives you strong geographic concentration for efficient targeting. The 50-mile radius approach maximizes your service area reach while maintaining cost efficiency.

Let me calculate your total efficiency picture across all segments:

**Budget Allocation:**
- Conquest: $1.58M → 1,600-10,500 people reached (wide range based on frequency strategy)
- In-Market: $2.03M → 6,800-8,100 test drive appointments 
- Loyalty: $900K → 9,000 service appointments + trade-in leads

Your in-market efficiency at $250-300 per appointment is 33-50% more aggressive than typical automotive benchmarks ($400-600). Your loyalty and conquest targets look achievable.

What's your total customer database size across all 12 dealerships? This will help us assess if your loyalty segment can realistically generate 9,000 incremental service appointments from your existing customer base.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Got it. $8-15 per person reached with your +15-20 point lift target gives us a solid efficiency framework for conquest.

Now let's define Segment 2 (In-Market/Lead Gen, ~$2.03M budget). You mentioned the goal is leads - VDP views, form fills, calls, test drive appointments.

What's your primary KPI for in-market performance? Are you measuring cost per lead, cost per test drive appointment, or tracking all the way to cost per sale?

Turn 8:
Smart targeting. Honda/Toyota/Nissan owners at 3-5 years hit the sweet spot where maintenance costs rise and trade consideration begins.

For Segment 2 (In-Market), you mentioned active shoppers on Autotrader, Cars.com, checking reviews. 

Are you targeting all active automotive shoppers in your metro areas, or do you want to focus on specific vehicle categories, price ranges, or buyer types that align best with your three brand portfolios?

Turn 9:
Perfect segmentation approach. Three brands with distinct positioning ($25K-50K range) targeting professionals and families with 680+ credit scores gives you clear audience definition for in-market targeting.

For Segment 3 (Loyalty), you have 65,000 customers in your database. 

Do you want to target all existing customers with retention messaging, or segment by service frequency, purchase recency, or specific lifecycle triggers like lease expiration dates and service intervals?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Excellent. 65,000 customers with 40% in actionable windows (26,000 people) means targeting 9,000 incremental appointments represents about 35% activation rate. That's ambitious but achievable with strong retention messaging.

Your efficiency targets are now clear across all three segments. Let me move to audience definition.

For Segment 1 (Conquest), you want competitor vehicle owners who could consider your brands in 2-3 years. 

What competitor brands are you specifically targeting, and do you want to focus on owners of vehicles that are 3-5 years old (approaching typical trade-in cycle), or cast wider to include newer vehicle owners for longer-term consideration building?

Turn 11:
Perfect geographic weighting based on dealership density and market size. Indianapolis at 45-50%, Cincinnati at 30%, Louisville at 20-25% aligns your media investment with operational capacity.

Let me calculate your geographic budget distribution:

**Indianapolis (45-50%):** $2.0-2.25M
**Cincinnati (30%):** $1.35M  
**Louisville (20-25%):** $900K-1.1M

This gives each market sufficient scale while concentrating investment where you have strongest presence.

Your budget is $4.5M total across three segments and three markets. Given your aggressive efficiency targets (especially $250-300 per test drive appointment vs $400-600 industry standard), what's driving your confidence in achieving below-market costs? Is it superior targeting, strong creative, or operational advantages through your BDC?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Excellent lifecycle targeting. Three sub-segments with specific triggers maximizes relevance and efficiency for your retention spend.

Now let's finalize geography. You mentioned Indianapolis, Cincinnati, and Louisville metro areas with 50-mile radius coverage around 12 dealerships.

Are you planning equal budget allocation across all three metros, or do you want to weight spend based on market size, dealership concentration, or competitive landscape in each market?

Turn 12:
Excellent rationale. Superior BDC performance, CRM technology, and multi-brand matching capability can absolutely drive efficiency below market benchmarks. Your operational advantages justify the aggressive targets.

Now for value proposition development. You have three distinct segments requiring different messaging approaches.

For Segment 1 (Conquest), you're targeting Honda/Toyota/Nissan owners approaching trade-in cycle. What value proposition will resonate with these customers to shift consideration toward your brands? Is it better value, superior service experience, or something else that differentiates you from their current brand loyalty?

Turn 13:
Strong positioning. "Smarter alternative" with total cost of ownership focus differentiates well against entrenched brand loyalty. The financial intelligence angle should resonate with professionals.

For Segment 2 (In-Market), you're targeting active shoppers across three price bands with different brand positioning. 

What's your core value proposition for in-market shoppers? Given your budget-oriented, mid-market performance, and near-luxury brands, are you emphasizing selection breadth, competitive pricing, or the ability to match exact needs across your portfolio?

Turn 14:
Perfect. Portfolio breadth as a "perfect mobility solution" positions you as the destination rather than just another dealer. The no-compromise messaging should drive strong test drive conversion.

For Segment 3 (Loyalty), you're targeting existing customers with service, trade-in, and contract renewal opportunities.

What value proposition will drive retention actions from your 65,000-customer base? Is it convenience, exclusive benefits, relationship continuity, or something else that keeps them engaged with your dealerships?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 15:
Excellent. "Trusted automotive partner for life" with predictive care creates strong retention value. The ecosystem approach should drive consistent engagement across service and trade touchpoints.

Now let's build your channel strategy. Given three distinct objectives and segments, you'll need different channel approaches for each.

For Segment 1 (Conquest/Awareness, $1.58M), you need reach and frequency against Honda/Toyota/Nissan owners for brand recall lift. 

What channels are you considering for awareness building? Are you thinking traditional reach vehicles like CTV/Linear TV, or digital awareness channels like video and display?

Turn 16:
Smart channel mix for awareness. CTV/YouTube for precision targeting, Linear TV for broad reach, display for reinforcement creates comprehensive coverage.

Let me model your conquest allocation. At $1.58M for awareness across three metros:

**Suggested split:** 40-50% CTV/YouTube ($630K-790K), 30-35% Linear TV ($475K-550K), 15-20% Display ($240K-315K)

This gives you precision targeting capability while maintaining broad reach for brand building.

For Segment 2 (In-Market/Lead Gen, $2.03M), you need qualified leads that convert to test drives at $250-300 per appointment.

What channels are you planning for lead generation? Are you thinking search-heavy with social prospecting, or including automotive inventory sites like Autotrader and Cars.com where your targets are actively shopping?

Turn 17:
Excellent performance funnel. Search captures intent, auto sites meet shoppers where they browse, social handles mid-funnel research with retargeting conversion.

Let me model your in-market allocation at $2.03M:

**Search (40-45%):** $810K-915K
**Auto Sites (25-30%):** $505K-610K  
**Social/Retargeting (20-25%):** $405K-505K

This distribution should efficiently drive your 6,800-8,100 test drive appointments at target $250-300 cost.

For Segment 3 (Loyalty/Retention, $900K), you need service appointments and trade-in leads from existing customers.

What channels work best for reaching your 65,000-customer database? Are you thinking email/CRM-driven campaigns, or adding paid channels to amplify retention messaging?

Turn 18:
Perfect retention approach. CRM-driven personalization as primary driver, direct mail for digital non-responders, and social/display for re-engagement creates comprehensive customer lifecycle coverage.

Your channel strategy is well-structured across all three segments. Now let's establish measurement frameworks for each objective.

For Segment 1 (Conquest/Awareness), your primary KPI is +15-20 point brand recall lift measured through third-party surveys.

How frequently will you measure brand tracking, and what secondary metrics will indicate if awareness campaigns are building toward that lift target?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 19:
Excellent measurement approach. Quarterly tracking with organic search and engagement signals provides early momentum indicators before full survey validation.

For Segment 2 (In-Market/Lead Gen), your primary KPI is cost per test drive appointment at $250-300.

What attribution window and methodology will you use to track leads to appointments? Are you using last-click, multi-touch, or platform-native attribution to measure your search and auto site performance?

Turn 20:
Smart attribution approach. 30-day multi-touch with CRM integration gives you true conversion visibility from click to appointment. Quality focus over volume aligns with your efficiency targets.

For Segment 3 (Loyalty/Retention), your primary KPI is cost per service RO under $100.

How will you track incremental service appointments versus baseline activity? Are you using holdout groups, year-over-year comparison, or another methodology to isolate campaign impact from organic service patterns?

Turn 21:
Excellent incrementality approach. Holdout groups with DMS baseline comparison will give you clean measurement of true retention marketing impact versus organic service patterns.

Now let's establish testing strategy across your three segments. Given your aggressive efficiency targets, testing will be critical for optimization.

For Segment 1 (Conquest), what elements do you want to test to maximize brand recall lift? Are you planning creative testing, frequency optimization, or channel mix experiments?

Turn 22:
Smart testing framework. Creative value prop testing with frequency optimization will help you efficiently hit that +15-20 point brand lift target.

For Segment 2 (In-Market), what will you test to achieve your aggressive $250-300 per test drive appointment target? Are you focusing on audience refinement, creative optimization, or channel performance?

Turn 24:
Critical insight. Your BDC capacity and process precision are the lynchpin for achieving those aggressive efficiency targets. Operational execution risk could undermine excellent media strategy.

**Key risks I'd add:**

**Attribution complexity:** Three different measurement methodologies across segments creates potential for misallocation if incrementality validation fails.

**Budget reallocation pressure:** If in-market segment struggles to hit $250-300 per appointment, there will be pressure to shift budget from awareness - potentially undermining long-term consideration building.

**Channel saturation:** Your target audiences overlap across segments. Conquest and in-market campaigns may compete for the same Honda/Toyota/Nissan owners, driving up costs.

**Recommendation:** Build BDC capacity monitoring into your measurement framework. Track lead-to-appointment conversion rates by segment weekly. If operational bottlenecks emerge, you'll need rapid budget reallocation protocols.

Your three-segment strategy is sophisticated and well-structured. The biggest success factor will be operational execution matching your strategic precision. Ready to finalize allocation details or address any other concerns?

Turn 25:
Perfect. Execution precision with real-time monitoring will be critical for this multi-segment approach to succeed.

**Final Plan Summary:**

**Total Budget:** $4.5M across 3 segments, 3 metros
- Indianapolis (45-50%): $2.0-2.25M
- Cincinnati (30%): $1.35M  
- Louisville (20-25%): $900K-1.1M

**Segment 1 - Conquest:** $1.58M for +15-20 point brand recall lift
**Segment 2 - In-Market:** $2.03M for 6,800-8,100 test drives at $250-300
**Segment 3 - Loyalty:** $900K for 9,000 service appointments at <$100

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Weekly BDC conversion monitoring by segment
- Real-time budget reallocation triggers
- Audience overlap management across segments
- Incrementality validation for all three measurement approaches

Your strategy balances long-term consideration building with aggressive performance targets. The operational execution discipline you're planning should deliver strong results across all three objectives.

This multi-segment approach positions you well for both immediate performance and sustained growth. Your team clearly understands the execution complexity required to make this work.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 23:
Excellent testing approach. Micro-targeting with value prop testing should help you hit those aggressive efficiency targets through precision optimization.

Finally, let's identify risks across your three-segment strategy. Given your operational complexity and aggressive targets, what do you see as the biggest threats to plan success?

What concerns you most about executing this multi-segment approach - is it operational coordination, measurement complexity, or something else?
