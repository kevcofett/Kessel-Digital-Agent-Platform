# Media Plan Output: Demographic Shift Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've given me great starting data. Let me run the numbers on your efficiency target:

$1.5M ÷ 100K customers = $15 cost per customer

With $350 customer value, that's a 23:1 return ratio. This is extremely aggressive - streetwear typically runs $25-45 per customer based on competitive benchmarks. At $15, you're targeting 40-67% better efficiency than market standard.

This is ambitious but not impossible with precise targeting and strong creative. To hit this efficiency, we'll need laser-focused audience definition.

What specific business outcome drives this 100K customer goal - is this about market share growth, revenue targets, or something else?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Got it - this is about proving scalable growth momentum for market leadership. That context helps explain the aggressive efficiency target.

Let me clarify your primary success metric. When you say "100K new customers," how are you defining that number? Are these:

- First-time purchasers (people who buy once)
- Active customers (people who buy within a specific timeframe) 
- Repeat customers (people who make multiple purchases)

This matters because it affects how we measure success and what efficiency is realistic to achieve.

Turn 3:
Perfect - first-time purchasers with repeat purchase validation. That clarifies your success definition.

Let me update the economics with your $350 customer value:

$1.5M ÷ 100K customers = $15 cost per customer
$350 customer value ÷ $15 cost = 23:1 return ratio

This efficiency target is extremely aggressive. Streetwear brands typically see $25-45 per customer acquisition. At $15, you're targeting 40-67% better than market benchmarks.

For context, this level of efficiency usually requires either exceptional first-party data, viral creative performance, or very tight audience precision. Given your market leadership goals, hitting this would definitely signal scalable growth to leadership.

Do you have existing customer data we can use for lookalike targeting, or will this primarily be prospecting to cold audiences?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Excellent - 50K customers is solid foundation data for lookalike modeling. That should help with efficiency since lookalikes typically outperform cold prospecting by 20-30%.

Your mix approach makes sense for this scale target. Let me model the blended efficiency:

**Efficiency Reality Check:**
- Lookalike audiences: ~$12-18 per customer (better performance)  
- Cold prospecting: ~$18-25 per customer (broader reach needed for volume)
- Blended target: $15 per customer

The math works if roughly 60-70% comes from lookalike/warm audiences and 30-40% from cold prospecting. This is achievable but requires excellent creative and tight audience definition.

Now that we have your acquisition framework clear, what's your target volume breakdown? Are you aiming for steady 8,300 customers per month, or do you have seasonal peaks and valleys we should plan around?

Turn 5:
Perfect - that seasonal pattern makes total sense for streetwear. Let me map out your volume distribution:

**Seasonal Volume Targets:**
- Peak periods (Jun-Aug, Nov-Dec): ~45K customers (45%)
- Back-to-school (Aug-Sep overlap): Built into summer peak  
- Steady state (9 months): ~55K customers (55%)
- Average steady: ~6,100/month vs your 6-7K estimate ✓

This seasonal approach actually helps your $15 efficiency target. Peak periods with product drops should see better conversion rates, while steady-state months allow for audience testing and optimization.

The timing also aligns well with when your Millennial audience has disposable income - summer activities and holiday shopping.

Now let's define your audience precision. You mentioned Millennials 25-40 into streetwear and urban fashion. What behavioral signals beyond age help you identify your ideal customer - things like shopping habits, lifestyle interests, or brand affinities?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent - that's a rich behavioral profile that goes well beyond demographics. Those lifestyle signals should help significantly with targeting precision.

**Your Audience Profile:**
- Core: Style-conscious urban lifestyle curators
- Behaviors: Streetwear influencer followers, hip hop culture engagement, festival attendance
- Platforms: Instagram/TikTok native users
- Mindset: Fashion as personal expression, authenticity-focused
- Interests: Sneaker collecting, music scene participation

This level of detail is exactly what can drive your $15 efficiency target. Platforms can identify these behavioral signals much more precisely than just "Millennials 25-40."

One key question for targeting: Do you have stronger brand recognition in specific urban markets, or is awareness fairly even across your top 25 DMAs? This affects whether we should weight budget toward established markets or spread evenly for maximum expansion.

Turn 7:
Perfect - that's a classic growth brand challenge. You need to balance proven markets for efficiency with expansion markets for scale.

**Geographic Strategy Framework:**
- Tier 1 (LA, NYC, Atlanta): Higher investment density for optimization
- Tier 2 (Chicago, Houston, Miami, etc.): Expansion investment for market development
- Remaining top 25 DMAs: Baseline presence for national awareness

This approach should support your $15 efficiency target by letting proven markets drive performance while expansion markets build the volume needed for 100K customers.

Given your $1.5M budget and 100K customer goal, what's your thinking on budget allocation? Are you planning to weight more heavily toward your proven markets, or do you want to distribute more evenly to maximize national expansion?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Great catch - Gen Z pivot is smart for streetwear! Let me recalculate how this affects your efficiency:

**Updated Economics:**
Gen Z typically has lower disposable income than Millennials, so your $350 customer value might be optimistic. Gen Z streetwear customers usually run $200-280 lifetime value.

If we model at $250 LTV (conservative Gen Z estimate):
$250 ÷ $15 target cost = 16.7:1 return ratio

This is even more aggressive than your original 23:1 target. Gen Z acquisition also typically costs $20-35 for streetwear due to platform competition.

**Key Changes:**
- Platform mix shifts heavily toward TikTok/Instagram 
- Creative needs to be more trend-driven and authentic
- Influence marketing becomes more critical
- Purchase cycles may be shorter but order values lower

Do you have data on your actual Gen Z customer value, or should I model using industry benchmarks while we validate this assumption?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Excellent - $300 LTV is much more workable. Let me update:

**Revised Economics:**
$1.5M ÷ 100K customers = $15 cost per customer
$300 LTV ÷ $15 cost = 20:1 return ratio

Still aggressive but more realistic for Gen Z with strong repeat purchase strategy. Limited drops and collabs are smart for driving frequency.

**Gen Z Efficiency Reality:**
- Industry benchmark: $20-35 per customer for streetwear
- Your target: $15 per customer  
- Gap: 25-57% better than typical

This efficiency requires excellent creative and platform optimization, especially on TikTok where Gen Z discovery happens.

We now have your foundation locked: 100K Gen Z customers, $15 acquisition cost, seasonal peaks, and behavioral targeting around urban lifestyle/music culture.

Ready to move to Step 3 - Audience? I want to dive deeper into Gen Z behavioral signals that will drive your targeting precision.

Turn 10:
Perfect - you understand that Gen Z buys culture, not just clothes. That insight is crucial for targeting precision.

**Cultural Ecosystem Signals for Targeting:**
- Authenticity-driven: Follows micro-influencers over celebrities
- Social proof reliant: Engages heavily with user-generated content
- Lifestyle integration: Brands must feel native to their world
- Limited drop culture: FOMO and exclusivity drive engagement

This behavioral depth is exactly what can hit your $15 efficiency target. Platforms can identify users who engage with authentic streetwear content vs. mass fashion advertising.

For targeting refinement: Within this Gen Z cultural ecosystem, do you see distinct sub-segments? For example, are there differences between the sneakerhead community, the music festival crowd, and the social media fashion influencers - or is there significant overlap in your ideal customer?
