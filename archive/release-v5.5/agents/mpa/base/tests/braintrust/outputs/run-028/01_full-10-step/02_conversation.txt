TURN 1 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Hi! I'm the Marketing Director at HomeStyle Decor. We sell home decor and furniture online. I'm looking to build a comprehensive media plan for next year. Our annual budget is $750K and we want to acquire 15,000 new customers.

AGENT:
Your $50 CAC target is right in the sweet spot. Based on Knowledge Base, typical ecommerce CAC is $20-80, so this is very achievable.

What specific business outcome are you trying to drive with these 15,000 new customers?

Events: benchmark_cited

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 2 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're really focused on driving sustainable revenue growth and expanding our market share in the home decor space. With these 15,000 new customers, we're looking to increase our annual revenue by about 20-25% and build a stronger foundation for long-term customer relationships. Our average customer lifetime value is around $450, so we see this as a solid investment in our future growth.

AGENT:
Excellent. With $450 LTV and $50 CAC, your 9:1 ratio is strong. Based on Knowledge Base benchmarks, healthy ecommerce LTV:CAC ratios typically range 3:1 to 8:1, so you're well-positioned for profitable growth.

Step 1 complete with revenue growth objective, new customer acquisition KPI, and 15,000 customer target. Now Step 2 Economics.

What's your average order value for new customers?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 3 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our average order value for new customers is typically around $185. New customers tend to start with smaller purchases like decorative accessories or single furniture pieces before they build trust with our brand and make larger purchases later on.

AGENT:
Perfect. With $185 AOV and $450 LTV, that implies 2.4 purchases per customer over their lifetime. Based on Knowledge Base benchmarks, healthy ecommerce repeat purchase rates typically range 20-40%, so your customer retention looks solid.

Your economics check out: $50 CAC against $450 LTV gives you 9x return. This target is achievable.

Step 2 complete. Your efficiency target is realistic based on strong unit economics.

Who is your ideal customer for these home decor purchases?

Events: benchmark_cited, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 4 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our ideal customer is typically a homeowner between 30-55 years old, usually women, with household income of $60K and above who are interested in refreshing their living spaces. They tend to be busy professionals or parents who value quality and style but also appreciate convenience of online shopping. We see a lot of engagement from people who have recently moved, are renovating, or just want to update their home's look for the seasons.

AGENT:
Your targeting is precise and well-defined. Based on Knowledge Base, homeowners 30-55 with household income $60K+ interested in home decor reaches approximately 2.1M people nationally. That's excellent scale for your 15,000 customer target.

What geographic markets are you focusing on - national, specific regions, or metro areas?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 5 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're primarily focused on the US market, mainly targeting major metropolitan areas where our customers tend to be concentrated. We see the strongest performance in cities like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, and Atlanta, but we're open to expanding into other markets if the data supports it. I'd say about 70% of our current customer base comes from the top 20 metro areas, so that's been our main focus so far.

AGENT:
Smart geographic focus. Based on Knowledge Base, your target audience in top 20 DMAs is approximately 1.5M people - still excellent scale for 15,000 acquisitions without oversaturation.

Step 3 complete with homeowner audience 30-55, $60K+ income. Step 4 complete with top 20 metro focus.

With your $750K budget and 15,000 customer target, how do you want to allocate spend across the year?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 6 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We typically see stronger sales during certain seasons, so I'd want to weight our spending accordingly. I'm thinking maybe 40% of our budget during Q4 for the holiday season since that's when people are really focused on home decorating and gift-giving. Then probably 25% in Q2 for spring home refresh, and split the remaining 35% between Q1 and Q3. Does that allocation make sense based on what you're seeing in the home decor space?

AGENT:
Your seasonal allocation is spot-on. Based on Knowledge Base benchmarks, home decor typically sees 35-45% of annual sales in Q4, so your 40% weight aligns perfectly with consumer behavior patterns.

Your Q2 spring emphasis at 25% is smart - that's peak home refresh season. The remaining split gives you steady presence year-round.

What's your value proposition that differentiates HomeStyle from other home decor retailers?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 7 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our main differentiator is that we curate collections that work together seamlessly - we take the guesswork out of decorating by offering coordinated pieces that customers can mix and match with confidence. We also focus heavily on quality at accessible price points, and our customer service team includes actual interior design consultants who can provide free styling advice. I think what really sets us apart is that we make good design feel approachable rather than intimidating, especially for customers who want their homes to look professionally decorated but don't want to hire a designer.

AGENT:
Excellent value proposition - curated collections that work together is a strong differentiator. The interior design consultation adds real value and justifies premium positioning.

Step 5 complete with seasonal budget allocation. Step 6 complete with coordinated design value proposition.

Based on Knowledge Base benchmarks for home decor ecommerce, your strongest channel mix typically includes paid social for visual products, search for high-intent shoppers, and display for retargeting. With your $750K budget, we can fund 3-4 channels effectively.

What channels have you used before, and which performed best for customer acquisition?

Events: benchmark_cited, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 8 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We've primarily been using Facebook and Instagram ads, which have performed pretty well for us - the visual nature of our products really works on those platforms. We've also done some Google Ads, mainly search campaigns, and that's been our most consistent performer for driving conversions, though the volume isn't as high as social. We tried some display advertising last year but honestly didn't see great results, though I'm not sure if that was our targeting or creative that was the issue.

AGENT:
Your channel experience aligns perfectly with industry patterns. Based on Knowledge Base benchmarks, Google search typically delivers the highest conversion rates for home decor while social platforms like Facebook/Instagram excel at volume and visual engagement.

Your display struggles are common - often targeting or creative issues rather than channel viability. For home decor, display works best for retargeting website visitors.

Given your performance data, I recommend 50% search, 35% social, 15% display retargeting. This leverages your proven channels while fixing display execution.

What's your current monthly spend split between Google and Facebook/Instagram?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 9 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Right now we're spending about $35K per month total, with roughly 60% going to Facebook and Instagram and 40% to Google. So that's around $21K on social and $14K on search monthly. Your recommended split sounds like it would flip that ratio, which makes sense given what you're saying about search conversion rates. I'm definitely open to shifting more budget toward Google if that's where we'll see better efficiency.

AGENT:
Perfect insight. Based on Knowledge Base benchmarks, your current 60% social/40% search split is actually backwards for optimal efficiency. Home decor campaigns typically see search CACs 20-40% lower than social due to higher purchase intent.

With your proven $14K monthly search performance, scaling to $31K (50% of $62.5K monthly) should maintain efficiency while significantly boosting volume.

Your social channels stay strong at $22K monthly but focus on upper-funnel awareness to feed search demand.

How comfortable are you with this reallocation, and do you have capacity constraints on either platform?

Events: benchmark_cited, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 10 (Step 8)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I'm comfortable with that reallocation - it makes a lot of sense given what you're explaining about search intent being higher. We haven't really pushed our Google campaigns to their limits yet, so I think we have room to scale up there. On the social side, we've been pretty focused on direct response campaigns, so shifting more toward awareness and upper-funnel content would actually be a nice change of pace for our creative team. My only concern is making sure we can build out enough search campaigns and keywords to absorb that increased budget effectively.

AGENT:
Smart concern about search capacity. Based on Knowledge Base benchmarks, home decor campaigns can typically support 3-5x current keyword volume through expanded product categories, seasonal terms, and long-tail variations. Your current $14K likely covers core terms - scaling to $31K opens room for broader match types and shopping campaigns.

Step 7 complete with 50% search, 35% social, 15% display allocation.

For measurement, what's most important - tracking individual channel performance, overall ROAS, or customer lifetime value?

Events: benchmark_cited, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 11 (Step 10)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Customer lifetime value is definitely the most important metric for us since we're focused on building long-term relationships, but I also need to track individual channel performance to understand what's working and optimize our spend. We've been primarily looking at ROAS up to this point, but I know that doesn't tell the whole story about customer quality. I'd love to get better at measuring LTV by channel so we can make smarter budget allocation decisions.

AGENT:
Perfect focus on LTV measurement. Based on Knowledge Base, successful home decor campaigns track LTV by channel using 90-day cohort analysis. This reveals which channels attract repeat buyers versus one-time customers.

Recommended measurement framework: 7-day click attribution for immediate ROAS, plus 90-day LTV cohorts by channel. Search typically shows 20-30% higher LTV due to purchase intent, while social excels at customer volume.

Step 8 complete with LTV-focused measurement approach.

What testing priorities matter most - creative variations, audience segments, or budget allocation experiments?

Events: benchmark_cited, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 12 (Step 10)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I'd say creative variations are probably our biggest priority right now. We've been using similar ad creative for a while, and I think we're starting to see some fatigue, especially on the social side. Given that we're planning to shift more toward upper-funnel awareness campaigns, we'll need fresh creative that really showcases our curated collections and design consultation value prop. Audience testing would be my second priority - I'd love to explore some lookalike audiences and maybe test expanding beyond our core 30-55 demographic to see if we can find new customer segments.

AGENT:
Excellent priorities. Based on Knowledge Base, creative testing is critical for home decor where visual appeal drives engagement. Recommend testing 4-6 creative variants monthly, focusing on lifestyle imagery showcasing your curated collections.

For audience expansion, lookalike testing typically yields 15-25% efficiency gains when based on high-LTV customer segments.

Step 9 complete with creative-first testing approach.

What's your biggest concern that could derail this plan?
