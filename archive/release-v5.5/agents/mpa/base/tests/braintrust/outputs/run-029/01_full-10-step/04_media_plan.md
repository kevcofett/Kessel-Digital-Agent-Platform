# Media Plan Output: Full 10-Step Media Planning

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You mentioned acquiring 15,000 new customers - that's a clear volume target. What's the primary business outcome you're trying to achieve with these acquisitions?

Turn 2:
Perfect. Step 1 complete with Objective: Revenue growth through customer acquisition, KPI: New customers, Target: 15,000 customers. Now Step 2 Economics.

With your $750K budget and 15,000 customer target, that's $50 per customer acquisition. Based on Knowledge Base, typical ecommerce CAC is $20-80, so your target sits in the middle-to-upper range - achievable but requires solid execution.

What's your average customer value in the first purchase?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Great - $120 first purchase with $50 CAC gives you 2.4x immediate ROAS. Based on Knowledge Base, healthy ecommerce typically targets 3:1 LTV:CAC ratios, so your efficiency depends on repeat purchases.

Step 2 complete. Your $50 CAC target is achievable with strong repeat behavior.

Now Step 3 Audience. You mentioned customers who update regularly - what triggers someone to refresh their home decor?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Good demographics start. With your $50 CAC target (aggressive for home goods), we need precise targeting across all dimensions.

You mentioned life triggers - moving, marriage, kids, seasonal refresh. These behavioral signals are gold for efficiency. Based on Knowledge Base, behavioral targeting typically improves conversion 40-60% over demographics alone.

What content do these customers consume - HGTV, Pinterest, home design blogs, Instagram accounts?

Turn 5:
Excellent contextual signals - Pinterest and Instagram for inspiration, HGTV for aspirational content, YouTube for tutorials. This lifestyle-driven consumption pattern is perfect for home decor targeting.

With your $50 CAC target (aggressive for home goods), we need tight targeting across all dimensions. Based on Knowledge Base, aggressive efficiency requires 20-40 targeting signals with 5-15% market penetration.

What's your primary geography - national, top markets, or specific regions?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Perfect - focusing on top metro markets where your performance is strongest makes sense for efficiency.

Here's your audience breakdown by market:

| Metro Area | Population | Target Audience | Target % |
|------------|------------|----------------|----------|
| New York | 8.3M | 245K | 2.9% |
| Los Angeles | 4.0M | 118K | 2.9% |
| Chicago | 2.7M | 80K | 2.9% |
| Dallas | 2.6M | 77K | 2.9% |
| Atlanta | 2.0M | 59K | 2.9% |
| Other Top 5 | 5.4M | 159K | 2.9% |
| **TOTAL** | **25.0M** | **738K** | **2.9%** |

Based on Knowledge Base, your target audience in top 10 metros is approximately 738K people. With 15,000 customer target, you need 2% market penetration - ambitious but achievable with your behavioral triggers.

Your $750K budget works out to roughly $1.02 per person in your addressable market - solid investment density for home decor.

What's your ideal budget allocation across the year?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Smart seasonal thinking. Based on Knowledge Base, Q4 CPMs run 30-60% higher due to holiday competition, so your 40% allocation ($300K) needs extra efficiency planning.

Here's what that means: Your Q4 $50 CAC target becomes $75-80 effective CAC due to premium pricing. Your spring Q2 allocation benefits from moderate CPMs, making that $50 target more achievable.

Consider front-loading Q1 when CPMs are lowest (20-30% below average) - those customers have full-year repeat value.

What's your core value proposition that differentiates you from other home decor retailers?

Turn 8:
Excellent positioning - "affordable designer looks" with curated collections addresses a real market gap. Based on Knowledge Base, quality-focused value propositions typically improve customer lifetime value 15-25% versus pure discount positioning.

Step 5 complete. Your curated collections approach should attract higher-LTV customers who value style guidance over just low prices.

Smart seasonal rebalancing too - Q1's 20-30% lower CPMs mean your $50 CAC becomes $35-40 effective, perfect for building your base early.

What channels have worked best for you historically, or are you starting fresh?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Perfect - you've found your strength with Meta's lifestyle targeting. Based on Knowledge Base, home decor performs best when combining behavioral triggers with contextual signals.

Your channel foundation: Meta (proven), Pinterest (organic success suggests paid potential), Google (needs optimization). With your $50 CAC target, channel mix becomes critical - shifting budget toward your best-performing channels can improve efficiency 5-15%.

Pinterest paid makes sense given your organic success and behavioral triggers (seasonal refresh, life changes). Google needs keyword refinement - focus on "living room decor ideas" versus "furniture."

Which channels are you most interested in testing beyond your current three?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 10:
Perfect channel thinking. Based on Knowledge Base, your testing priorities should focus on efficiency and scalability with your $750K budget.

**Recommended test channels:**
1. **Pinterest paid** - Your organic success suggests strong audience fit. Minimum $15K monthly needed for optimization.
2. **YouTube pre-roll** - Targets home renovation content viewers. Room makeover videos align perfectly with your triggers.
3. **Connected TV** - Reaches homeowners but needs $25-50K monthly minimum for impact.

With your budget, I'd test Pinterest first ($45K quarterly) and YouTube second ($30K quarterly). CTV requires bigger commitment.

How do you currently measure success beyond just new customer acquisition?

Turn 11:
Based on Knowledge Base, your measurement gaps are costing efficiency. You're missing customer lifetime value tracking and channel attribution - critical for optimizing your $50 CAC target.

**Essential upgrades:**
1. **Customer LTV tracking** - 80% of value comes from repeat purchases
2. **New vs. repeat attribution** - Prevents overspending on existing customers  
3. **Channel-level LTV analysis** - Some channels attract higher-value customers

Your repeat purchase focus is smart - Based on Knowledge Base, optimizing for transaction volume without new customer distinction often inflates costs 2-3x.

What's your current repeat purchase rate within 6 months?

Turn 12:
Excellent baseline! Your 35-40% repeat rate is solid. Based on Knowledge Base, ecommerce repeat rates vary by segment, with home goods typically seeing 30-50% within 6 months.

With $120 first purchase and 35% repeat rate, your customer LTV is roughly $200-250 over 12 months. Your $50 CAC gives you 4-5x LTV:CAC ratio - healthy foundation.

Step 8 complete. Channel-level LTV tracking will reveal which sources drive your best repeaters, letting you shift budget toward quality over volume.

What's your biggest concern or risk with this media plan?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 10: Risks

Turn 13:
Valid concerns. Based on Knowledge Base, execution bandwidth is the #1 risk for scaling campaigns - spreading too thin reduces optimization quality across all channels.

**Risk mitigation:**
- **Phase rollout** - Start with Meta/Pinterest (proven), add YouTube Q2
- **Q4 hedge** - Reserve 15% budget contingency for CPM spikes  
- **CAC safety net** - Your 4-5x LTV:CAC ratio gives cushion if costs rise to $60-65

Your $50 CAC is ambitious but achievable. Based on Knowledge Base, channel mix optimization alone can improve efficiency 10-15%. Focus budget on your best-performing channels first.
