# Media Plan Output: Full 10-Step Media Planning

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Your $50 CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) target is realistic - Based on Knowledge Base, typical ecommerce CAC is $20-80. You're right in the middle of the range, which gives us good flexibility for channel selection.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 15,000 new customers?

Turn 2:
Excellent economics! Your 9:1 LTV:CAC ratio ($450 LTV / $50 CAC) is strong. Based on Knowledge Base, ecommerce typically targets 3:1 minimum, so you have healthy margin for efficiency fluctuations.

Step 1 complete with Objective: sustainable growth, KPI: new customer acquisition, Target: 15,000 customers at $50 CAC. Now Step 2 Economics.

With your 35% profit margins and $180 AOV, what's your maximum acceptable CAC before it impacts profitability targets?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it, I'll model using $50 CAC with $70 ceiling for efficiency guardrails. Based on Knowledge Base, typical ecommerce CAC is $20-80, so your target is achievable. You can adjust anytime.

Step 2 complete. Your $50 target is realistic with good upside protection.

Now let's define your ideal customer. Beyond demographics, what specific behaviors or triggers indicate someone is ready to purchase home decor?

Turn 4:
Perfect behavioral triggers - life events and design inspiration browsing are strong purchase predictors. Based on Knowledge Base, home decorating enthusiasts and recent home buyers audience in US national is approximately 2.1M.

With your $50 CAC target, this size allows sustainable reach without quick saturation. The precision should drive good conversion rates, though CPMs may run higher due to competitive targeting.

What geographic markets are you prioritizing - national reach or specific regions where HomeStyle performs strongest?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
With 15,000 customers needed, I recommend top 10 DMAs approach. Based on Knowledge Base, home decorating enthusiasts and recent home buyers audience in top 10 DMAs is approximately 2.1M - giving you 140:1 audience-to-target ratio, which prevents quick saturation.

Here's the audience sizing for your priority markets:

| DMA | Population | Target Audience | Target % |
|-----|------------|----------------|----------|
| New York | 8.3M | 185K | 2.2% |
| Los Angeles | 4.0M | 89K | 2.2% |
| Chicago | 3.2M | 71K | 2.2% |
| Atlanta | 2.4M | 53K | 2.2% |
| Philadelphia | 2.9M | 64K | 2.2% |
| Dallas | 2.8M | 62K | 2.2% |
| Washington DC | 2.4M | 53K | 2.2% |
| Boston | 2.4M | 53K | 2.2% |
| San Francisco | 2.3M | 51K | 2.2% |
| Houston | 2.7M | 60K | 2.2% |
| **TOTAL** | **31.4M** | **741K** | **2.4%** |

This concentration captures your highest-value markets while maintaining efficient reach. Does this geographic focus align with your growth strategy?

Turn 6:
Perfect! Step 4 complete with top 10 DMAs and 741K target audience.

Now Step 5 Budget. With your $750K budget across these markets, that's roughly $50 per target person in your audience - giving you excellent reach frequency. Based on Knowledge Base, ecommerce typically needs minimum $5-15K monthly per channel to optimize effectively.

Your budget supports 3-4 channels well, or 5-6 if we include lower-spend tactical channels. What's your current thinking on budget allocation - equal distribution or concentrating spend in proven channels?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Smart approach! For home decor with design-focused audiences, I recommend concentrating in visual platforms. Based on Knowledge Base, Meta typically delivers $20-40 lower CAC than display channels for ecommerce.

Here's my recommended allocation for your $750K:

**Primary Channels (80% - $600K):**
- Meta (Facebook/Instagram): $400K - captures design inspiration browsers
- Pinterest: $200K - natural home decor discovery platform

**Secondary Channels (20% - $150K):**
- Google Search: $100K - high-intent "home decor" searches  
- Google Shopping: $50K - product discovery

This gives each channel $50K+ monthly for proper optimization. Meta's visual format aligns perfectly with your Pinterest-browsing audience, while Google captures direct intent.

What's your experience been with Pinterest advertising, and are there any channels you'd prefer to avoid?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
Excellent allocation! Step 5 complete with $400K Meta, $200K Pinterest, $100K Google Search, $50K Google Shopping.

Now Step 6 Value Proposition. Based on Knowledge Base, home decor customers optimize for long-term value, not just volume. Your $450 LTV suggests repeat purchasers are critical to profitability.

What key benefits differentiate HomeStyle from competitors - unique styles, quality, pricing, or customer experience?

Turn 9:
Perfect differentiation strategy! Your curated design approach and cohesive styling service creates strong competitive moats. Based on Knowledge Base, optimizing for customers likely to deliver long-term value rather than maximum volume drives better economics - your $450 LTV validates this approach.

Step 6 complete with unique curation, accessible luxury positioning, and experience differentiation.

Now Step 7 Channels. Your Meta/Pinterest visual focus captures design inspiration perfectly. With Pinterest's discovery mindset and Meta's targeting precision, this mix should deliver quality customers who appreciate curated styles rather than discount shoppers.

How will you measure success beyond just conversion volume - repeat purchase rates, AOV growth, or customer satisfaction metrics?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 10:
Excellent measurement strategy! Your 40% six-month repeat rate target is ambitious - Based on Knowledge Base, tracking new customer percentage alongside repeat behavior prevents optimizing for existing customers who inflate attribution.

Step 7 complete with comprehensive measurement: repeat purchase rates, AOV growth, NPS, and engagement tracking.

Now Step 8 Testing. With your $750K budget, I recommend 80/20 allocation - 80% to proven Meta/Pinterest, 20% for testing. Your room inspiration engagement correlation suggests testing video content formats and Pinterest Idea Pins could unlock higher-value customers.

What's your biggest uncertainty about this plan that we should test first?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 11:
Smart concerns! Based on Knowledge Base, Pinterest typically delivers 20-30% lower conversion rates than Meta but compensates with 15-25% lower CPMs, often reaching similar CAC efficiency. Your $50 target is achievable if Pinterest CVR hits 1.8%+.

Step 8 complete. I recommend testing Pinterest with 20% budget first ($40K monthly), then scale based on performance. For creative testing, video content showing room transformations typically lifts engagement 35-50% over static images.

Final step - what's your biggest risk concern: budget overruns, timeline delays, or efficiency targets?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 10: Risks

Turn 12:
Solid concern! Based on Knowledge Base, efficiency risk mitigation uses three levers: channel mix optimization, creative performance, and landing page optimization. Your multi-channel approach actually reduces risk - if Pinterest underperforms, you can reallocate to proven Meta channels.

**Risk Mitigation Strategy:**
- Start Pinterest at 20% budget ($150K), scale based on 30-day performance
- Build 10% efficiency buffer into each channel (target $45 CAC, not $50)
- Monthly reallocation between channels based on performance

Your $70 CAC ceiling gives 40% efficiency cushion. Even if one channel runs 25% over target, others can compensate.

Step 10 complete! You have a solid plan with built-in risk management. Ready to launch?
