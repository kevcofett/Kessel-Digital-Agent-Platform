# Media Plan Output: Full 10-Step Media Planning

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Perfect - with your $750K budget targeting 15,000 customers, that's $50 CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost). Based on Knowledge Base, typical ecommerce CAC is $20-80, so your target sits right in the sweet spot.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve - new customer growth, revenue increase, or market expansion?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Step 1 complete with Objective: new customer acquisition, KPI: customers acquired, Target: 15,000 customers.

Now Step 2 Economics. Your $50 CAC target is realistic for ecommerce. Based on Knowledge Base, typical ecommerce conversion rates are 2-3%, and successful campaigns maintain healthy LTV:CAC ratios of 3:1 or better.

What's your average customer lifetime value or average order value to validate this efficiency target?

Turn 3:
Excellent! Your $450 LTV against $50 CAC gives you a 9:1 ratio - that's very strong. Based on Knowledge Base, typical ecommerce LTV:CAC ratios vary by segment, but 3:1 is considered healthy. Your 9:1 provides substantial margin for testing and scaling.

Step 2 complete. Your $50 CAC target is achievable and well-supported by your unit economics.

Now Step 3 Audience. For home decor, successful targeting goes beyond demographics. Who is your ideal customer - are they homeowners, renters, specific life stages, or driven by particular purchase triggers like moving or redecorating?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Great foundation! You have strong demographic and behavioral signals. Based on Knowledge Base, successful home decor targeting requires all four dimensions to hit your $50 CAC target.

You've covered:
✓ Demographic: Homeowners 30-55, $75K+ income  
✓ Behavioral: Seasonal, renovation, life event triggers

For contextual signals - where do these customers spend time online? Do they follow home design influencers, browse Pinterest, watch HGTV content, or read specific lifestyle publications?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Perfect! You now have all four dimensions - demographics, behavioral triggers, contextual signals (Pinterest, Instagram, HGTV content), plus your visual/inspiration-focused interests.

Based on Knowledge Base, homeowners aged 30-55 with household income $75K+ interested in home decor and design audience in US national is approximately 2.1M. With your $50 CAC target, this precision should drive strong conversion while maintaining reasonable CPMs across visual platforms.

Now Step 4 Geography. Are you planning national reach, or should we focus on specific markets where shipping costs and competition favor your expansion goals?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Perfect strategy! Focusing your $750K across five priority markets gives you meaningful presence rather than thin national coverage.

Based on Knowledge Base, budget allocation by DMA should weight by opportunity and shipping efficiency. Here's a recommended allocation:

**New York**: $225K (30%) - largest audience, premium market  
**Los Angeles**: $165K (22%) - strong visual culture fit  
**Chicago**: $135K (18%) - efficient middle market  
**Dallas**: $120K (16%) - growing opportunity  
**Atlanta**: $105K (14%) - emerging market

This gives each DMA $15-37 per target customer for efficient acquisition within your logistics footprint.

Step 4 complete. Now Step 5 Budget - should we allocate any budget for seasonal peaks like spring home refresh or holiday decorating?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 6:
Smart approach! Focusing on established logistics markets first maximizes your efficiency. Based on Knowledge Base, your target audience in top 10 DMAs is approximately 2.1M, giving you substantial reach within your priority markets.

| DMA | Population | Target Audience | Target % |
|-----|------------|----------------|----------|
| New York | 8.3M | 245K | 2.9% |
| Los Angeles | 4.0M | 118K | 2.9% |
| Chicago | 3.2M | 94K | 2.9% |
| Dallas | 2.6M | 77K | 2.9% |
| Atlanta | 2.4M | 71K | 2.9% |
| **TOTAL** | **20.5M** | **605K** | **2.9%** |

With 15,000 customer target from 605K prospects, that's 2.5% conversion needed - very achievable for well-targeted home decor campaigns.

Should we allocate your $750K budget across these five priority markets, or add more DMAs to reach the full 2.1M audience?

Turn 8:
Smart seasonal planning! Based on Knowledge Base, home decor campaigns benefit significantly from seasonal concentration. Here's your seasonal allocation:

**Spring Peak** (Mar-May): $225K (30% of budget)  
**Holiday Peak** (Oct-Dec): $150K (20% of budget)  
**Steady State** (Jan-Feb, Jun-Sep): $375K (50% of budget)

This weights 40% toward peak seasons as requested. Spring gets the larger allocation since that's your strongest renovation/refresh period. Watch Q4 - CPMs typically run 20-30% higher during holiday season, so your $50 CAC will need extra efficiency.

Step 5 complete. Now Step 6 Value Proposition - what key message differentiates HomeStyle Decor from competitors in these visual-heavy channels?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 9:
Excellent value proposition! "Effortless style" with curated collections perfectly matches your visual platform strategy. Based on Knowledge Base, home decor campaigns succeed by emphasizing lifestyle transformation over product features.

Your positioning between mass market and high-end with designer inspiration hits the sweet spot for your $75K+ income audience. The complete room solutions angle reduces decision paralysis - crucial for conversion on visual platforms like Pinterest and Instagram.

Step 6 complete. Now Step 7 Channels - with your visual audience and curated collections message, which platforms are you currently using, and are there any you want to avoid or definitely include?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 10:
Perfect channel alignment! Your visual-first approach matches your audience perfectly. Based on Knowledge Base, home decor campaigns succeed on platforms that showcase lifestyle transformation.

Here's your optimal channel mix for $750K:

**Pinterest** (35% - $262K): Primary visual discovery, highest intent for home decor  
**Instagram** (30% - $225K): Stories/Reels for styling tips, influencer partnerships  
**Facebook** (25% - $188K): Retargeting and lookalikes from current customers  
**TikTok** (10% - $75K): Test influencer content, younger homeowner segment

This prioritizes visual platforms where your curated collections message resonates. Pinterest and Instagram together get 65% since they align perfectly with your audience's inspiration-seeking behavior.

Step 7 complete. Now Step 8 Measurement - what attribution window works for your customer journey from inspiration to purchase?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 10: Risks

Turn 11:
Perfect understanding of your customer journey! 30-day attribution captures your considered purchase cycle well. Based on Knowledge Base, home decor and furniture campaigns benefit from longer attribution windows due to research and decision time.

Your measurement framework:
- **Primary KPI**: New customers acquired (15,000 target)
- **Attribution**: 30-day view-through, 7-day click-through  
- **Platform tracking**: Pinterest (strong visual attribution), Instagram/Facebook (unified tracking), TikTok (view-through emphasis)
- **Triangulation**: Monthly incrementality tests to validate true lift beyond baseline

Step 8 complete. Now Step 9 Testing - with your $750K budget, what would you most want to test first: audience segments, creative approaches, or seasonal timing strategies?
