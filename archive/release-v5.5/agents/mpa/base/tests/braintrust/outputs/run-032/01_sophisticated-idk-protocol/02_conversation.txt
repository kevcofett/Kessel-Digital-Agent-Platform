Hey, I'm the growth lead at QuickSend. We're a remittance fintech looking to acquire 10,000 new users this quarter with a $500K media spend. Let's build out the media strategy.

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You mentioned acquiring 10,000 new users this quarter - that's a clear volume target. What's the primary business outcome you're trying to achieve beyond user acquisition (revenue growth, market share expansion, geographic expansion, etc.)?

USER:
Our primary goal is revenue growth, specifically increasing our average transaction volume. We're seeing good initial traction in the US remittance market, and we want to capitalize on that momentum by driving more high-value transactions through our platform.

AGENT:
Perfect - revenue growth through higher transaction volume is your objective, with user acquisition as the KPI targeting 10,000 new users. 

With your $500K budget targeting 10,000 users, that's $50 per user acquisition. My estimate for fintech CAC typically ranges $80-150, so your target is aggressive but achievable with tight execution.

What's your target timeline to hit these 10,000 users - is this spread across the full quarter or do you need them by a specific date?
