# Media Plan Output: Brand Building with Limited Data

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You mentioned building brand awareness for your West Coast launch with a $500K budget. To start Step 1, I need to understand your specific objective. When you say "brand awareness," what does success look like - are you targeting a certain number of people reached, website visits, or something else measurable?

Turn 2:
Perfect - Step 1 complete with Objective: brand awareness, KPI: reach 500K unique people, Target: 50K website visits. Now Step 2 Economics.

With your $500K budget targeting 500K reach, that's $1.00 per person reached. My estimate for wellness brand awareness campaigns is $8-15 CPMs, which would deliver 33-62 million impressions. At typical frequency of 3-5 exposures per person, this supports your 500K reach target.

However, your secondary goal of 50K website visits implies a 10% click-through rate from reached audience - this is extremely aggressive for brand awareness campaigns which typically see 0.5-2% engagement rates.

Should we adjust the website visit target to be more realistic, or do you want to allocate part of the budget specifically for driving traffic?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Exactly right - 10-15K website visits is much more realistic. My estimate for wellness brand awareness campaigns is 1-3% engagement rate from reached audience, so 15K visits from 500K reach (3% rate) is aggressive but achievable with strong creative and targeting.

Step 2 complete. Your $1.00 cost per person reached is conservative and achievable for wellness brands.

Now Step 3 Audience. You mentioned health-conscious millennials, but successful campaigns need more precision. Beyond age and health interest, what specific behaviors or life moments trigger supplement purchases for your ideal customers?

Turn 4:
Excellent - you've defined behavioral triggers like career stress, immunity needs, and life transitions. This targeting precision will significantly improve efficiency over demographics alone.

Based on Knowledge Base, health-conscious millennials in California, Oregon, and Washington represent approximately 6.0% of the population. With your $65 CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) target and behavioral focus on stress/energy/immunity triggers, this precision should drive strong conversion but watch for higher CPMs due to competitive wellness category.

Now Step 4 Geography. Which specific metro areas within CA/OR/WA should we prioritize - are you thinking major cities like LA, SF, Seattle, or broader state coverage?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Perfect metro selection - these four DMAs concentrate your target audience efficiently. Here's the sizing breakdown:

| DMA | Total Population | Target Audience | Target % |
|-----|------------------|-----------------|----------|
| Los Angeles | 13.2M | 792K | 6.0% |
| San Francisco | 4.7M | 282K | 6.0% |
| Seattle | 4.0M | 240K | 6.0% |
| Portland | 2.5M | 150K | 6.0% |
| **TOTAL** | **24.4M** | **1.46M** | **6.0%** |

Based on Knowledge Base, health-conscious millennials represent approximately 6.0% of metro populations. Your target of 500K reach represents 34% of the 1.46M available audience - this gives excellent scale opportunity while maintaining targeting precision.

With $500K budget across 1.46M target audience, you have $0.34 spend per target person, which supports multiple touchpoints for effective brand building.

Ready for Step 5 Budget allocation across these four metros?

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Your proportional allocation is smart - it maximizes reach by weighting toward audience concentration. Here's the breakdown:

**BUDGET ALLOCATION:**
- Los Angeles: $200K (40%) → 317K target audience
- San Francisco: $125K (25%) → 282K target audience  
- Seattle: $100K (20%) → 240K target audience
- Portland: $75K (15%) → 150K target audience

Based on Knowledge Base, proportional allocation by audience size typically optimizes reach efficiency. However, watch for market-specific CPM differences - LA and SF often run 15-25% higher than Seattle/Portland due to competition.

Step 5 complete with proportional geographic allocation. Now Step 6 Value Proposition.

What's your core message for health-conscious millennials - are you positioning as premium natural quality, convenient wellness solutions, or something else that differentiates you from other supplement brands?

Turn 7:
Excellent positioning - "partner in proactive, intelligent health management" resonates strongly with professional millennials. Based on Knowledge Base, wellness brands that emphasize scientific backing and lifestyle integration outperform pure premium or convenience messaging by 15-25% in consideration metrics.

Your holistic approach allows flexible creative testing - stress management angles for career-focused audiences, performance optimization for fitness-oriented segments, and immune support for health-conscious parents.

Step 6 complete with differentiated value proposition focused on intelligent wellness partnership.

Now Step 7 Channels. For brand awareness with your $500K budget, we need reach-efficient channels. Given your target audience of health-conscious millennials and "intelligent wellness" positioning, which channels feel most aligned with where your audience discovers new brands?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Perfect channel selection - Instagram and podcasts align strongly with health-conscious millennials. Based on Knowledge Base, Instagram CPMs for wellness brands typically run $8-15, while podcast advertising often delivers strong engagement for this demographic.

Here's my recommended split:
- **Instagram**: 60% ($300K) - Visual storytelling for scientific approach, lifestyle integration content
- **Podcasts**: 40% ($200K) - Authentic, educational content in health/wellness shows

Instagram's visual format showcases your products and scientific backing effectively, while podcasts provide the authentic, informative environment your audience trusts for wellness discovery.

Step 7 complete with Instagram/podcast channel mix optimized for intelligent wellness positioning.

Now Step 8 Measurement. For brand awareness, we need both reach metrics and engagement indicators. What tracking capabilities do you have - website analytics, brand lift studies, or other measurement tools?
