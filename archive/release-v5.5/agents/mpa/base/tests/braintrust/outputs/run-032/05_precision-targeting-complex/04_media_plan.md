# Media Plan Output: Precision Targeting with Complex Attributes

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a precision media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've provided excellent context - targeting HNW individuals with $1M+ investable assets for wealth management, with a $1.5M budget targeting 2,500 qualified leads. That's $600 per lead, which positions you well in the financial services space.

For Step 1 Outcomes, I need to clarify your primary KPI (Key Performance Indicator). When you say "qualified leads," what specific action defines qualification - is it completing a consultation request form, scheduling a discovery call, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect. Step 1 complete with Objective: Acquire HNW individuals, KPI: Qualified consultation requests (SQLs), Target: 2,500 leads.

Now Step 2 Economics. With your $1.5M budget targeting 2,500 SQLs, that's $600 per qualified lead. My estimate for wealth management SQL costs typically ranges $400-800, so your target sits right in the sweet spot - aggressive enough to drive efficiency but realistic for HNW targeting.

Your 50K client CRM data is valuable for lookalike modeling and will help optimize toward higher-converting profiles.

What's your typical SQL-to-client conversion rate from consultation requests?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent. Step 2 complete. Your $600 SQL target is realistic - with 15-20% conversion to $5-7M AUM clients, your economics are strong. My estimate suggests wealth management LTV:CAC ratios should exceed 10:1, and you're well positioned there.

Your CRM advantage is significant - lookalike modeling from 50K clients will dramatically improve targeting precision versus cold prospecting.

Now Step 3 Audience. You've defined demographics (45-65, executives/business owners, $1M+ assets) and behavioral triggers (tax optimization, estate planning research). To maximize your CRM data advantage, what specific life events or business milestones do your highest-converting clients typically experience before engaging - business sale, IPO, inheritance, or retirement transition?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Perfect - post-liquidity event targeting is your strongest angle. Business sales (40%), IPOs, and inheritance create urgent tax optimization needs exactly when they're researching.

Step 3 complete. Your four-dimensional audience is well-defined: Demographics (45-65, $1M+ assets), Behavioral (post-liquidity events, tax research), Contextual (estate planning content), Geographic (top 10 HNW DMAs).

Now Step 4 Geography. Based on Knowledge Base, your HNW post-liquidity audience in the top 10 DMAs represents approximately 6.0% of the total population. Here's the market sizing:

| DMA | Population | Target Audience | Target % |
|-----|------------|----------------|----------|
| New York | 20.1M | 1,206K | 6.0% |
| Los Angeles | 13.2M | 792K | 6.0% |
| Chicago | 9.6M | 576K | 6.0% |
| San Francisco | 7.8M | 468K | 6.0% |
| Dallas | 7.4M | 444K | 6.0% |
| Boston | 4.9M | 294K | 6.0% |
| DC | 6.3M | 378K | 6.0% |
| Miami | 6.1M | 366K | 6.0% |
| Seattle | 4.0M | 240K | 6.0% |
| Denver | 2.9M | 174K | 6.0% |
| **TOTAL** | **82.3M** | **4,938K** | **6.0%** |

With nearly 5M target audience across these markets, your 2,500 lead target represents 0.05% conversion - very achievable with precision targeting.

Should we weight spend by market wealth concentration, or do you have specific DMA priorities?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Perfect. Step 4 complete with geographic prioritization: 50% budget to SF/NYC/LA markets focusing on tech liquidity events.

Now Step 5 Budget. Based on Knowledge Base, wealth management campaigns benefit from market-weighted allocation. Here's my recommendation:

**TIER 1 MARKETS (50% = $750K)**
- San Francisco: $300K (20%) - Tech ecosystem focus
- New York: $250K (17%) - Financial center concentration  
- Los Angeles: $200K (13%) - Entertainment/tech wealth

**TIER 2 MARKETS (35% = $525K)**
- Chicago: $125K, Boston: $100K, Seattle: $100K, DC: $100K, Dallas: $100K

**TIER 3 MARKETS (15% = $225K)**
- Miami: $125K, Denver: $100K

This weighting aligns spend with both HNW concentration and your CRM data showing higher-value clients from Tier 1 markets. SF gets the largest allocation given your tech liquidity event focus.

Does this geographic budget allocation align with your market priorities?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 6:
Excellent. Step 5 complete with geographic budget allocation approved.

Now Step 6 Value Proposition. Based on Knowledge Base, wealth management campaigns succeed by targeting quality over volume - exactly your approach. With post-liquidity events creating urgent tax optimization needs, your messaging should emphasize specialized expertise in complex tax strategies.

Your value proposition likely centers on: "Specialized wealth management for post-liquidity executives with proven expertise in complex tax optimization and estate planning." Your CRM data showing 6-18 month research cycles suggests educational content positioning you as the expert during their evaluation phase.

What's your core differentiator versus other wealth management firms targeting the same HNW post-liquidity audience?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 7:
Perfect. Step 6 complete with your proprietary tax optimization framework as the core differentiator - targeting tech founders with specialized expertise in stock options, R&D credits, and strategic charitable giving.

Now Step 7 Channels. Based on Knowledge Base, wealth management campaigns require precision targeting over broad reach. For your HNW post-liquidity audience, I recommend:

**PRIMARY CHANNELS (70% = $1.05M)**
- LinkedIn Sponsored Content: $525K (35%) - Executive targeting with first-party lookalikes
- Programmatic Display: $315K (21%) - Financial publication targeting
- Google Search: $210K (14%) - Tax optimization keywords

**SECONDARY CHANNELS (30% = $450K)**
- Connected TV: $225K (15%) - Premium inventory in target DMAs
- Native Content: $135K (9%) - Educational content syndication
- Direct Mail: $90K (6%) - Ultra-targeted HNW lists

This mix leverages your CRM data for precision lookalike modeling while maintaining educational content presence during their 6-18 month research cycle.

Does this channel allocation align with your precision-over-volume approach?
