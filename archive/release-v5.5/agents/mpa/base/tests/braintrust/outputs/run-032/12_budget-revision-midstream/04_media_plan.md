# Media Plan Output: Budget Revision Midstream

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Your $50 CAC target is aggressive. Based on Knowledge Base, typical SaaS CAC is $100. This means you'll need exceptional targeting precision and conversion optimization.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 10,000 new customers?

Turn 2:
Perfect. Step 1 complete with Objective: expand mid-market share, KPI: new customer acquisition, Target: 10,000 customers.

Your economics look strong. Based on Knowledge Base, SaaS LTV:CAC ratios typically range 3:1 to 5:1. Your $2,400:$50 ratio is 48:1, which gives massive efficiency headroom even if actual CAC runs higher.

Step 2 complete. Your $50 target is aggressive but achievable given your LTV cushion.

Who exactly are you targeting within these 100-1000 employee companies?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Great targeting - operations/analytics leaders at mid-market companies have strong purchase intent for your solution. With your $50 CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost), this precision targeting is smart but will require higher CPMs due to limited inventory.

Based on Knowledge Base, B2B decision makers operations analytics leaders audience represents approximately 6% of business populations. However, your specific criteria (100-1000 employees, tech/finance/professional services) will be much smaller.

What geographic markets are you prioritizing for this expansion?

Turn 5:
Perfect. Step 4 complete with focused US/Canada markets covering 3.25M prospects. Your 0.31% conversion target is realistic for this precision targeting.

Based on Knowledge Base, B2B SaaS typically allocates 30-40% lower funnel (search, retargeting), 20-30% mid funnel (content, social), and 30-40% upper funnel (awareness channels). With your $50 CAC target and precise audience, you'll need efficiency-focused allocation.

With your $500K budget and 10,000 customer target, how much flexibility do you have if we need to adjust the budget upward?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Based on Knowledge Base, your target audience in US and Canada represents approximately 6.0% of business populations. For precise planning, we need to break this down by major markets.

Here's your target audience sizing by key DMAs:

| DMA | Total Population | Target Audience | Target % |
|-----|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| New York | 20.1M | 1.21M | 6.0% |
| Los Angeles | 13.2M | 792K | 6.0% |
| Chicago | 9.5M | 570K | 6.0% |
| Toronto | 6.4M | 384K | 6.0% |
| San Francisco | 4.7M | 282K | 6.0% |
| **TOTAL** | **54.9M** | **3.25M** | **6.0%** |

With 10,000 target customers from 3.25M prospects, you need 0.31% conversion rate. This is realistic for B2B SaaS with strong targeting.

Should we focus on these top 5 markets or expand to additional DMAs?

Turn 6:
Excellent! With $750K budget and 10,000 customer target, that's $75 per customer - much more realistic. Based on Knowledge Base, this gives you significant efficiency headroom and opens up more channel options.

Your new CAC target of $75 is still aggressive but achievable for B2B SaaS. This 50% budget increase means you can:
- Add upper funnel channels for brand awareness
- Test additional DMAs beyond your core 5 markets  
- Build buffer for Q4 when CPMs run 20-30% higher

What's your company's core value proposition for these operations and analytics leaders?

Turn 7:
Strong value prop - turning data burden into strategic advantage resonates perfectly with your operations/analytics leader audience. Step 6 complete with clear differentiation around real-time insights and predictive analytics.

Based on Knowledge Base, B2B SaaS efficiency targeting typically requires lower funnel focus initially, then scaling to brand channels. With your $75 CAC target, we need channel precision.

What channels have you used before, and which performed best for reaching operations leaders?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 9:
Perfect timing! ABM (Account-Based Marketing) and podcasts are smart additions for operations leaders. Based on Knowledge Base, B2B testing typically allocates 5-10% of budget for emerging channels.

For your $750K budget, I'd recommend:
- ABM test: $50K (7%) - highly targeted, perfect for your precision audience
- Podcast test: $25K (3%) - business/tech shows reach your personas during commute/downtime
- Keep search as your anchor channel (40-50% of budget)

Both channels can maintain your $75 CAC if executed well. ABM typically has higher conversion rates but smaller reach, while podcasts build awareness for future conversions.

How will you measure success across these different channels?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Good foundation - search and LinkedIn are smart for operations leaders. Based on Knowledge Base, B2B SaaS typically benefits from multi-channel approach with search as anchor.

Your search performance validates the strategy. LinkedIn's 1-2% conversion is typical for cold outreach. The programmatic display struggle is common - operations leaders respond better to intent-based channels.

For your $750K budget and precise targeting, which channels are you most curious about testing beyond your current mix?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Strong measurement approach. Based on Knowledge Base, B2B SaaS with 90-day sales cycles should use longer attribution windows - consider 90-day click, 30-day view instead of standard 30/7. Your MQL/SQL tracking is perfect for ABM pipeline velocity analysis.

Step 8 complete. For testing ABM and podcasts while protecting your $75 CAC, I recommend 30-day test windows with weekly check-ins. ABM typically shows results faster than podcasts.

What's your biggest concern about hitting the 10,000 customer target?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 11:
Valid concern. Based on Knowledge Base, B2B SaaS with your pipeline velocity needs marketing-sales alignment around MQL handoff speed and lead scoring precision. Your 60-90 day target requires immediate qualification and nurture acceleration.

Critical risks: If ABM generates high-quality accounts but sales can't close fast enough, you miss targets despite good marketing. If podcast awareness takes 120+ days to convert, it won't help this year's goal.

Step 9 complete. Your testing approach protects efficiency while sales velocity determines ultimate success.

What's your backup plan if early results show you need to adjust the 10,000 target or timeline?
