# Media Plan Output: Channel Mix Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You mentioned reaching 2 million households for awareness - that's a clear objective. What specific awareness metric will you use to measure success, and what's your target level?

Turn 2:
Perfect. Step 1 complete with Objective: brand awareness, KPI: awareness lift, Target: 25-point lift (15% to 40%). Now Step 2 Economics.

With $3M budget targeting 25-point awareness lift across 2M households, that's $1.50 per household reached. My estimate suggests this is realistic for national awareness campaigns in food/beverage, which typically require $1-3 per household for meaningful lift.

What's your target Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) or cost per trial for converting awareness into actual purchases?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it. I'll model using $10 CAC target. My estimate suggests food/beverage brands typically see $8-15 CAC for premium organic products, so your target is achievable. You can adjust anytime.

Step 2 complete. Your $10 target is realistic for organic/premium positioning.

Now let's define your audience precisely. You mentioned health-conscious families - what specific behaviors or triggers indicate someone is likely to purchase organic snacks?

Turn 4:
Excellent behavioral targeting - that precision should drive strong conversion rates. Based on Knowledge Base, health-conscious families who buy organic produce represents approximately 6.0% of US households nationally.

With your $10 CAC and premium positioning, this targeting precision is smart but creates a tradeoff: higher conversion rates but higher CPMs due to competitive demand for this audience.

What's your household income threshold - are you targeting all income levels within this health-conscious segment, or focusing on higher-income families who can afford premium pricing?

Turn 5:
Perfect targeting. Based on Knowledge Base, health-conscious families with $75K+ household income who buy organic produce represents approximately 6.0% of US households nationally. This gives you roughly 8 million households in your addressable market - well above your 2 million reach goal.

The income filter strengthens your efficiency but creates premium CPM pressure since you're competing for affluent audiences.

What geographic markets are priorities - are you launching nationally day one, or starting with specific regions or DMAs?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Based on Knowledge Base, your target audience of health-conscious families with $75K+ household income who buy organic produce represents approximately 6.0% of US households nationally. This gives you about 8 million addressable households - excellent scale for your 2 million reach goal.

| Geography | Total HH | Target Audience | Target % |
| US National | 133.4M | 8.0M | 6.0% |

Step 4 complete. Your national scope provides strong scale and aligns with retail distribution.

With $3M budget targeting 8 million households, you have $0.38 per target household. This creates healthy budget headroom for frequency and optimization. What's your campaign timeline - how many weeks or months do you need this awareness lift to build?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Perfect timing alignment. Step 5 complete with $3M budget over 3-4 months during back-to-school season.

Smart seasonal positioning - you'll capture families making new snack decisions. However, Based on Knowledge Base, CPMs typically rise 10-20% in September-October as retail advertisers compete for holiday inventory. Your $1.50 per household may face pressure in Q4.

What's your core value proposition that differentiates PureLife Organics snacks from competitors like Annie's or Plum Organics?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Excellent positioning - "purest" creates clear differentiation in crowded organic space. Step 6 complete.

Now channels. Without Meta/TikTok, Based on Knowledge Base, awareness campaigns typically allocate 60-70% to broad reach channels. For your $3M budget and awareness goal, I recommend:

- **Connected TV/Video**: $1.2M (40%) - Premium reach for health-conscious families
- **National TV**: $900K (30%) - Broad awareness during back-to-school 
- **Programmatic Display**: $600K (20%) - Retargeting and sustained presence
- **YouTube/Video**: $300K (10%) - Ingredient storytelling content

This mix maximizes reach without social platforms. Which of these channels align with your brand guidelines and measurement capabilities?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
Good to know upfront. Based on Knowledge Base, removing social media from brand awareness campaigns shifts focus to TV, Connected TV, programmatic display, and YouTube video. For your $3M budget and awareness goal, this actually strengthens reach efficiency since awareness campaigns typically allocate 60-70% to broad reach channels anyway.

Your budget headroom helps - without Meta/TikTok's premium targeting costs, you can maximize reach through video and display at lower CPMs.

What's your core value proposition that differentiates PureLife Organics snacks from competitors like Annie's or Plum Organics?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 10:
Step 7 complete with channel allocation. Now measurement.

Based on Knowledge Base, your awareness-focused channel mix requires triangulated measurement since CTV and TV are harder to attribute than digital channels. I recommend:

**Primary:** Brand lift study (pre/post awareness surveys) - directly measures your 25-point lift goal
**Secondary:** Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) - attributes awareness contribution by channel  
**Tactical:** Platform reporting for reach/frequency optimization

Challenge: TV/CTV attribution is limited, so your $10 CAC measurement will need post-campaign surveys linking awareness to trial behavior.

Do you have research capabilities in-house, or would you work with an external partner for brand lift measurement?
