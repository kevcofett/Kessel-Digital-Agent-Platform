# Media Plan Output: Geography Expansion Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've given me a strong foundation - $2.5M budget targeting 500K store visits and online conversions for active adults 25-45 in the US market. That works out to a $5 blended cost per action, which is quite efficient for retail.

To complete Step 1, I need to clarify your primary KPI (Key Performance Indicator). When you say "store visits and online conversions combined," are you optimizing for total traffic volume, actual purchases, or something else as your main success metric?

Turn 2:
Based on your math, you're projecting a $10-12 AOV (Average Order Value), which seems low for athletic apparel. Based on Knowledge Base, athletic apparel typically sees AOVs in the $60-85 range.

With your $5 CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) target and assuming a healthier $75 AOV, you'd need strong repeat purchase behavior to justify the economics. A 3:1 LTV (Lifetime Value) to CAC ratio requires each customer to generate $15 in lifetime margin.

What's your typical product price point and expected gross margin percentage?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 3:
Perfect! Your $120 AOV with 50-55% margin means $60-66 gross profit per customer. Your $5 CAC target is extremely aggressive - Based on Knowledge Base, typical retail CAC is $20-80.

With your premium positioning and margins, you have room for higher acquisition costs. At $25 CAC, you'd still achieve a healthy 2.4:1 gross LTV to CAC ratio on first purchase alone.

Step 1 complete: Drive purchases, target $5-6M revenue, aiming for 42K-50K customers. Step 2 Economics: Your $5 CAC is ambitious but your strong margins provide cushion if we need $15-20 to compete effectively in premium channels.

What's your expected customer repeat purchase rate over 12 months?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 4:
Excellent! Your 25-30% repeat rate is solid for premium athletic wear. With $120 AOV and 55% margin, here's your economics:

First purchase: $66 gross profit
Repeat customers (27.5%): Additional $66 profit
Blended LTV: $84 per customer

Your $5 CAC target creates a 17:1 LTV to CAC ratio - that's exceptional efficiency. Based on Knowledge Base, typical retail CAC is $20-80, so you have significant headroom.

Step 2 complete: Your $5 target is aggressive but achievable with your premium margins and repeat behavior.

Now Step 3 Audience: You mentioned "active adults 25-45" - that's quite broad at roughly 65 million Americans. What specific behaviors or triggers drive someone to buy premium athletic wear?

Turn 5:
Perfect targeting insight! Serious fitness enthusiasts who see gear as performance investment - that's a much tighter behavioral profile than casual gym-goers.

Based on Knowledge Base, fitness enthusiasts serious athletes premium athletic wear audience in US national is approximately 6.0% of adults, roughly 12-15 million people. This precision targeting should significantly improve your conversion rates versus broad "active adults."

With your $5 CAC target, this focused approach makes sense - you need higher conversion rates to hit that efficiency. Quality-focused athletes typically convert 2-3x better than general fitness audiences.

Which specific geographic markets are you prioritizing - national rollout or key metro areas first?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Smart metro focus! These are premium fitness markets with high disposable income. Based on Knowledge Base, here's your audience sizing:

| DMA | Population | Target Audience | Target % |
|-----|------------|-----------------|----------|
| New York | 20.1M | 1.21M | 6.0% |
| Chicago | 9.5M | 570K | 6.0% |
| San Francisco | 7.8M | 468K | 6.0% |
| Denver | 2.9M | 174K | 6.0% |
| Miami | 2.7M | 162K | 6.0% |
| **TOTAL** | **43.0M** | **2.58M** | **6.0%** |

Your 2.58M target audience across these metros gives you excellent scale. With your $2.5M budget, that's $0.97 per target person - solid reach potential.

Step 4 complete. Now Step 5 Budget: How do you want to allocate your $2.5M across these five markets?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Great expansion! Adding Canada and Mexico significantly increases your addressable market. Here's your updated sizing:

| Market | Population | Target Audience | Budget Allocation |
|--------|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| US (5 metros) | 43.0M | 2.58M | $1.75M (70%) |
| Canada | 38.2M | 2.29M | $500K (20%) |
| Mexico | 128.9M | 7.73M | $250K (10%) |
| **TOTAL** | **210.1M** | **12.6M** | **$2.5M** |

This changes your efficiency dramatically - now $0.20 per target person versus $0.97. Much better reach potential, but you'll need localized creative and potentially different channel strategies for each market.

Canada's premium fitness market aligns well with your positioning. Mexico's massive audience offers scale but may require adjusted pricing strategy.

How do you want to phase the rollout timing across these three markets?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
Excellent phased approach! Based on Knowledge Base, phased market rollouts allow optimization between phases and reduce risk. Here's your quarterly budget allocation:

**Q1 US Launch**: $1.75M across 5 metros
**Q2 Canada Expansion**: $500K 
**Q3 Mexico Test**: $250K

This structure lets you refine targeting and creative based on Q1 performance before scaling. Canada's premium market should respond well to your performance messaging, while Mexico may need adjusted positioning.

Step 5 complete with phased geographic budget allocation.

Now Step 6 Value Proposition: What's your core message differentiating ActiveWear Pro from competitors like Lululemon or Nike?

Turn 9:
Excellent positioning! "Performance technology, not fashion statement" clearly differentiates you from lifestyle brands. Based on Knowledge Base, performance-focused messaging works best when it provides specific, measurable benefits.

Your muscle recovery, temperature regulation, and movement efficiency claims need proof points in creative - lab tests, athlete testimonials, or performance data. Technical audiences respond to specifics over generic "performance" claims.

Step 6 complete: Performance engineering differentiation with measurable athletic benefits.

Now Step 7 Channels: Given your premium technical positioning and $5 CAC target, which channels are you considering for your Q1 US launch?
