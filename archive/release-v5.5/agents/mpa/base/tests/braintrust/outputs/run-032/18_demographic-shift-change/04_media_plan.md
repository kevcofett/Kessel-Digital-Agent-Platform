# Media Plan Output: Demographic Shift Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Based on Knowledge Base, typical retail CAC is $20-80. Your $15 target is aggressive but achievable with precise targeting and strong creative.

What's your primary KPI - total new customers acquired, or are you also tracking revenue or ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) goals?

Turn 2:
Step 1 complete with Objective: 100K new customers, KPI: Customer acquisition + ROAS, Target: 100K customers at 4x+ ROAS. Now Step 2 Economics.

Your math works: $1.5M budget ÷ 100K customers = $15 CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost). With $350 LTV, that's 23x LTV:CAC ratio - excellent unit economics. Your 4x ROAS target aligns well since Based on Knowledge Base, typical retail ROAS is $3 to $8.

What's your average order value for new customers - is it around $60 to hit that 4x ROAS?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Step 2 complete. Your $15 CAC is aggressive but your 6x ROAS ($90 AOV ÷ $15 CAC) creates strong margin for efficiency. Now Step 3 Audience.

You mentioned Millennials 25-40 into streetwear - that's solid demographics. With your $15 CAC, tighter targeting helps conversion but streetwear/fashion is competitive, expect 15-20% higher CPMs. 

What triggers their purchases - new season drops, influencer collaborations, or specific lifestyle moments like concerts or festivals?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Perfect - seasonal drops and artist collabs are high-intent triggers. That behavioral data helps us target around release cycles and cultural moments.

Based on Knowledge Base, streetwear enthusiasts millennials 25-40 audience in top 25 DMAs is approximately 6.0% of population. In top 25 DMAs with ~165M total population, that's roughly 10M target audience.

Which specific DMAs are most important - are you seeing stronger performance in fashion-forward markets like LA, NYC, Miami versus broader metros?

Turn 5:
Got it - NYC/LA as core markets with Atlanta/Chicago as strong secondary. Based on Knowledge Base, streetwear enthusiasts millennials 25-40 audience in top 25 DMAs is approximately 6.0% of population.

Here's your audience sizing table:

| DMA | Population | Target Audience | Target % |
|-----|------------|-----------------|----------|
| New York | 20.1M | 1.21M | 6.0% |
| Los Angeles | 13.3M | 798K | 6.0% |
| Chicago | 9.5M | 570K | 6.0% |
| Atlanta | 6.0M | 360K | 6.0% |
| Miami | 2.7M | 162K | 6.0% |
| **Top 5 Total** | **51.6M** | **3.09M** | **6.0%** |
| **All 25 DMAs** | **165M** | **9.9M** | **6.0%** |

With 9.9M total audience and 100K customer target, you need 1% conversion rate from reach. Should we weight spend toward your top-performing markets like NYC/LA?

Turn 6:
Step 4 complete. Your 50-60% allocation to NYC/LA is smart - trend-setting markets drive broader adoption. Here's your weighted budget allocation:

| DMA | Target Audience | Budget Allocation | Spend Per Target | Target Customers |
|-----|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| New York | 1.21M | $450K (30%) | $372 | 30K |
| Los Angeles | 798K | $375K (25%) | $470 | 25K |
| Chicago | 570K | $300K (20%) | $526 | 20K |
| Atlanta | 360K | $225K (15%) | $625 | 15K |
| Miami | 162K | $150K (10%) | $926 | 10K |
| **TOTAL** | **3.09M** | **$1.5M** | **$485** | **100K** |

Now Step 5 Budget. With higher spend per target in smaller markets, what's your comfort level with the efficiency tradeoff in Miami versus scaling NYC/LA further?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Step 5 complete. Your geographic allocation balances efficiency with cultural presence - smart for streetwear brand building. Now Step 6 Value Proposition.

Based on Knowledge Base, streetwear brands succeed with authentic cultural connections versus pure product features. Your artist collabs and seasonal drops create scarcity-driven demand.

What's your core brand message - are you positioning as exclusive/limited culture or accessible streetwear for everyday urban style?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Good pivot - Gen Z drives streetwear culture and has higher digital engagement. Based on Knowledge Base, Gen Z streetwear enthusiasts 18-27 audience in top 25 DMAs is approximately 6.0% of population, similar size to Millennials.

Key changes: Gen Z prefers TikTok and Instagram over Facebook, responds better to micro-influencers, and has shorter attention spans requiring snappier creative. They're also more price-sensitive but value authenticity highly.

Does your $90 AOV hold for Gen Z, or do they typically buy smaller quantities initially?

Turn 10:
Perfect tiered strategy. Entry-level pieces at $25-35 remove purchase barriers, then retention drives higher-value repeat purchases.

Step 6 complete with Value Proposition: Accessible entry points with authentic streetwear credibility. Now Step 7 Channels.

Based on Knowledge Base, Gen Z heavily favors TikTok and Instagram for discovery. For streetwear, I'd recommend 70% social (TikTok/Instagram), 20% search, 10% retargeting.

With your tiered approach, should we split social spend between acquisition campaigns for entry pieces versus broader brand awareness?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
With $60-65 AOV and your $15 CAC target, that's 4x-4.3x ROAS - still solid but tighter margins. Based on Knowledge Base, typical retail CAC is $20-80, so your $15 target becomes more aggressive with Gen Z's lower initial AOV.

Higher repeat rates help long-term LTV, but we need efficient first-purchase acquisition. Your $1.5M budget still gets 100K customers, but less room for optimization mistakes.

Should we model a tiered approach - entry-level acquisition campaigns plus retention campaigns for repeat purchases?

Turn 11:
Excellent channel allocation. Based on Knowledge Base, Gen Z responds well to authentic brand storytelling, and your 40% acquisition/30% brand awareness split captures both immediate sales and cultural credibility.

For TikTok/Instagram, expect slightly higher CPMs for Gen Z (competitive audience) but better engagement rates. Your tiered creative approach - entry-level product ads plus artist collaboration content - aligns perfectly with Gen Z's preference for authentic brand experiences.

What's your measurement approach - will you track first-purchase CAC separately from overall customer LTV to optimize the funnel?
