# Media Plan Output: Outcome KPI Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Your $200 CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) target is ambitious. My estimate for insurance typically runs $250-400, but your strong LTV of $2,800 gives you a healthy 14:1 LTV:CAC ratio, which provides good margin for efficiency.

Step 1 complete with Objective: 25,000 new policy acquisitions, KPI: CAC, Target: $200. Now Step 2 Economics.

What's your typical time from first touch to policy purchase - are we measuring same-day conversions or allowing for longer consideration cycles?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect - that 45-60 day cycle means we need view-through attribution windows and nurture sequences. With your $200 CAC target and extended consideration, my estimate suggests we'll need 3-5% conversion rates from qualified traffic to hit efficiency targets.

Step 2 complete. Your $200 CAC is aggressive but achievable with proper nurturing and attribution modeling.

Now Step 3 Audience. You mentioned homeowners 35-65 with $100K+ income during life events. Beyond demographics, what behavioral triggers signal someone is actively shopping for insurance - are they researching coverage amounts, comparing quotes, or engaging with educational content about policy types?

Turn 3:
Excellent behavioral signals - that intent-based targeting should significantly improve your conversion rates versus demographic-only approaches. Based on Knowledge Base, your target audience represents approximately 6.0% of the total population, giving us a substantial addressable market.

With your $200 CAC target, this precision targeting increases conversion likelihood but may raise CPMs due to competitive bidding on high-intent audiences. The tradeoff favors efficiency over reach.

What's your primary geographic focus - are you licensed nationally, or should we concentrate on specific states or regions where you're most competitive?

Turn 4:
Based on Knowledge Base, your target audience represents approximately 6.0% of the population nationally. Here's the strategic market sizing:

| DMA | Population | Target Audience | Target % |
|-----|------------|-----------------|----------|
| Chicago | 9.5M | 570K | 6.0% |
| Atlanta | 6.0M | 360K | 6.0% |
| Miami-Ft. Lauderdale | 4.3M | 258K | 6.0% |
| Tampa-St. Petersburg | 3.1M | 186K | 6.0% |
| Columbus OH | 2.1M | 126K | 6.0% |
| **TOTAL TOP 5** | **25.0M** | **1.5M** | **6.0%** |

Your core markets offer 1.5M qualified prospects in just five DMAs. This concentration strategy should improve efficiency while maintaining substantial scale for your 25,000 acquisition target.

What percentage of your $5M budget should we weight toward these core markets versus maintaining national presence?

Turn 5:
Perfect allocation strategy. Based on Knowledge Base, concentrating 65-70% in core markets while maintaining national presence balances efficiency with brand building. Your approach should improve CAC in high-potential DMAs while preserving long-term growth options.

This gives us $3.25-3.5M for core markets and $1.5-1.75M for national presence - enough concentration to drive meaningful efficiency gains without sacrificing strategic positioning.

Step 4 complete with national strategy weighted 65-70% toward Midwest/Southeast core markets.

Now Step 5 Budget. With your $5M budget and 25,000 target acquisitions, that's exactly $200 per acquisition. Given insurance's 45-60 day consideration cycle, what's your current approach to nurturing prospects - do you have email sequences, retargeting campaigns, or content programs that help convert initial interest into policy sales?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Your basic nurture system is a solid foundation. Based on Knowledge Base, insurance's very long purchase cycle (quarterly-annual) requires strategic frequency capping and message timing - typically 1-2x monthly exposure with spikes during active consideration phases.

With your $5M budget and $200 CAC target, I'd recommend allocating 20-25% specifically to nurture and retargeting campaigns. This gives you $1-1.25M to develop sophisticated lifecycle messaging that matches prospect intent signals and life stage triggers.

Step 5 complete with $5M budget strategically allocated for core market concentration and nurture optimization.

What's your key value proposition against competitors - is it pricing, coverage breadth, claims experience, or something else that differentiates TrustGuard in the market?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Excellent positioning - white-glove claims and rapid response technology creates premium value justification. Based on Knowledge Base, premium positioning typically supports higher acquisition costs but requires sophisticated messaging to communicate value clearly.

Your tech-enabled claims experience directly addresses homeowners' biggest fear - being abandoned during crisis moments. This premium positioning should support your $200 CAC target by attracting customers willing to pay for superior service.

Step 6 complete with premium tech-enabled service positioning as key differentiator.

What channels are you currently using, and which ones have performed best for reaching your high-intent homeowner prospects during their research phase?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Got it - major strategic pivot from acquisition to brand defense. With a competitor entering aggressively, this shift makes perfect sense. Your $5M budget now needs to maximize reach and frequency for awareness rather than optimize for conversions.

Based on Knowledge Base, brand awareness campaigns require different channel mix prioritization - video and display for reach, with longer attribution windows to measure lift. My estimate suggests 15% awareness lift typically requires 60-80% reach with 3-4 frequency over 8-12 weeks.

This completely changes our approach: broader targeting (less precision), impression-focused channels (video, display, audio), and brand tracking studies instead of CAC measurement.

What's your timeline for achieving the 15% awareness lift - is this a sprint to counter the competitor launch, or a sustained brand building effort?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 9:
Perfect timing clarity - 8-10 week sprint campaign to counter competitive threat. Based on Knowledge Base, achieving 15% brand awareness lift requires 70-80% reach with 3-5 frequency over your flight period.

Your $5M budget in sprint mode should prioritize:
- **Video channels** for maximum reach (CTV, YouTube, linear if needed)
- **70%+ reach target** across your core demographics  
- **Weekly brand tracking** to monitor lift progression
- **3-5 frequency cap** to optimize awareness without waste

With weekly tracking, you'll see meaningful lift signals by week 3-4, allowing mid-flight optimization if needed.

What's your measurement setup - do you have a brand tracking vendor in place, or do we need to establish weekly awareness polling as part of the campaign launch?
