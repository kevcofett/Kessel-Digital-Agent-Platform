# Media Plan Output: Audience Addition Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
With your $2M budget and 5,000 lead target, that's $400 per lead. My estimate for wealth management CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) typically ranges $800-2,000, so you're planning strong top-of-funnel efficiency.

What's your lead-to-client conversion rate - how many of those 5,000 leads typically become paying clients?

Turn 2:
Step 1 complete with Objective: 5,000 qualified leads, KPI: Cost per lead, Target: $400. Now Step 2 Economics.

With 2.5% conversion (midpoint), you'll acquire ~125 clients at $16,000 per client ($2M ÷ 125). Against $15K LTV, that's a 0.94 LTV:CAC ratio - underwater economics. My estimate for sustainable wealth management is 3:1 minimum.

Your lead quality needs to improve dramatically, or conversion rate must reach 4-5% to hit breakeven. Which lever feels more realistic to move?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Perfect. At 4% conversion, you'd acquire 200 clients at $10,000 each - a healthy 1.5:1 LTV:CAC ratio. Based on Knowledge Base, conversion rate improvements of 35-60% are achievable through:

**Landing page optimization** - A/B test headlines and reduce form friction (5-15% lift)
**Lead scoring refinement** - Route highest-intent prospects to senior advisors first (10-20% lift) 
**Nurture sequence enhancement** - Multi-touch education before sales handoff (15-25% lift)

The compound effect gets you to 4%. Now let's define your audience precisely - beyond demographics, what behavioral triggers indicate someone is ready to consider switching wealth managers?

Turn 4:
Excellent behavioral profiling. Life transitions create urgency that demographic targeting alone misses. With your $10,000 CAC target, this precision targeting helps conversion but wealth management is highly competitive - expect 25-35% higher CPMs for behavioral audiences.

Net effect should still be positive given the conversion lift you're seeing. What contextual signals do these prospects show - specific content they consume or platforms where they research financial advice?

Turn 5:
Perfect media consumption profile - premium financial content indicates serious research behavior. Based on Knowledge Base, your target audience represents approximately 6.0% of the population in top 30 wealth markets.

Here's your audience sizing by top markets:

| DMA | Population | Target Audience | Target % |
|-----|------------|-----------------|-----------|
| New York | 20.1M | 1.21M | 6.0% |
| Los Angeles | 13.2M | 792K | 6.0% |
| Chicago | 9.5M | 570K | 6.0% |
| San Francisco | 4.7M | 282K | 6.0% |
| **Top 30 Total** | **156M** | **9.36M** | **6.0%** |

With 9.36M addressable audience and 5,000 lead target, you need 0.05% response rate - very achievable for wealth management. What's your geographic priority - should we weight toward highest wealth concentration markets?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Smart geographic focus. Based on Knowledge Base, your three priority markets contain 2.06M target prospects:

| DMA | Population | Target Audience | Target % |
|-----|------------|-----------------|-----------|
| New York | 20.1M | 1.21M | 6.0% |
| San Francisco | 4.7M | 282K | 6.0% |
| Chicago | 9.5M | 570K | 6.0% |
| **Priority Total** | **34.3M** | **2.06M** | **6.0%** |

With your $2M budget targeting these concentrated wealth markets, you'll have strong market presence. Step 4 complete. Now Step 5 Budget - how do you want to allocate the $2M across quarters, and do you have any seasonal considerations for wealth management decisions?

Turn 7:
Solid seasonal weighting - Q1 and Q4 align with wealth management decision cycles. Your allocation gives you $600K Q1, $400K Q2, $500K Q3, $500K Q4.

Based on Knowledge Base, watch Q4 carefully - CPMs typically run 30-60% higher during holiday competition, potentially pushing your $400 cost per lead to $520-640. Your Q4 allocation may need efficiency reserves or alternative channels.

What's your value proposition that differentiates WealthPath from competitors - comprehensive planning, fee transparency, or specialized expertise?

Turn 8:
Major strategic shift. Based on Knowledge Base, dual-audience campaigns need separate KPIs, budgets, and channel selection - you can't optimize blended metrics.

Your emerging affluent (30-45, $250K-1M assets) will have dramatically different:
- **Conversion rates** - likely 6-8% vs your 4% for retirees
- **LTV** - probably $3-5K vs $15K 
- **Channels** - LinkedIn, podcasts vs traditional financial media
- **Messaging** - wealth building vs wealth preservation

Should we split your $2M budget between segments, or expand total budget to serve both effectively?

Turn 9:
Smart budget expansion. Your $3.5M dual-segment approach protects the core while building future pipeline. My estimate for emerging affluent LTV is $4-6K based on lower assets under management but longer relationship duration.

With $1.5M for emerging affluent and assuming 6% conversion, you'd need 3,750 leads at $400 each, yielding ~225 clients at $6,667 CAC. Against $5K LTV estimate, that's 0.75:1 ratio - still underwater but acceptable for acquisition strategy.

Should we model both segments separately, or focus on optimizing your proven retiree segment first?

Turn 10:
Excellent prioritization. Let's nail the 55+ retiree segment with your proven $2M allocation. Step 6 complete with focused value proposition around wealth preservation expertise.

Now Step 7 Channels. Based on Knowledge Base, wealth management success comes from credibility-building touchpoints. Your target's media consumption suggests:

**LinkedIn** (30-35% allocation) - long-form thought leadership content
**Financial publication partnerships** (25-30%) - WSJ, Bloomberg native content  
**Podcast sponsorships** (20-25%) - investment strategy shows
**Search** (15-20%) - capture active research behavior

This mix aligns with their premium content consumption and builds advisory credibility. Which channel feels most natural for WealthPath's expertise positioning?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 11:
Perfect LinkedIn focus. Based on Knowledge Base, LinkedIn for wealth management runs $45-55 CPM with 0.3-0.5% CTR. With your thought leadership approach, expect higher engagement than typical financial services.

At 40% LinkedIn allocation ($800K), you'd generate ~16M impressions and 64K clicks, yielding ~2,560 leads at $312 each - well under your $400 target.

Your advisor expertise gives LinkedIn authenticity that paid ads lack. What's your measurement approach - will you track leads by advisor content, or aggregate campaign performance?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 12:
Smart measurement evolution plan. Based on Knowledge Base, start with Level 2 measurement - cross-platform dashboard with multi-touch attribution. For advisor tracking, implement UTM parameters by content creator plus LinkedIn's native analytics.

Step 7 complete with LinkedIn-focused channel strategy. Step 8 Measurement: Track aggregate performance first, then layer advisor-level attribution. Use 7-day click, 1-day view attribution window for wealth management's longer consideration cycle.

Now Step 9 Testing - what's your biggest assumption we should test first: LinkedIn content performance, geographic allocation, or lead quality scoring?
