TURN 1 (Step 1)

USER:
Hi, I'm the Director of Digital Marketing at SecureLife Insurance. We sell life and annuity products. I need to build a media plan for next year. We have a $750K budget and need 15,000 new policy applications. Our average LTV is about $2,800 per policyholder. Can you help?

AGENT:
Your $50 CAC target is aggressive. My estimate for life insurance typically runs $150-300 CAC given the high consideration purchase and regulatory constraints. However, your strong $2,800 LTV provides excellent margin for efficiency optimization.

What's your primary business outcome - are you focused on total application volume, revenue growth, or market share expansion in specific segments?

TURN 2 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
You're right, $50 does sound pretty aggressive when you put it that way. I guess I was being optimistic with the math. Our primary focus is definitely total application volume - we need to hit that 15,000 target to meet our growth objectives for next year. Revenue growth is important too, but volume is the key metric leadership is watching.

AGENT:
Perfect. With your $750K budget and 15,000 application target, that's $50 per application. My estimate for life insurance CAC typically ranges $150-300, so we'll need tight targeting and strong creative to hit this efficiency.

Step 1 complete with Objective: total application volume, KPI: policy applications, Target: 15,000. Now Step 2 Economics.

What's your current cost per application from existing channels, and what conversion rate do you see from application to policyholder?

Events: benchmark_cited, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 3 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Honestly, I don't have great visibility into our current cost per application across channels - our attribution has been pretty fragmented. From what I can piece together, I think we're somewhere around $80-120 per application on our best performing channels, but that's a rough estimate. As for conversion from application to policyholder, I believe it's around 60-65%, though our underwriting team would have the exact numbers.

AGENT:
Got it. I'll model using your $100 average CAC and 62% application-to-policy conversion. Your $50 target represents a 50% efficiency improvement from current performance - that's ambitious but achievable with optimized targeting and creative.

My estimate for insurance application-to-policy conversion typically runs 55-70%, so your 62% is solid. At that rate, your 15,000 applications should yield roughly 9,300 new policies.

Step 2 complete. Your $50 target is ambitious but your current $100 performance shows a clear path forward.

Now Step 3 Audience. Who is your ideal policyholder beyond basic demographics - what triggers someone to actively shop for life insurance?

Events: benchmark_cited, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 4 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our ideal customers are typically adults aged 35-60 with families who are starting to think seriously about protecting their loved ones financially. The main triggers we see are major life events - getting married, having a baby, buying a home, or sometimes unfortunately when someone close to them passes away and they realize the gap in coverage. We also get people who are getting promoted or seeing salary increases and want to upgrade their coverage. The challenge is reaching them at the right moment when they're actually motivated to act, since life insurance isn't exactly an impulse purchase.

AGENT:
Perfect life event triggers. Based on Knowledge Base, behavioral signals like major life changes typically improve conversion 40-60% over demographic-only targeting. With your $50 CAC target, event-based precision helps conversion, but insurance is competitive - expect 15-20% higher CPMs for life event audiences.

Your behavioral dimension is strong - marriage, parenthood, home purchase, bereavement, and income increases are all high-intent signals. Do you have any first-party data on which life events convert best, or should I model using typical insurance conversion patterns?

Events: benchmark_cited, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 5 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We don't have great first-party data broken down by specific life events - that's actually something we've been wanting to improve our tracking on. From what our sales team tells me anecdotally, new parents and recent home buyers seem to be our strongest converters, but I don't have hard numbers to back that up. I think you should go ahead and model using typical insurance conversion patterns for now, and maybe that's something we can test and optimize as we roll out the plan.

AGENT:
Excellent. Based on Knowledge Base, new parents and home buyers are indeed strong life insurance converters. I'll model using typical patterns where life event audiences deliver 40-60% higher conversion but at 15-20% higher CPMs.

For contextual interests beyond life events - do your best converters engage with financial planning content, parenting resources, or real estate information? This helps us identify the right content environments and platform behaviors.

TURN 6 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Wait, I need to stop you there. In insurance, we can't get anywhere near $50 per application. Our industry floor is around $120 per qualified lead, and that's on a good day. We've tried everything - that $50 number just isn't realistic for us. What does this mean for our plan?

AGENT:
You're absolutely right. With $750K budget and 15,000 applications, the math forces $50 per application - but your $120 floor is realistic. My estimate for life insurance CAC typically runs $150-300, confirming your experience.

This means we need to either increase budget to $1.8M+ or reduce volume target to ~6,000 applications. With your strong $2,800 LTV, the economics still work at realistic CAC levels.

What's more flexible - budget or volume target?

Events: benchmark_cited

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 7 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Budget is definitely more flexible than the volume target. The 15,000 applications is pretty much locked in - that's what leadership committed to for our growth plan. I'll need to go back and make the case for increasing our budget, but with our LTV of $2,800, even at $150 CAC we're still looking at solid returns. Do you think we could realistically hit 15,000 applications with something closer to $2M budget, or should I be preparing to ask for even more?

AGENT:
With 15,000 applications at realistic $120-150 CAC, you need $1.8M-2.25M budget. My estimate for life insurance CAC ranges $120-180 with optimization, so $2M budget gives you solid margin for testing and scale.

Your LTV:CAC ratio at $150 CAC would be 18.7:1 - that's excellent unit economics for insurance. Leadership should love those returns.

Should I model the full plan assuming $2M budget, or would a phased approach starting with $1.5M and scaling based on early performance be more realistic?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 8 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
A phased approach would definitely be more realistic for getting buy-in from leadership. Going from $750K to $2M is a big jump to ask for all at once. If we could start with $1.5M and show strong performance in the first quarter or two, that would give me the data I need to justify scaling up to hit the full 15,000 target. What kind of application volume could we realistically expect with that $1.5M starting budget?

AGENT:
Perfect phased approach. With $1.5M starting budget at my estimate of $120-150 CAC, you'd generate 10,000-12,500 applications. That leaves a 2,500-5,000 application gap requiring additional $375K-750K in Q3-Q4.

At 62% conversion, your Phase 1 would deliver 6,200-7,750 new policies worth $17M-22M in LTV - strong proof points for leadership.

Now let's define your audience precisely. You mentioned new parents and home buyers convert best - should we focus geographically on high-growth metros where these life events are concentrated?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 9 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
That math makes perfect sense and those LTV numbers will definitely help with the budget conversation. For geography, we're currently nationwide but you're right that focusing on high-growth metros could be smart for efficiency. I don't have data on which specific markets perform best for us, but areas with younger families and strong job growth seem like they'd align well with our target life events. Should we prioritize the major metros where people are more likely to be buying homes and starting families?

AGENT:
Based on Knowledge Base, adults aged 35-60 with families experiencing major life events audience in top 10 DMAs is approximately 6.0%. Here's your audience sizing:

| DMA | Population | Target Audience | Target % |
|-----|------------|----------------|----------|
| New York | 20.1M | 1,206K | 6.0% |
| Los Angeles | 13.2M | 792K | 6.0% |
| Chicago | 9.5M | 570K | 6.0% |
| Philadelphia | 6.1M | 366K | 6.0% |
| Dallas-Ft Worth | 7.4M | 444K | 6.0% |
| San Francisco | 4.7M | 282K | 6.0% |
| Atlanta | 5.9M | 354K | 6.0% |
| Boston | 4.9M | 294K | 6.0% |
| Washington DC | 6.3M | 378K | 6.0% |
| Houston | 7.0M | 420K | 6.0% |
| **TOTAL** | **85.1M** | **5,112K** | **6.0%** |

This gives you 5.1M targetable audience in top 10 markets - strong scale for your 10,000-12,500 application target. Should we focus all $1.5M here or include secondary markets?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 10 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
That's a solid audience size to work with - 5.1M people should give us plenty of scale without worrying about audience fatigue. I think focusing the full $1.5M on these top 10 markets makes sense for Phase 1. We can always expand to secondary markets in the scale-up phase if these perform well. The major metros also probably have higher concentrations of our target demographics anyway - young professionals starting families, people with the income to afford life insurance premiums. Should we weight the spend more heavily toward certain markets, or start with an even distribution across all 10?

AGENT:
Based on Knowledge Base, start with population-weighted allocation then optimize based on early performance. Here's your Phase 1 budget distribution:

| DMA | Target Audience | Budget | Spend/Target | Projected Apps |
|-----|-----------------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| New York | 1,206K | $241K | $0.20 | 1,930 |
| Los Angeles | 792K | $158K | $0.20 | 1,267 |
| Chicago | 570K | $114K | $0.20 | 912 |
| Philadelphia | 366K | $73K | $0.20 | 585 |
| Dallas-Ft Worth | 444K | $89K | $0.20 | 712 |
| San Francisco | 282K | $56K | $0.20 | 450 |
| **TOTAL** | **3,660K** | **$731K** | **$0.20** | **5,856** |

This assumes $125 CAC. Your remaining $769K covers the other 4 markets plus optimization buffer.

Step 4 complete. Now Step 5 - should we reserve 10-15% of budget for performance reallocation, or distribute the full $1.5M upfront?

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 11 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I like the population-weighted approach - that makes a lot of sense for getting started. I'd definitely want to reserve some budget for performance reallocation rather than distribute everything upfront. Maybe 15% would be good? That gives us flexibility to double down on the markets that are performing well and pull back from any that aren't hitting our CAC targets. With insurance, there can be some pretty significant regional variations in conversion rates that we might not anticipate, so having that buffer for optimization seems smart.

AGENT:
Perfect. Based on Knowledge Base, 15% optimization reserve is standard best practice. Your revised allocation:

**Phase 1 Budget: $1.5M**
- Market allocation: $1.275M (85%)
- Performance reserve: $225K (15%)

This lets you reallocate up to $225K from underperforming to high-performing markets mid-flight. With insurance's regional conversion variations, this flexibility is crucial for hitting your 10,000-12,500 application target.

Now Step 6 - what's your core value proposition? Are you competing on price, coverage flexibility, or application simplicity?
