## FULL-001: Complete Linear Flow - B2B SaaS ❌
Duration: 164.7s | Turns: 25/25

### Turn 1
**User:** Hi, I need help creating a media plan.
**Agent:** Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What business outcome are you trying to achieve?
**Scores:** {'response_length': 1.0, 'single_question': 1.0, 'tone': 0.5}

### Turn 2
**User:** We want to generate qualified leads for our B2B software product.
**Agent:** Great! Lead generation gives us a clear direction. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success.

What's your primary KPI - how will you measure qualified leads? (For example: marketing qualified leads, sales qualified leads, or leads that meet specific criteria?)
**Scores:** {'single_question': 0.0, 'step_completion': 0.5}

### Turn 3
**User:** A qualified lead is someone who books a demo with our sales team.
**Agent:** Perfect - demo bookings is a clear, actionable KPI. 

How many demo bookings are you targeting over what time period?
**Scores:** {'single_question': 1.0, 'step_completion': 0.5}

### Turn 4
**User:** We want 500 demo bookings this quarter. Our budget is $150,000.
**Agent:** Excellent! That gives me the core framework. Let me run the math on what you're targeting:

**Your implied efficiency target:** $300 cost per demo booking ($150k ÷ 500 demos)

Based on Knowledge Base benchmarks, B2B software demo costs typically range from $200-600, with $300-400 being common for mi...
**Scores:** {'proactive_intelligence': 0.7, 'source_citation': 1.0, 'feasibility_framing': 1.0}

### Turn 5
**User:** Is that a realistic target?
**Agent:** Yes, $300 per demo booking is realistic for B2B software. Based on Knowledge Base benchmarks, it sits in the lower-middle range of typical performance ($200-600), which means it's achievable with good targeting and execution.

The key factors that will determine success:
- How well-defined your targ...
**Scores:** {'source_citation': 1.0, 'feasibility_framing': 1.0}

### Turn 6
**User:** What's the typical lifetime value for customers in this space?
**Agent:** I don't have specific lifetime value data for your software category without knowing more details like your price point, contract length, and retention rates.

I'll model using a reasonable assumption based on typical B2B software: $25,000 annual contract value with 2-year retention = $50,000 LTV. Y...
**Scores:** {'source_citation': 0.0, 'proactive_intelligence': 1.0}

### Turn 7
**User:** Our average contract is $50,000 annually with 80% gross margin.
**Agent:** Perfect! That's valuable data. With $50,000 annual contracts at 80% margin, you have $40,000 in gross profit per customer.

What's your demo-to-customer conversion rate - what percentage of demos turn into paying customers?
**Scores:** {'proactive_intelligence': 1.0, 'step_completion': 0.5}

### Turn 8
**User:** Who should we be targeting?
**Agent:** Let me finish the economics first, then we'll dive deep into targeting. 

What percentage of your demos typically convert to paying customers? (If you don't know the exact rate, a rough estimate works - we can model and refine.)
**Scores:** {'step_boundary': 0.5, 'single_question': 1.0}

### Turn 9
**User:** IT directors and CIOs at mid-market companies, 500-5000 employees, in financial services and healthcare.
**Agent:** Good start on targeting! I still need to complete the economics to make sure your plan is viable.

What percentage of demos convert to customers? Even a rough estimate helps - like "about 1 in 10" or "around 20%."
**Scores:** {'proactive_intelligence': 1.0, 'source_citation': 0.0}

### Turn 10
**User:** Where should we focus geographically?
**Agent:** I understand you want to move ahead, but let me quickly complete the economics so we can validate your $300 per demo target.

If you don't know your demo-to-customer conversion rate, I'll model using 15% (typical B2B software benchmark) and we can adjust later.

**Quick validation:** 15% conversion ...
**Scores:** {'step_boundary': 0.5, 'single_question': 1.0}

### Turn 11
**User:** US only, focused on major metros - NYC, SF, Chicago, Boston, LA.
**Agent:** Perfect! US major metros gives us concentrated, high-value markets.

Now let's define your audience more precisely. You mentioned IT directors and CIOs at 500-5000 employee companies in financial services and healthcare.

Are there specific pain points or use cases that make someone more likely to b...

### Turn 12
**User:** We already said our budget is $150K. What else do you need?
**Agent:** You're right - we have the budget. Let me model what we've established:

**Current Plan Analysis:**
- Target: 500 demos at $300 each = $150K budget ✓
- Audience: IT directors/CIOs, 500-5K employees, finance/healthcare
- Geography: 5 major US metros

**Scores:** {'self_referential_learning': 0.5, 'single_question': 1.0}

### Turn 13
**User:** The campaign runs Q2, April through June.
**Agent:** Got it - Q2 campaign timeline noted.

What's your key value proposition - what specific problem does your software solve that would make an IT director want to book a demo?
**Scores:** {'proactive_intelligence': 1.0, 'step_completion': 0.5}

### Turn 14
**User:** What makes our product unique is that we reduce compliance costs by 40% guaranteed.
**Agent:** Excellent! "40% guaranteed compliance cost reduction" is a powerful, specific value prop that should resonate strongly with IT leaders in finance and healthcare.

Now for channels. Given your B2B audience, budget, and metro focus, I'd recommend starting with:

**Primary channels:**
- LinkedIn Ads (p...
**Scores:** {'step_completion': 0.5}

### Turn 15
**User:** Now what channels should we use?
**Agent:** Based on your profile and objectives, I recommend this channel mix:

**Primary channels (80% of budget):**

**Agent:** LinkedIn excels for your specific needs:

**Professional context:** Your compliance ...
**Scores:** {'source_citation': 1.0, 'tone': 0.5}

### Turn 17
**User:** What about Google?

**Different audience overlap:** Catches IT directors rese...
**Scores:** {'source_citation': 0.0, 'proactive_intelligence': 1.0}

### Turn 18
**User:** How should we split the budget across channels?
**Agent:** I already recommended the split:

**LinkedIn: $90K (60%)**
- Precision targeting your exact titles/industries
- Primary volume driver

**Google: $30K (20%)**  
- High-intent search capture
- Higher conversion rates but lower volume

- Lead quality scores from sales team

**Optimization metrics:**

**Scores:** {'step_boundary': 0.5, 'source_citation': 0.0}

### Turn 20
**User:** Should we use ROAS as our primary metric?
**Agent:** No, I'd avoid ROAS as your primary KPI. Here's why:

**Platform inflation:** LinkedIn and Google often attribute conversions they didn't actually drive, inflating reported ROAS.

**Attribution gaps:** B2B buyers research across multiple touchpoints over weeks/months. Platform ROAS misses this comple...

Duration: 159.3s | Turns: 24/24

### Turn 1
**User:** I need a media plan for our direct-to-consumer skincare brand.
**Agent:** Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What business outcome are you trying to achieve with this campaign?
**Scores:** {'response_length': 1.0, 'single_question': 1.0, 'tone': 0.5}

### Turn 2
**User:** We want to acquire new customers profitably.

How will you measure success as a number - is it total new customers acquired, or are you focused on a specific revenue target from new customers?
**Scores:** {'single_question': 1.0, 'step_completion': 0.5}

### Turn 3
**User:** A new customer is someone who makes their first purchase.
**Agent:** Got it - so we're measuring success by total new customers who make their first purchase.

What's your volume target? How many new customers do you want to acquire?
**Scores:** {'single_question': 0.0}

### Turn 4
**User:** We have $500,000 for the year and want 10,000 new customers.
**Agent:** Excellent! Now I can model this. With $500K to acquire 10,000 customers, you need a $50 cost per customer acquisition (CAC).

This moves us into economics. What's the average revenue from a first purchase with your skincare brand?

With a $50 CAC and only $34 first-purchase profit, you're $16 underwater initially. Do you have data on customer lifetime value or repeat ...
