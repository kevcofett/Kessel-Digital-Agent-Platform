ROAS misses the complex B2B buyer journey.\n\n**Wrong optimization** - ROAS pushes toward cheaper, lower-quality leads instead of qualified demos that actually convert.\n\nStick with demo bookings as your primary KPI. It's clean, measurable, and directly tied to sales outcomes. Your sales team can tell you if demo quality drops - ROAS can't.\n\nTrack cost per demo instead.
