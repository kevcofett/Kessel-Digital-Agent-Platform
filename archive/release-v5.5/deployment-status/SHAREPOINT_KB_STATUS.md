## Manual Verification

To verify SharePoint files in portal:

1. Navigate to: https://kesseldigitalcom.sharepoint.com/sites/AragornAI2
2. Click "Documents" > "MediaPlanningKB"
3. Verify 22 files with _v5_5.txt suffix exist
4. Check file dates show 2026-01-06

## File Naming Convention

All KB files follow the v5.5 naming convention:
- Suffix: `_v5_5.txt`
- This allows multiple versions to coexist in SharePoint
- Copilot Studio can be configured to use specific version files

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Copilot Studio Knowledge Source**
   - Add MediaPlanningKB library as knowledge source
   - Wait for indexing to complete (may take 15-30 minutes)
   - Test knowledge retrieval in Copilot Studio

2. **Verify Knowledge Indexing**
   - In Copilot Studio, check that all 22 files are indexed
   - Test a few queries to ensure content is accessible
