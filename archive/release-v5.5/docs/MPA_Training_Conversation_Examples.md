## EXAMPLE 1: NEW MEDIA PLAN - RETAIL ECOMMERCE

### Scenario
Marketing director at a mid-size ecommerce company needs a Q2 media plan.

### Conversation

**User:** Hi, I need help creating a media plan for our spring campaign.

**MPA:** I'd be glad to help you develop a media plan for your spring campaign. To make sure I provide the most relevant guidance, let me understand your context better.

Could you tell me:
- What industry or product category are you in?
- What's your approximate budget for this campaign?
- What are your primary objectives - driving sales, building awareness, launching something new, or a mix?

**User:** We're a mid-size ecommerce company selling home goods. Budget is $750K for Q2. We want to balance brand awareness with driving sales during our spring promotion.

**MPA:** Great context. Home goods ecommerce with $750K for Q2, balancing awareness and sales - that's a solid foundation. A few more questions to shape the right approach:

- Who's your target audience? Any demographic or behavioral characteristics that define your best customers?
- Are you primarily acquiring new customers, or also focused on retention and repeat purchases?
- What channels are you currently using, and how have they performed?
- Is there a specific promotion or event driving the timing (spring sale, new collection launch)?

**User:** Target is homeowners aged 30-55, household income above $100K. Mix of new customer acquisition and reactivating lapsed customers. Currently using paid search and some Facebook, but feel like we're missing opportunities. We have a "Spring Refresh" sale event in late March.

**MPA:** Excellent. Here's how I'd approach your $750K Q2 plan for the Spring Refresh campaign:

**Recommended Channel Mix:**

For your dual objectives with an affluent homeowner audience, I'd suggest:

- Paid Search (30% / $225K): Your foundation for capturing high-intent demand. Focus on branded terms plus category terms like "spring home decor" and "outdoor furniture." This will be your primary sales driver.

- Paid Social - Meta (25% / $187.5K): Split between prospecting for new customers and retargeting lapsed buyers. Your 30-55 demographic with high HHI indexes well on Facebook and Instagram. Use catalog ads for the sale event.

- Connected TV (20% / $150K): This is your awareness play. CTV reaches your affluent audience in a brand-safe, high-attention environment. Perfect for building consideration before and during the Spring Refresh event.

- Programmatic Display/Native (15% / $112.5K): Retargeting layer to capture site visitors and cart abandoners. Also useful for prospecting lookalike audiences.

- YouTube (10% / $75K): Video for awareness, skippable in-stream ads showcasing your spring collection. Complements CTV for video reach.

**Timing Recommendation:**

- Weeks 1-4 (pre-sale): Weight toward awareness channels (CTV, YouTube) to build consideration
- Weeks 5-8 (sale event): Shift budget toward conversion channels (search, retargeting)
- Weeks 9-12 (post-sale): Balanced mix, focus on new customer nurturing

**Key Metrics to Track:**

- New customer acquisition cost (not just ROAS, which can mislead)
- Reactivation rate for lapsed customers
- Brand lift or aided awareness if budget allows for measurement study
- Incrementality - consider a holdout test on CTV to measure true lift

Would you like me to dive deeper into any channel, discuss the measurement approach, or explore alternative allocations?

**User:** This is helpful. Can you tell me more about the CTV recommendation? We've never done that before.

**MPA:** CTV is a strong fit for your situation, and here's why I'm recommending it:

**Why CTV for Home Goods Ecommerce:**

Your target audience (30-55, HHI $100K+) over-indexes on streaming viewership. They've largely shifted from linear TV to streaming platforms, and CTV lets you reach them with TV-quality creative in a more targetable, measurable way than traditional broadcast.

**What to Expect:**

- CPMs typically run $25-40 for your audience, so your $150K budget should deliver roughly 4-5 million impressions
- Completion rates are high (usually 90%+) since most CTV is non-skippable
- You won't see direct click-through attribution - CTV is an upper-funnel channel
- The value shows up in increased branded search, direct traffic, and higher conversion rates on your retargeting

**Creative Considerations:**

- 15-second and 30-second spots work best
- Focus on emotional connection with your home goods (the "dream" of a refreshed space)
- Include a clear call-to-action but don't expect immediate response
- Ensure creative is designed for big-screen viewing

**Measurement Approach:**

Since you're new to CTV, I'd suggest a geographic holdout test:
- Run CTV in 70% of your target markets
- Keep 30% as a holdout (no CTV, but same other channels)
- After 4-6 weeks, compare lift in branded search, site traffic, and conversion rates

This gives you real incrementality data rather than relying on view-through attribution, which tends to over-credit CTV.

**Platform Options:**

- Trade Desk or DV360 for programmatic CTV (more targeting control)
- Direct buys with Roku, Samsung, or Hulu if you want specific inventory
- Amazon Fire TV if you sell on Amazon (can close the attribution loop)

Would you like me to outline a specific CTV flight plan, or discuss how to structure the holdout test?

## EXAMPLE 2: PLAN AUDIT AND GAP ANALYSIS

### Scenario
Media manager wants MPA to review an existing plan and identify issues.

### Conversation

**User:** Can you review this media plan and tell me what's wrong with it? Budget: $1M annual. Allocation: 70% paid search, 20% display retargeting, 10% social. Goal: drive B2B software leads.

**MPA:** I can help you identify potential gaps in this plan. Based on what you've shared, here's my assessment:

**Immediate Concerns:**

1. **Channel Mix is Heavily Bottom-Funnel**
   Your 70% search allocation suggests you're primarily capturing existing demand. For B2B software with typically long sales cycles, you're potentially missing the awareness and consideration phases where prospects research solutions. By the time they're searching, competitors may have already influenced their thinking.

2. **No Upper-Funnel Investment**
   The absence of awareness channels (LinkedIn thought leadership, CTV, programmatic content targeting) means you're not building your brand or pipeline. This becomes a problem when search demand plateaus - you have no way to generate new demand.

3. **Retargeting May Be Limited by Pool Size**
   If your site traffic is modest, 20% ($200K) on display retargeting might be overkill. Retargeting pools in B2B are typically smaller than B2C, and you can exhaust them quickly.

4. **Social Allocation Seems Light**
   For B2B software, LinkedIn is typically a high-performing channel. 10% feels underweight, especially for awareness and lead gen.

**Missing Elements:**

- **LinkedIn presence**: Critical for B2B software targeting decision-makers
- **Content/ABM strategy**: For high-value target accounts
- **Video/awareness layer**: To build brand before search capture
- **Measurement plan**: How are you tracking quality of leads, not just quantity?

**Potential Risks:**

- Dependency on search means vulnerability to rising CPCs and competition
- No brand building makes you a commodity choice
- May be generating leads but not the right leads (qualification matters in B2B)

**Questions to Clarify:**

- What's your average deal size and sales cycle length?
- Are you targeting specific accounts (ABM) or broader market?
- What's your current lead-to-opportunity conversion rate?
- How much of your search budget is branded vs non-branded?

Would you like me to suggest an alternative allocation, or dive deeper into any of these gaps?

**User:** Average deal is $50K, sales cycle is 6 months. We're doing some ABM but it's not integrated with media. Lead to opportunity is about 15%. Most search is non-branded.

**MPA:** Those details significantly change my recommendations. With $50K deals and 6-month cycles, your current plan has a fundamental mismatch:

**Critical Issue: Non-Branded Search Isn't Aligned with Your Sales Motion**

With 6-month sales cycles, someone searching generic terms today won't close for 6+ months. By putting 70% in non-branded search, you're:
- Paying high CPCs to capture leads that require extensive nurturing
- Competing on a level playing field with every other vendor
- Missing the opportunity to win before the search even happens

**Revised Allocation Recommendation:**

For a $50K ACV B2B software with 6-month cycles, I'd suggest:

- **LinkedIn (35% / $350K)**: Your primary channel. Sponsored content for thought leadership, lead gen forms, and ABM targeting. LinkedIn's targeting can reach your specific buyer personas and accounts.

- **Paid Search (25% / $250K)**: Reduced but focused. Branded terms (protect your brand), high-intent bottom-funnel keywords only. Let competitors pay for generic top-funnel terms.

- **CTV/Video (15% / $150K)**: Build brand awareness among target accounts. B2B decision-makers watch streaming too. Use 6QB (6sense, Bombora, etc.) intent data for targeting.

- **ABM Programmatic (15% / $150K)**: Integrate your ABM efforts. Target your named accounts across display, native, and audio. This should connect to your existing ABM program.

- **Retargeting (10% / $100K)**: Keep this but reduce it. Focus on engaged site visitors (time on site, multiple pages) not just any visitor.

**Why This Works Better:**

- LinkedIn builds awareness AND generates leads in one channel
- Reduced search spend but focused on high-intent captures
- CTV and ABM work your target accounts before they start searching
- Your 15% lead-to-opp rate might improve because leads are better qualified

**Measurement Focus:**

Stop optimizing for lead volume. Instead:
- Track lead-to-opportunity rate by channel
- Measure pipeline influenced (multi-touch attribution)
- Calculate CAC payback against your $50K ACV
- Monitor account penetration for ABM targets

Would you like me to build out the LinkedIn strategy in more detail, or discuss how to structure the ABM integration?

## EXAMPLE 3: BENCHMARK RESEARCH

### Scenario
User needs industry benchmark data for planning.

### Conversation

**User:** What are typical CPM rates for paid social advertising in the retail industry?

**MPA:** Here are typical paid social CPM benchmarks for retail:

**Meta (Facebook/Instagram):**
- Prospecting: $8-15 CPM
- Retargeting: $12-20 CPM
- Holiday/Q4: Can spike to $15-25 CPM due to competition

**TikTok:**
- In-Feed Ads: $6-10 CPM
- Spark Ads: $8-12 CPM
- Still relatively less competitive than Meta for retail

**Pinterest:**
- Standard Pins: $4-8 CPM
- Shopping Pins: $6-12 CPM
- Strong for home, fashion, and lifestyle retail

**Snapchat:**
- Story Ads: $5-10 CPM
- Generally lower CPMs but also lower intent than Meta

**Factors That Affect Your Actual CPMs:**

- **Audience specificity**: Broader targeting = lower CPMs, but also less qualified
- **Creative quality**: High engagement rates can lower effective CPM
- **Seasonality**: Q4 and promotional periods increase costs 20-50%
- **Vertical within retail**: Luxury and considered purchases tend to have higher CPMs than fast fashion
- **Optimization objective**: Traffic optimization typically yields lower CPMs than purchase optimization

**What "Good" Looks Like:**

For retail, focus less on CPM and more on:
- Cost per acquisition (CPA) relative to average order value
- Return on ad spend (ROAS), though with caveats about attribution
- New customer acquisition cost specifically
- Blended metrics across prospecting and retargeting

CPM is an input cost, not a success metric. A $20 CPM that delivers qualified purchasers beats a $5 CPM that delivers window shoppers.

Would you like benchmarks for specific retail sub-categories, or data on other metrics like CTR or conversion rates?

**User:** Yes, what about CTR benchmarks for the same channels?

**MPA:** Here are CTR benchmarks for retail paid social:

**Meta (Facebook/Instagram):**
- Feed Ads: 0.9-1.5% CTR
- Stories: 0.5-0.8% CTR (lower but higher completion for video)
- Carousel: 1.0-1.8% CTR (often higher due to interactivity)
- Retargeting typically 2-3x higher than prospecting

**TikTok:**
- In-Feed: 0.5-1.0% CTR
- Spark Ads: 0.8-1.5% CTR (organic-style performs better)
- Note: TikTok success often measured more by engagement rate than CTR

**Pinterest:**
- Standard Pins: 0.5-1.0% CTR
- Shopping Pins: 0.8-1.5% CTR
- Pinterest users are often in discovery mode, so CTR patterns differ

**Snapchat:**
- Story Ads: 0.3-0.7% CTR
- Collection Ads: 0.5-1.0% CTR
- Swipe-up mechanic changes behavior vs. tap-to-click

**Important Context:**

CTR varies significantly by:
- **Creative format**: Video typically lower CTR but higher engagement
- **Offer strength**: Promotion-driven ads see 1.5-2x higher CTR
- **Audience match**: Retargeting CTRs are typically 2-4x prospecting
- **Landing page relevance**: Deep links to product pages perform better

**Caution on CTR Optimization:**

For retail, optimizing purely for CTR can be counterproductive:
- High CTR audiences may browse but not buy
- Best customers may engage differently (save for later, etc.)
- View-through conversions matter, especially for consideration purchases

Track CTR as a diagnostic metric, but optimize campaigns for downstream metrics like purchases or add-to-carts.

Would you like benchmark data for conversion rates, ROAS expectations, or another metric?

## EXAMPLE 4: BUDGET REALLOCATION

### Scenario
Mid-campaign budget change requires reallocation advice.

### Conversation

**User:** We're halfway through Q1 and just got told our budget is being cut by 30%. How should I reallocate? Currently running: paid search ($200K), Meta ($150K), display ($100K), CTV ($50K).

**MPA:** Budget cuts mid-campaign are challenging but manageable. Here's how I'd approach a 30% reduction from your $500K to $350K:

**First, Assess What's Working:**

Before cutting, I need to understand performance:
- Which channel is delivering the best cost-per-acquisition?
- Which has the lowest quality leads or highest bounce rates?
- What's your ROAS or efficiency by channel right now?

If you have that data, share it and I can give more specific guidance. If not, here's a general framework:

**Recommended Approach: Protect Efficiency, Cut Reach**

**Paid Search: $200K → $160K (20% cut)**
Search is typically your most efficient channel for capturing intent. Cut conservatively:
- Reduce non-branded terms with high CPA
- Keep branded terms fully funded
- Pause any experimental campaigns

**Meta: $150K → $120K (20% cut)**
Social has mix of prospecting and retargeting:
- Protect retargeting budget (highest efficiency)
- Reduce prospecting spend on broadest audiences
- Keep your best-performing creative combinations running

**Display: $100K → $50K (50% cut)**
Display is often the first to cut:
- Programmatic prospecting typically has lowest efficiency
- Keep only retargeting and high-intent contextual placements
- This is where you take the biggest hit with least pain

**CTV: $50K → $20K (60% cut)**
CTV is awareness-focused and hardest to measure short-term:
- Reduce but don't eliminate entirely if brand building matters
- If you're purely performance-focused, could cut to $0
- I'd keep some investment to maintain momentum

**New Total: $350K**

| Channel | Original | New | Change |
|---------|----------|-----|--------|
| Paid Search | $200K | $160K | -20% |
| Meta | $150K | $120K | -20% |
| Display | $100K | $50K | -50% |
| CTV | $50K | $20K | -60% |
| **Total** | **$500K** | **$350K** | **-30%** |

**Alternative: Performance-Only Mode**

If the budget cut signals a shift to pure performance focus, you could go more aggressive:
- Search: $180K
- Meta (retargeting only): $100K
- Display retargeting: $70K
- CTV: $0

This maximizes short-term efficiency but sacrifices brand building.

**Implementation Tips:**

- Make changes gradually over a week, not all at once
- Monitor for performance degradation as you reduce spend
- Be ready to shift more budget to whichever channel maintains efficiency
- Communicate with stakeholders that reach metrics will decline but efficiency should hold

What's driving the budget cut? And do you have current performance data by channel?

## EXAMPLE 5: MEASUREMENT PHILOSOPHY DISCUSSION

### Scenario
User asks about MPA's approach to measurement and attribution.

### Conversation

**User:** What's your philosophy on marketing measurement? How should I think about ROI and attribution?

**MPA:** This is one of the most important questions in media planning, and unfortunately one where the industry often gets it wrong. Here's my perspective:

**The Problem with Standard Attribution:**

Most marketers default to last-click or even multi-touch attribution models, then optimize campaigns based on that data. The issue is that these models systematically mislead you:

- **Last-click over-credits search and retargeting**: These channels capture demand created elsewhere and get full credit
- **View-through attribution is often fiction**: A display ad that appeared for 1 second before an organic purchase gets "credit"
- **Multi-touch models just spread the same bias around**: They still can't tell you what's causal

**What Actually Matters: Incrementality**

The real question isn't "what touched the customer before they converted?" It's "would this conversion have happened without this marketing spend?"

That's incrementality - measuring the true causal impact of your marketing.

**How to Measure Incrementality:**

1. **Holdout Tests (Geographic or Audience)**
   - Turn off a channel in some markets/audiences
   - Compare performance to markets where it's on
   - The difference is your true incremental impact
   - Best for channels like CTV, programmatic, brand campaigns

2. **Matched Market Tests**
   - Select similar markets, vary spend levels
   - Statistical analysis determines lift
   - More sophisticated but more accurate

3. **Conversion Lift Studies**
   - Platform-provided (Meta, Google)
   - Compare conversion rates between exposed and control groups
   - Good directional data, but platforms have incentive to show positive results

**My Recommended Framework:**

Rather than optimizing for ROAS (which is an output of attribution, not reality), focus on:

1. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: What does it actually cost to acquire a new customer? Track this rigorously, excluding retargeting which often claims credit for intent that already existed.

2. **Lifetime Value (LTV) to CAC Ratio**: A $50 CAC that yields a $200 LTV customer is better than a $20 CAC that yields a $40 LTV customer. Optimize for long-term value.

3. **Incrementality Tests**: Run periodic tests to validate that your spend is actually driving incremental outcomes, not just taking credit for organic behavior.

4. **Blended Efficiency Metrics**: Track overall marketing efficiency (total revenue / total marketing spend) alongside channel-specific metrics. If your blended number is healthy but channel metrics say you should shift budget, be skeptical.

**The ROAS Trap:**

Many marketers optimize for ROAS and end up in a trap:
- Shift budget to high-ROAS channels (search, retargeting)
- Those channels look better but are just capturing existing demand
- Upper-funnel channels that create demand get starved
- Eventually, even the "efficient" channels decline because there's no new demand to capture

**Practical Guidance:**

- Use attribution data for optimization within channels (which ads, audiences, etc.)
- Don't trust attribution for allocation decisions between channels
- Run incrementality tests quarterly on your largest budget areas
- Build a measurement culture that questions easy answers

Would you like me to go deeper on how to set up incrementality tests, or discuss how to present this framework to stakeholders who are attached to ROAS?

## EXAMPLE 6: CHANNEL MIX OPTIMIZATION

### Scenario
User wants advice on CTV vs YouTube for awareness.

### Conversation

**User:** Should I invest more in CTV or YouTube for brand awareness? What are the tradeoffs?

**MPA:** Both are strong awareness channels, but they serve different purposes. Here's how to think about the tradeoff:

**Connected TV (CTV):**

Strengths:
- Premium, brand-safe environment (your ad runs during quality content)
- High completion rates (90%+ for non-skippable)
- Big-screen, lean-back viewing (better attention than mobile)
- Growing reach as streaming adoption increases
- Can layer advanced targeting (household, behavioral, purchase data)

Weaknesses:
- Higher CPMs ($20-40 typically vs. $10-20 for YouTube)
- No click-through (TV-style experience, not interactive)
- Measurement is harder (no direct attribution, relies on lift studies)
- Frequency management across platforms is challenging
- Creative needs to be designed for big screen (production costs)

Best For:
- Brand building with affluent audiences
- Reaching cord-cutters/cord-nevers
- Categories where premium context matters (luxury, financial services, healthcare)
- When you need incremental reach beyond YouTube

**YouTube:**

Strengths:
- Massive scale and reach
- Lower CPMs, especially for skippable formats
- Targeting capabilities (intent, affinity, custom audiences)
- Direct response and awareness in one platform
- Measurable (view rates, click-through, even some conversion tracking)
- Easier creative iteration (can test more variants)

Weaknesses:
- Skippable ads mean many people skip
- User-generated content environment (less premium than CTV)
- Mobile-heavy consumption (smaller screen, divided attention)
- Brand safety requires careful management
- Competition for attention with related videos

Best For:
- Broad reach at efficient cost
- Audiences you can target by interest/intent
- When you want some direct response alongside awareness
- Categories comfortable with digital-native environments

**My Recommendation Framework:**

| Factor | Choose CTV | Choose YouTube |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| Budget | $200K+ for awareness | Any budget works |
| Audience | Premium/affluent | Mass market |
| Creative | TV-quality :30s | Multiple versions, shorter |
| Measurement priority | Lift studies okay | Need trackable metrics |
| Brand safety | Critical | Manageable |
| Goal | Pure awareness | Awareness + some DR |

**Optimal Approach: Use Both**

If budget allows, the best strategy combines both:
- YouTube for reach and efficiency (60-70% of video budget)
- CTV for premium incremental reach (30-40% of video budget)

YouTube builds your base reach efficiently. CTV adds high-attention impressions with audiences you might miss on YouTube (older demographics, premium households, lighter YouTube users).

**Budget Guidance:**

- Under $100K video budget: Focus on YouTube only
- $100K-$300K: 70% YouTube, 30% CTV
- $300K+: 60% YouTube, 40% CTV, or adjust based on audience

What's your specific situation? I can give more targeted advice if you share your budget, audience, and what you're trying to achieve.

## EXAMPLE 7: INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE

### Scenario
User asks about media planning for financial services.

### Conversation

**User:** What are the key considerations for media planning in the financial services industry?

**MPA:** Financial services has several unique characteristics that significantly impact media planning:

**Regulatory Considerations:**

This is the biggest differentiator from other industries:

- **Compliance review on all creative**: Every ad needs legal/compliance approval, which extends timelines and limits agility
- **Disclosures and disclaimers**: Required fine print affects creative format and length (15-second ads are tough with 5 seconds of disclosures)
- **Claim substantiation**: Performance claims (rates, returns, savings) need documentation
- **Platform-specific rules**: Meta, Google, and others have enhanced restrictions on financial products
- **State-by-state variation**: Some products can only be advertised in certain states

**Planning implication**: Build 2-3 weeks extra for compliance review. Create fewer creative variants but make them compliant from the start.

**Trust and Credibility:**

Financial decisions are high-stakes for consumers:

- **Brand safety is paramount**: One ad appearing next to questionable content can destroy trust
- **Premium environments preferred**: CTV, premium publishers, high-quality content targeting
- **Educational content performs well**: People want to learn, not just be sold
- **Social proof matters**: Testimonials, reviews, ratings (where compliant)
- **Repetition builds trust**: Higher frequency than impulse categories

**Planning implication**: Invest in brand-safe inventory even at higher CPMs. Content marketing and thought leadership complement paid media.

**Longer Consideration Cycles:**

Financial products aren't impulse purchases:

- **Multi-month decision timelines** for mortgages, investments, insurance
- **Multiple stakeholders** in household financial decisions
- **Research-heavy journey**: Comparison shopping, reviews, advice-seeking
- **Timing sensitivity**: Life events trigger financial decisions (home purchase, retirement, new job)

**Planning implication**: Sustained presence beats flighting. Invest in upper-funnel awareness that runs continuously, not just when you need leads.

**Channel Recommendations for Financial Services:**

**High Priority:**
- Paid Search (capture intent, but expensive - plan for $15-50+ CPCs)
- LinkedIn (B2B financial products, wealth management)
- CTV/Premium Video (brand building, trust)
- Programmatic with premium inventory (brand safety)

**Moderate Priority:**
- Meta (good for consumer financial products, requires careful compliance)
- Native/Content (education-focused approach)
- Audio/Podcast (considered environment, trust-building)

**Approach Carefully:**
- Display (brand safety concerns, but retargeting valuable)
- TikTok (younger demographics, regulatory uncertainty)
- User-generated influencer content (compliance nightmares)

**Measurement Nuances:**

- Long attribution windows needed (90+ days for mortgages, investments)
- Lead quality matters more than volume (underwriting determines actual customers)
- Offline conversions are common (branch visits, phone calls)
- Customer lifetime value can be enormous (justify higher acquisition costs)

**Typical Budget Allocation for Consumer Financial Services:**

| Channel | Allocation | Purpose |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Paid Search | 25-35% | Intent capture |
| CTV/Premium Video | 20-25% | Awareness, trust |
| Programmatic Display | 15-20% | Retargeting, awareness |
| Meta | 15-20% | Prospecting, leads |
| Audio/Podcast | 5-10% | Brand building |
| Other | 5-10% | Testing, emerging |

Would you like me to dive deeper into any specific financial product category (banking, insurance, investments, fintech)?

## EXAMPLE 8: SESSION CONTINUITY

### Scenario
User returns to continue a previous planning conversation.

### Conversation

**User:** Hi, I'm back. We talked earlier about my retail media plan. I've thought about your recommendations and have some follow-up questions.

**MPA:** Welcome back. I remember we discussed your $750K Q2 media plan for your home goods ecommerce Spring Refresh campaign. We covered a channel mix with paid search, Meta, CTV, programmatic display, and YouTube, along with a phased timing approach around your late-March sale event.

What questions do you have? I'm happy to dive deeper into any aspect of the plan.

**User:** Yes, that's right. I'm particularly interested in the CTV recommendation. My CMO is skeptical because we can't track clicks. How do I make the case?

**MPA:** This is a common conversation, and your CMO's skepticism is understandable given how most digital marketing is measured. Here's how to frame the case for CTV:

**Acknowledge the Limitation, Then Reframe:**

You're right that CTV doesn't generate click-through attribution. But frame the question differently: "The issue isn't that CTV can't prove its value - it's that our measurement approach isn't designed for awareness channels."

**The Business Case for CTV:**

1. **Your Audience is There**
   Your 30-55, HHI $100K+ audience has shifted to streaming. Linear TV reach is declining, especially for this demo. If you want video reach, CTV is increasingly where they are.

2. **Attention Quality**
   Not all impressions are equal. A 30-second, non-skippable ad on a 55" screen in a lean-back environment gets more attention than a skippable mobile ad. Studies show 2-3x higher brand recall for CTV vs. mobile video.

3. **Brand Equity Compounds**
   Your competitors who invest in brand advertising can charge premium prices and spend less on acquisition long-term. CTV builds the brand equity that makes all your other marketing more efficient.

**How to Prove CTV Value:**

Propose a structured test to your CMO:

**Geographic Holdout Test:**
- Select 30% of your markets as CTV holdout (no CTV, same other media)
- Run CTV in remaining 70% of markets
- After 6-8 weeks, compare:
  - Branded search volume (should be higher in CTV markets)
  - Direct traffic (should be higher)
  - Conversion rate on retargeting (should be higher)
  - New customer acquisition cost (should be lower)

**What "Good" Looks Like:**

For a well-executed CTV campaign, you typically see:
- 10-20% lift in branded search
- 5-15% lift in direct traffic
- Improved efficiency in lower-funnel channels
- Positive incremental return when you calculate the halo effect

**Quantifying the Business Case:**

If your $150K CTV spend (20% of budget) delivers:
- 15% lift in branded search effectiveness
- 10% lift in retargeting conversion rates
- Those downstream improvements may be worth $50K-100K in efficiency gains
- Plus brand equity that compounds over time

**What to Tell Your CMO:**

"I recommend we test CTV with a geographic holdout. This will give us actual incrementality data rather than debating attribution models. If CTV doesn't show lift in our downstream metrics, we'll cut it. If it does, we'll have evidence to scale it. Either way, we'll know more than we do now."

Would you like me to help design the specific test methodology, or prepare a one-page summary for your CMO?

## EXAMPLE 9: ERROR HANDLING - INVALID INPUT

### Scenario
User provides incomplete or unusual information.

### Conversation

**User:** Create a media plan with $50.

**MPA:** I appreciate the straightforward ask, but $50 is a challenging budget for a meaningful media plan. At that level, most advertising platforms have minimum spend requirements that would consume the entire budget.

Let me offer a few options depending on your situation:

**If This is a Test/Learning Exercise:**
I'm happy to walk through how a media plan would be structured conceptually, even if $50 isn't a realistic budget. We can discuss channel selection, targeting, measurement, and strategy as educational content.

**If You Have a Very Limited Budget (Under $1,000):**
For very small budgets, I'd recommend:
- Focus on a single channel (typically Meta or Google Ads)
- Target very specific, high-intent audience
- Set realistic expectations (brand awareness at this scale is difficult)
- Consider if organic content or other marketing approaches might be more effective

**If You Meant $50,000:**
That's a workable budget for many campaigns. We could build a solid plan with $50K - just confirm the amount and share some context about your business and goals.

**If You're Exploring What's Possible:**
Tell me more about what you're trying to achieve. Budget is important, but sometimes there are creative solutions for resource-constrained situations.

What's your actual situation? I want to make sure I provide useful guidance.

**User:** Sorry, I meant $50,000 for Q1. We're a B2B SaaS startup.

**MPA:** No problem - $50K for Q1 is a solid starting budget for a B2B SaaS startup. Now I can help.

A few questions to shape the right approach:

- What does your product do, and who's your ideal customer (title, company size, industry)?
- What's your primary goal - lead generation, trial signups, demo requests, or awareness?
- What's your average contract value and typical sales cycle?
- Are you currently running any marketing, or starting from scratch?

With $50K quarterly, we'll need to be focused rather than spread thin, so understanding your specific situation will help me recommend the right approach.

## EXAMPLE 10: DOCUMENT GENERATION

### Scenario
User requests a formal media plan document.

### Conversation

**User:** Based on everything we've discussed about my retail campaign, can you generate a formal media plan document I can share with my team?

**MPA:** I can help you create a media plan document. Based on our discussion about your $750K Q2 home goods ecommerce campaign for the Spring Refresh event, here's what I can include:

**Proposed Document Structure:**

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Campaign overview and objectives
   - Total budget and timeline
   - Key strategic recommendations

2. **Situation Analysis**
   - Business context (mid-size home goods ecommerce)
   - Target audience definition (homeowners 30-55, HHI $100K+)
   - Campaign goals (balance awareness and sales)

3. **Strategic Approach**
   - Dual-objective strategy rationale
   - Phased timing around Spring Refresh sale
   - New customer acquisition + lapsed customer reactivation

4. **Channel Strategy**
   - Paid Search: $225K (30%) - intent capture
   - Meta: $187.5K (25%) - prospecting and retargeting
   - CTV: $150K (20%) - awareness and brand building
   - Programmatic: $112.5K (15%) - retargeting layer
   - YouTube: $75K (10%) - video awareness

5. **Media Calendar**
   - Pre-sale phase (weeks 1-4): Awareness emphasis
   - Sale event (weeks 5-8): Conversion emphasis
   - Post-sale (weeks 9-12): Balanced mix

6. **Measurement Framework**
   - Primary KPIs: New customer acquisition cost, reactivation rate
   - Secondary KPIs: ROAS, brand lift
   - Incrementality testing plan (CTV holdout)

7. **Budget Summary**
   - Channel allocation table
   - Phasing by month
   - Contingency recommendations

8. **Next Steps**
   - Creative development requirements
   - Platform setup and trafficking
   - Reporting cadence

**To Generate the Document:**

I can create this document for you. Would you like me to:

A) Generate a comprehensive document with all sections filled in based on our discussion

B) Generate a template with structure and placeholders where you'll add specifics

C) Focus on specific sections (e.g., just the executive summary and channel strategy)

Also, let me know if there are any specific elements you want to add, remove, or modify from the structure above.

**User:** Option A please - the comprehensive version.

**MPA:** I'll generate the comprehensive media plan document now. This will include all sections with specific details from our conversation.

[Document generation initiated]

The document will be formatted as a professional media plan including:
- Detailed rationale for each recommendation
- Specific budget allocations and timing
- Benchmark expectations by channel
- Clear success metrics and measurement approach

Once generated, you'll be able to download it and customize any sections for your internal presentation. The document should be ready in a moment.

Would you like me to include any additional context specific to your company or stakeholders that would make this more compelling for internal buy-in?

## ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID IN DEMOS

When demonstrating MPA, avoid these scenarios that may not showcase the agent well:

**Technical Limitations:**
- Asking for real-time competitive intelligence (MPA doesn't have live market data)
- Requesting specific platform API integrations or automated campaign deployment
- Asking for highly specific local market data (benchmarks are industry-level)

**Out of Scope:**
- Creative development or ad copy writing (MPA is for strategy and planning)
- Media buying or negotiation tactics
- Highly technical attribution modeling or data science
- Legal or compliance advice on advertising regulations

**Edge Cases:**
- Very small budgets (under $10K) where channel options are limited
- Highly specialized industries without benchmark data
- Requests for guaranteed performance predictions

**Response Quality:**
- Extremely vague questions without context ("What should I do?")
- Questions that require clarification but user won't provide details
- Rapid-fire questions that don't allow for conversational depth

**For Best Demo Results:**
- Use realistic budgets ($50K-$5M range)
- Provide industry/audience context
- Allow for conversational back-and-forth
- Ask about strategy and planning, not execution
- Focus on areas where MPA's knowledge base shines (measurement, channel mix, budget allocation)
