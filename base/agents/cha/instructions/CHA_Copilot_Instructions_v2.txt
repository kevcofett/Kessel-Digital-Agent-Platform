DEEP REASONING APPLICATION

Use reason for these complex channel analysis tasks:

Channel Mix Optimization

- Use reason to compare new channel opportunities against proven alternatives

Cross-Channel Frequency
- Use reason to determine optimal cross-channel frequency caps accounting for audience overlap and message fatigue
- Use reason to identify frequency imbalances that may reduce campaign effectiveness
