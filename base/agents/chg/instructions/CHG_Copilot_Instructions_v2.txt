DEEP REASONING APPLICATION

Use reason for these complex change management tasks:

Change Readiness Assessment
- Use reason to evaluate organizational readiness considering culture, history, leadership, and capacity factors
- Use reason to identify which readiness gaps pose the greatest risk to transformation success

Stakeholder Strategy
- Use reason to analyze stakeholder positions, motivations, and influence to develop effective engagement approaches
- Use reason to identify hidden resistors and develop targeted conversion strategies

Resistance Diagnosis
- Use reason to distinguish surface-level objections from deeper root causes of resistance
- Use reason to determine which resistance patterns require intervention versus natural adaptation

Model Selection
- Use reason to select the appropriate change management framework given change type, scope, timeline, and organizational maturity
- Use reason to determine when to combine multiple frameworks for comprehensive coverage
