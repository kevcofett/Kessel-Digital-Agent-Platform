LAST UPDATED JANUARY 2026

---

OVERVIEW

This document contains 7 advanced frameworks for financial analysis, investment decisions, and business case development. These frameworks help evaluate opportunities, quantify value, and justify strategic investments.

---

FRAMEWORK BC-01: TCO ANALYSIS

TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP

PURPOSE
Evaluate the complete lifecycle cost of an investment including hidden and indirect costs.

WHEN TO USE
- Technology vendor selection
- Build vs buy decisions
- Long-term infrastructure investments
- Software platform evaluation

METHODOLOGY

Step 1 - Identify Cost Categories
- Acquisition costs: Purchase price, implementation, training
- Operating costs: Maintenance, support, licensing, hosting
- Hidden costs: Integration, customization, downtime, opportunity cost
- End-of-life costs: Migration, decommissioning, data transfer

Step 2 - Establish Time Horizon
- Typical range: 3-5 years for technology
- Match to asset useful life
- Consider contract terms and renewal cycles

Step 3 - Quantify Each Cost Element
- Use vendor quotes for direct costs
- Estimate internal labor at fully loaded rates
- Include contingency for unknowns (10-20%)

Step 4 - Calculate Present Value
- Apply discount rate (typically WACC or hurdle rate)
- Sum discounted costs across time horizon

OUTPUT FORMAT
- Cost breakdown by category and year
- Total TCO and TCO per user/unit
- Sensitivity analysis on key assumptions
- Comparison matrix if evaluating alternatives

FRAMEWORK BC-02: NPV IRR DECISION FRAMEWORK

NET PRESENT VALUE AND INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN

PURPOSE
Evaluate investment attractiveness using discounted cash flow analysis.

WHEN TO USE
- Capital expenditure decisions
- Project prioritization
- Strategic initiative funding
- Acquisition evaluation

METHODOLOGY

Step 1 - Project Cash Flows
- Year 0: Initial investment (negative)
- Years 1-N: Operating cash flows
- Terminal year: Salvage value or terminal value

Step 2 - Determine Discount Rate
- Use WACC for company-funded projects
- Use hurdle rate for risk-adjusted analysis
- Consider project-specific risk premiums

Step 3 - Calculate NPV
- NPV = Sum of (Cash Flow / (1 + r)^t) for all periods
- Positive NPV indicates value creation
- Higher NPV preferred among alternatives

Step 4 - Calculate IRR
- IRR = Rate where NPV equals zero
- Compare IRR to hurdle rate
- IRR greater than hurdle indicates acceptable return

DECISION RULES
- NPV greater than 0: Accept
- NPV less than 0: Reject
- IRR greater than hurdle rate: Accept
- For mutually exclusive projects: Choose highest NPV

LIMITATIONS
- Assumes reinvestment at discount rate (NPV) or IRR
- Sensitive to terminal value assumptions
- Does not capture strategic optionality

FRAMEWORK BC-03: REAL OPTIONS ANALYSIS

STRATEGIC FLEXIBILITY VALUATION

PURPOSE
Value the flexibility to make future decisions as uncertainty resolves.

WHEN TO USE
- Phased investments with decision points
- R&D and innovation projects
- Market entry timing decisions
- Platform investments with expansion potential

OPTION TYPES

Option to Expand
- Right to scale up if initial results positive
- Value increases with uncertainty and growth potential

Option to Abandon
- Right to exit and recover salvage value
- Valuable when downside risk is high

Option to Defer
- Right to wait for more information
- Valuable in volatile or uncertain markets

Option to Switch
- Flexibility to change inputs or outputs
- Valuable in markets with price volatility

METHODOLOGY

Step 1 - Identify Embedded Options
- Map decision points in project timeline
- Identify what decisions could be made at each point

Step 2 - Model Uncertainty
- Define key uncertain variables
- Estimate volatility or range of outcomes

Step 3 - Value Options
- Simplified: Decision tree with probabilities
- Advanced: Black-Scholes or binomial models

Step 4 - Add Option Value to Base NPV
- Total value = NPV + Option value
- May justify projects with negative base NPV

FRAMEWORK BC-04: OPPORTUNITY COST FRAMEWORK

NEXT BEST ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS

PURPOSE
Quantify the value foregone by choosing one option over alternatives.

WHEN TO USE
- Resource allocation decisions
- Strategic prioritization
- Capital budgeting with constraints
- Time allocation for key resources

METHODOLOGY

Step 1 - Define the Decision
- What resources are being allocated
- What are the constraints
- What is the decision timeframe

Step 2 - Identify Alternatives
- List all feasible options
- Include status quo as baseline
- Consider creative alternatives

Step 3 - Value Each Alternative
- Use consistent valuation method
- Quantify both financial and strategic value
- Document assumptions

Step 4 - Calculate Opportunity Cost
- Opportunity cost = Value of best foregone alternative
- True cost of chosen option = Direct cost + Opportunity cost

APPLICATION GUIDANCE
- Always make opportunity cost explicit in business cases
- Revisit when new alternatives emerge
- Consider both short-term and long-term opportunity costs

FRAMEWORK BC-05: RISK ADJUSTED RETURN MODEL

INCORPORATING RISK INTO INVESTMENT ANALYSIS

PURPOSE
Adjust expected returns for project-specific risk to enable fair comparison.

WHEN TO USE
- Comparing projects with different risk profiles
- Portfolio investment decisions
- Setting risk-appropriate hurdle rates
- Venture and innovation investments

METHODOLOGY

Step 1 - Assess Project Risk Factors
- Market risk: Demand uncertainty, competitive dynamics
- Technical risk: Feasibility, execution complexity
- Operational risk: Integration, change management
- Financial risk: Currency, interest rate, funding

Step 2 - Quantify Risk Impact
- Probability-weighted scenarios
- Monte Carlo simulation for complex cases
- Expert judgment calibrated to historical outcomes

Step 3 - Calculate Risk-Adjusted Metrics
- Certainty equivalent: Risk-free value of uncertain outcome
- Risk-adjusted discount rate: Higher rate for riskier projects
- Expected shortfall: Average loss in worst cases

Step 4 - Compare Risk-Adjusted Returns
- Use consistent risk adjustment method across projects
- Consider both return and risk in portfolio context

RISK PREMIUM GUIDELINES
- Low risk (proven technology, stable market): +1-2%
- Medium risk (new market, established technology): +3-5%
- High risk (new technology, new market): +6-10%
- Very high risk (breakthrough innovation): +10-20%

FRAMEWORK BC-06: ECONOMIC VALUE ADDED

EVA ANALYSIS

PURPOSE
Measure true economic profit after accounting for cost of all capital employed.

WHEN TO USE
- Business unit performance evaluation
- Investment decision making
- Management incentive design
- Value creation tracking

FORMULA
EVA = NOPAT - (Capital Employed x WACC)

Where:
- NOPAT = Net Operating Profit After Tax
- Capital Employed = Total assets minus non-interest bearing liabilities
- WACC = Weighted Average Cost of Capital

METHODOLOGY

Step 1 - Calculate NOPAT
- Start with operating income
- Add back interest expense (tax-adjusted)
- Subtract cash taxes

Step 2 - Determine Capital Employed
- Total assets
- Minus accounts payable and accrued liabilities
- Equals capital employed

Step 3 - Calculate Capital Charge
- Capital employed x WACC
- Represents minimum return required by investors

Step 4 - Compute EVA
- Positive EVA indicates value creation
- Negative EVA indicates value destruction
- Track EVA trend over time

INTERPRETATION
- EVA greater than 0: Creating value above cost of capital
- EVA equals 0: Meeting but not exceeding required return
- EVA less than 0: Destroying shareholder value

FRAMEWORK BC-07: PAYBACK AND BREAK EVEN

LIQUIDITY AND RECOVERY ANALYSIS

PURPOSE
Determine when an investment recovers its initial cost and begins generating positive returns.

WHEN TO USE
- Cash-constrained environments
- High-risk projects requiring quick recovery
- Comparing alternatives with different cash flow timing
- Setting milestones for staged investments

PAYBACK PERIOD

Simple Payback
- Time to recover initial investment
- Ignores time value of money
- Formula: Initial investment / Annual cash flow

Discounted Payback
- Time to recover initial investment in present value terms
- Accounts for time value of money
- More conservative than simple payback

BREAK EVEN ANALYSIS

Unit Break Even
- Units required to cover fixed costs
- Formula: Fixed costs / (Price - Variable cost per unit)

Revenue Break Even
- Revenue required to cover all costs
- Formula: Fixed costs / Contribution margin ratio

Time Break Even
- Months or years to reach profitability
- Incorporates ramp-up assumptions

METHODOLOGY

Step 1 - Identify Fixed and Variable Costs
- Fixed: Do not change with volume
- Variable: Change proportionally with volume

Step 2 - Calculate Contribution Margin
- Price minus variable cost per unit
- Or contribution margin ratio for revenue analysis

Step 3 - Compute Break Even Point
- Fixed costs / Contribution margin

Step 4 - Assess Feasibility
- Compare break even to market size
- Evaluate time to break even against cash reserves
- Sensitivity test key assumptions

DECISION GUIDELINES
- Payback within 2-3 years preferred for most investments
- Break even within 18-24 months for new products
- Adjust thresholds based on industry and risk profile
