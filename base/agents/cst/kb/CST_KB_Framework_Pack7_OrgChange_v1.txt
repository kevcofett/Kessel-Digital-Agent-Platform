FRAMEWORK OC-03: ADKAR MODEL

INDIVIDUAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT

PURPOSE
Address the personal journey individuals go through during change.

WHEN TO USE
- Any change requiring individual behavior change
- Diagnosing resistance
- Designing targeted interventions
- Measuring change progress

THE FIVE ELEMENTS

A - Awareness
- Understanding why change is needed
- Barrier: Comfort with status quo, lack of information
- Enabler: Clear communication, compelling case

D - Desire
- Personal motivation to support change
- Barrier: Fear, skepticism, competing priorities
- Enabler: WIIFM messaging, involvement, incentives

K - Knowledge
- Understanding how to change
- Barrier: Complexity, inadequate training
- Enabler: Education, job aids, coaching

A - Ability
- Demonstrating new skills and behaviors
- Barrier: Habits, environment, capability gaps
- Enabler: Practice, feedback, removal of barriers

R - Reinforcement
- Sustaining the change over time
- Barrier: Lack of accountability, old rewards
- Enabler: Recognition, measurement, consequences

METHODOLOGY

Step 1 - Assess Current State
- Survey or interview to determine where individuals are
- Identify which element is the barrier point
- Segment population by barrier point

Step 2 - Design Targeted Interventions
- Awareness issues: Communication campaigns
- Desire issues: Sponsorship, involvement, incentives
- Knowledge issues: Training, documentation
- Ability issues: Coaching, practice, environment changes
- Reinforcement issues: Measurement, recognition, accountability

Step 3 - Implement Sequentially
- Cannot skip elements
- Earlier elements enable later ones
- Address barrier point before moving forward

Step 4 - Measure Progress
- Re-assess periodically
- Track movement through elements
- Adjust interventions based on results

FRAMEWORK OC-04: BURKE LITWIN MODEL

ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE DYNAMICS

PURPOSE
Understand cause-and-effect relationships between organizational factors and performance.

WHEN TO USE
- Diagnosing organizational performance issues
- Planning comprehensive transformation
- Understanding change impact pathways
- Research and academic analysis

MODEL STRUCTURE

External Environment (Driver)
- Industry conditions, regulations, competition
- Changes here trigger internal adaptation

Transformational Factors (Deep change)
- Mission and Strategy: Purpose and direction
- Leadership: Executive behaviors and decisions
- Organizational Culture: Norms and values

- Organizational performance

CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS

Top-Down Influence
- Environment influences mission and strategy
- Leadership shapes culture
- Culture influences climate
- Climate affects individual performance

Bottom-Up Feedback
- Performance data informs strategy
- Individual needs influence climate
- Climate signals surface to leadership

DIAGNOSTIC APPLICATION

Step 1 - Assess External Environment
- What changes are occurring
- How do they impact the organization

Step 2 - Evaluate Transformational Factors
- Is strategy aligned to environment
- Is leadership modeling desired behaviors
- Is culture enabling or inhibiting

Step 3 - Examine Transactional Factors
- Are structures appropriate
- Do systems support strategy
- Is climate positive

Step 4 - Connect to Performance

FRAMEWORK OC-05: LEWIN CHANGE MODEL

THREE-STAGE CHANGE PROCESS

PURPOSE
Provide fundamental model for understanding and managing change transitions.

WHEN TO USE
- Any organizational change initiative
- Foundation for more detailed change models
- Teaching change management concepts
- Simple change planning

THE THREE STAGES

Stage 1 - Unfreeze
- Prepare organization to accept change
- Challenge current state and create discomfort
- Overcome resistance and denial
- Build readiness for change

Unfreezing Tactics
- Communicate why change is needed
- Challenge assumptions and sacred cows
- Create psychological safety for exploration
- Involve people in defining the problem

Stage 2 - Change (Transition)
- Implement new ways of working
- Period of confusion and uncertainty
- Learning curve and reduced productivity
- Requires active support and guidance

Transition Tactics
- Clear vision of end state
- Training and skill development
- Coaching and support

- Align rewards and recognition
- Update policies and procedures
- Celebrate successes
- Remove old systems and artifacts
- Hire and promote aligned individuals

FORCE FIELD ANALYSIS

Complementary Tool
- Identify forces driving change (pro)
- Identify forces restraining change (con)
- Weigh relative strength of each
- Strategy: Strengthen drivers or reduce restrainers

Application
- List driving forces with strength rating
- List restraining forces with strength rating
- Total each side
- Develop actions to shift balance

- Honor the past and its contributions
- Allow time and space for grieving
- Be empathetic but firm on direction

Phase 2 - Neutral Zone

- Also opportunity for creativity and innovation

Managing Neutral Zone
- Normalize the discomfort
- Provide temporary structures and goals
- Encourage experimentation
- Increase communication frequency
- Create short-term wins

Phase 3 - New Beginnings
- Embracing the new way
- New identity, competence, relationships
