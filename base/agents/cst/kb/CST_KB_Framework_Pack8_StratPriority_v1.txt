---

OVERVIEW

This document contains 8 frameworks for strategic planning, goal setting, and initiative prioritization. These frameworks help organizations set direction, allocate resources, and sequence work effectively.

FRAMEWORK SP-01: OKRs

OBJECTIVES AND KEY RESULTS

PURPOSE
Align and engage teams around measurable goals that drive strategic outcomes.

WHEN TO USE
- Quarterly and annual goal setting
- Cascading strategy through organization
- Tracking progress on strategic priorities
- Creating focus and accountability

STRUCTURE

Objectives
- Qualitative, inspirational goals
- What you want to achieve
- Ambitious but achievable
- Typically 3-5 per team per quarter

Key Results
- Quantitative measures of progress
- How you know you achieved the objective
- Specific, measurable, time-bound
- Typically 2-4 per objective

METHODOLOGY

Step 1 - Set Company Objectives
- Leadership defines top priorities
- Connect to mission and strategy
- Limit to 3-5 for focus

Step 2 - Define Key Results
- Make measurable and specific
- Set ambitious targets (70% achievement is success)
- Include mix of leading and lagging indicators

Step 3 - Cascade Through Organization
- Teams create supporting OKRs
- Alignment up, autonomy on how
- Cross-functional dependencies identified

Step 4 - Track and Review
- Weekly check-ins on progress
- Quarterly scoring and reflection
- Adjust as needed, learn from misses

SCORING APPROACH
- 0.0-0.3: Failed to make progress
- 0.4-0.6: Made progress but fell short
- 0.7-0.9: Delivered (target zone)
- 1.0: Fully achieved (may indicate not ambitious enough)

EXAMPLE

Objective: Become the preferred partner for enterprise clients

Key Results:
- Increase enterprise NPS from 42 to 55
- Grow enterprise revenue from $10M to $15M

FRAMEWORK SP-03: VRIO ANALYSIS

RESOURCE-BASED COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

PURPOSE
Evaluate internal resources and capabilities for sustainable competitive advantage.

WHEN TO USE
- Identifying competitive advantages
- Resource allocation decisions
- Capability development planning
- Strategic positioning

VRIO CRITERIA

V - Valuable
- Does the resource enable value creation
- Does it exploit opportunities or neutralize threats
- If not valuable: Competitive disadvantage

R - Rare
- Is it controlled by only a few competitors
- If valuable but not rare: Competitive parity

I - Inimitable
- Is it costly to obtain or develop
- Is it protected by history, complexity, or ambiguity
- If valuable, rare, but imitable: Temporary advantage

O - Organized
- Is the organization set up to capture value
- Right processes, policies, structure
- If valuable, rare, inimitable, but not organized: Unrealized potential

METHODOLOGY

Step 1 - Identify Resources and Capabilities
- Tangible: Physical, financial, technological
- Intangible: Brand, culture, knowledge, relationships

FRAMEWORK SP-06: MoSCoW PRIORITIZATION

REQUIREMENT AND INITIATIVE CLASSIFICATION

PURPOSE
Prioritize requirements or initiatives into categories to focus effort and manage scope.

WHEN TO USE
- Product backlog prioritization
- Project scope management
- Resource allocation
- Stakeholder negotiation

THE FOUR CATEGORIES

Must Have
- Non-negotiable requirements
- Without these, solution is not viable
- Core functionality or compliance needs
- Typically 60% or less of effort

Should Have
- Important but not vital
- Painful if missing but workarounds exist
- Second priority after Must Have
- Typically 20% of effort

Could Have
- Nice to have if time and resources permit
- Desirable but not necessary
- First to be descoped under pressure
- Typically 20% of effort

Won't Have (this time)
- Explicitly out of scope
- May be considered for future
- Important for expectation management
- Prevents scope creep

METHODOLOGY

Step 1 - List All Items
- Requirements, features, initiatives
- Consistent level of granularity

Step 2 - Classify Each Item
- Work through with stakeholders
- Use definitions strictly
- Challenge everything claimed as Must

Step 3 - Validate Must Haves
- If Must Have exceeds 60%, revisit
- Ask: Will solution fail without this
- Be rigorous

Step 4 - Sequence Delivery
- Must Have first
- Should Have next
- Could Have if time permits

TIPS FOR EFFECTIVE USE
- Define what failure means clearly
- Timebox the classification exercise
- Revisit as context changes
- Document rationale for key decisions

FRAMEWORK SP-07: RICE SCORING

INITIATIVE PRIORITIZATION MODEL

PURPOSE
Score and rank initiatives objectively using consistent criteria.

WHEN TO USE
- Product roadmap prioritization
- Project portfolio decisions
- Feature prioritization
- Resource allocation

RICE COMPONENTS

R - Reach
- How many people will be impacted
- In a defined time period
- Quantify: Users, customers, transactions

I - Impact
- How much will each person be impacted
- Scale: Massive (3), High (2), Medium (1), Low (0.5), Minimal (0.25)
- Estimate conservatively

C - Confidence
- How confident are you in estimates
- Scale: High (100%), Medium (80%), Low (50%)
- Reflects uncertainty in other factors

E - Effort
- Work required to complete
- Measured in person-months or story points
- Include all work: Design, development, testing

FORMULA
RICE Score = (Reach x Impact x Confidence) / Effort

METHODOLOGY

Step 1 - Define Initiatives
- Consistent scope and definition
- Clear enough to estimate

Step 2 - Estimate Each Factor
- Use data where available
- Apply judgment consistently
- Document assumptions

Step 3 - Calculate Scores
- Apply formula
- Rank by score

Step 4 - Review and Adjust
- Sense check rankings
- Consider dependencies
- Factor in strategic alignment

EXAMPLE

Initiative: Mobile app redesign
- Reach: 50,000 users per quarter
- Impact: High (2)
- Confidence: Medium (80%)
- Effort: 3 person-months

RICE = (50,000 x 2 x 0.8) / 3 = 26,667

FRAMEWORK SP-08: WEIGHTED DECISION MATRIX

MULTI-CRITERIA DECISION ANALYSIS

PURPOSE
Evaluate alternatives against multiple criteria with appropriate weighting.

WHEN TO USE
- Vendor selection
- Technology decisions
- Location selection
- Any multi-criteria decision

METHODOLOGY

Step 1 - Define Alternatives
- Options being evaluated
- Mutually exclusive choices
- Feasible options only

Step 2 - Identify Criteria
- Factors that matter for decision
- Mix of quantitative and qualitative
- Comprehensive but not excessive

Step 3 - Assign Weights
- Relative importance of each criterion
- Sum to 100% or use 1-10 scale
- Gain consensus on weights first

Step 4 - Score Alternatives
- Rate each alternative on each criterion
- Use consistent scale (1-5 or 1-10)
- Can use benchmarks or absolute targets

Step 5 - Calculate Weighted Scores
- Multiply score by weight for each criterion
- Sum weighted scores for each alternative
- Rank by total weighted score

Step 6 - Sensitivity Analysis
- Test how changes in weights affect result
- Identify criteria where small changes flip decision
- Build confidence in decision

TEMPLATE STRUCTURE

Criteria | Weight | Option A | Option B | Option C
Cost | 30% | 4 | 3 | 5
Quality | 25% | 5 | 4 | 3
Speed | 20% | 3 | 5 | 4
Support | 15% | 4 | 3 | 4
Risk | 10% | 3 | 4 | 4
Weighted Total | 100% | 3.95 | 3.75 | 4.00

TIPS
- Get weights before seeing alternatives
- Use odd number scale to avoid middle clustering
- Document scoring rationale
- Revisit if new information emerges
