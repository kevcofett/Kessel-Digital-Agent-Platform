---

OVERVIEW

This document contains 7 frameworks for structured problem solving, root cause analysis, and hypothesis-driven thinking. These frameworks help consultants and teams systematically diagnose and solve complex business problems.

---

FRAMEWORK PS-01: MECE PRINCIPLE

MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE COLLECTIVELY EXHAUSTIVE

PURPOSE
Structure thinking and communication to ensure complete, non-overlapping analysis.

WHEN TO USE
- Structuring any analysis
- Defining problem scope
- Creating presentation frameworks
- Organizing research

CORE CONCEPTS

Mutually Exclusive
- Categories do not overlap
- Each element belongs to only one category
- No double counting

Collectively Exhaustive
- Categories cover all possibilities
- Nothing is left out
- Complete picture

METHODOLOGY

Step 1 - Define the Whole
- What are you trying to segment or analyze
- Clear boundaries

Step 2 - Create First Level Breakdown
- Choose dimension for segmentation
- Ensure no overlaps
- Verify completeness

Step 3 - Validate MECE
- Test each item: Does it fit in exactly one category
- Test completeness: What could be missing
- Refine until clean

Step 4 - Add Sub-levels as Needed
- Each sub-level should also be MECE
- Stop when actionable or at appropriate detail

COMMON MECE STRUCTURES

By Process
- Inputs, Process, Outputs
- Plan, Execute, Monitor

By Stakeholder
- Customers, Employees, Shareholders, Partners
- Internal, External

By Time
- Short-term, Medium-term, Long-term
- Historical, Current, Future

By Segment
- Region: North, South, East, West
- Size: Small, Medium, Large

Profitability
- Revenue minus Costs
- (Price x Volume) minus (Fixed plus Variable)

TESTING MECE
- Can any item fit in more than one bucket? (Overlap)
- Can you think of something that fits nowhere? (Gap)
- If either yes, restructure

FRAMEWORK PS-02: ISSUE TREES

LOGICAL PROBLEM DECOMPOSITION

PURPOSE
Break complex problems into smaller, manageable components through logical hierarchy.

WHEN TO USE
- Problem diagnosis
- Hypothesis generation
- Work planning
- Communication of analysis

STRUCTURE

Root Node
- The core question or problem
- Framed as a question or statement

Branches
- MECE decomposition of root
- Each level breaks down the level above
- Continue until actionable

Leaves
- Terminal nodes that can be analyzed
- Specific enough for research or analysis

TYPES OF ISSUE TREES

Diagnostic (Why)
- Root: Why is profit declining
- Level 2: Revenue declining, Costs increasing
- Level 3 (Revenue): Price down, Volume down
- Level 3 (Cost): Fixed up, Variable up

Solution (How)
- Root: How can we increase profit
- Level 2: Increase revenue, Decrease costs
- Level 3 (Revenue): Raise price, Increase volume
- Level 3 (Cost): Reduce fixed, Reduce variable

METHODOLOGY

Step 1 - Frame the Question
- Clear, specific, answerable
- Single question or problem

Step 2 - Identify First Breaks
- MECE decomposition
- Usually 2-4 branches
- Logic-driven, not brainstorm

Step 3 - Continue Breaking Down
- Each branch becomes new question
- Stop when analysis can proceed
- Typically 3-4 levels

Step 4 - Prioritize Branches
- Which branches are most likely
- Which have biggest impact
- Focus resources on priority branches

Step 5 - Analyze and Synthesize
- Research priority branches
- Draw conclusions
- Roll up to answer root question

FRAMEWORK PS-03: HYPOTHESIS-DRIVEN APPROACH

CONSULTING PROBLEM SOLVING METHOD

PURPOSE
Accelerate problem solving by starting with answer hypothesis and testing.

WHEN TO USE
- Time-constrained projects
- Complex business problems
- When patterns are recognizable
- Expert-level problem solving

CORE CONCEPT

Traditional Approach
- Gather data
- Analyze data
- Draw conclusions
- Slow, exhaustive

Hypothesis-Driven Approach
- Form hypothesis
- Design tests
- Gather targeted data
- Confirm or refute
- Fast, focused

METHODOLOGY

Step 1 - Structure the Problem
- Use issue tree
- Identify key questions

Step 2 - Form Hypotheses
- Educated guess at answer
- Based on experience, patterns, initial data
- For each key question

Step 3 - Design Tests
- What data would prove or disprove hypothesis
- Minimum viable analysis
- Quick tests first

Step 4 - Gather Evidence
- Focused data collection
- Only what is needed to test
- Stop when hypothesis confirmed or refuted

Step 5 - Synthesize and Iterate
- If confirmed: Move to implications
- If refuted: Form new hypothesis
- Repeat until confident

HYPOTHESIS QUALITIES
- Specific enough to test
- Actionable if true
- Based on logic and evidence
- Falsifiable

EXAMPLE

Problem: Why is customer satisfaction declining

Hypothesis: Satisfaction is declining because response time has increased

Test: Compare response time trends with satisfaction trends

Result: Response time flat, satisfaction still declining

New Hypothesis: Satisfaction declining due to product quality issues

FRAMEWORK PS-04: 5 WHYS ANALYSIS

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFICATION

PURPOSE
Drill down to the root cause of a problem by asking why repeatedly.

WHEN TO USE
- Simple to moderately complex problems
- Quality issues
- Process failures
- Quick root cause analysis

METHODOLOGY

Step 1 - State the Problem
- Specific, observable problem
- Not already a cause

Step 2 - Ask Why (First Level)
- Why did this happen
- Identify immediate cause

Step 3 - Ask Why Again
- Why did the first cause happen
- Go deeper

Step 4 - Continue Asking Why
- Typically 5 times, but varies
- Stop when you reach actionable root cause
- Stop when you reach organizational control

Step 5 - Identify Root Cause
- The cause you can actually address
- Fixing this prevents recurrence

EXAMPLE

Problem: The machine stopped

Why 1: The fuse blew
Why 2: The bearing overheated
Why 3: There was not enough lubrication
Why 4: The lubricator was not working
Why 5: The lubricator pump was clogged with metal shavings

Root Cause: No filter on lubricator pump
Solution: Add filter to lubricator pump

TIPS
- Five is a guideline, not a rule
- May need multiple branches (multiple causes)
- Stay focused on controllable causes
- Avoid blame, focus on system
- Validate each why with evidence

COMMON PITFALLS
- Stopping too early at symptoms
- Jumping to conclusions
- Single linear path when multiple causes exist
- Blame rather than system focus

FRAMEWORK PS-05: PARETO ANALYSIS

80/20 RULE APPLICATION

PURPOSE
Focus effort on the vital few factors that drive most of the impact.

WHEN TO USE
- Prioritization decisions
- Quality improvement
- Resource allocation
- Any analysis with uneven distribution

CORE PRINCIPLE

The Pareto Principle
- Roughly 80% of effects come from 20% of causes
- Vital few versus trivial many
- Focus on high-impact areas

METHODOLOGY

Step 1 - Identify Problem or Opportunity
- What are you trying to improve or understand
- Clear metric of interest

Step 2 - List Contributing Factors
- All possible causes or categories
- Comprehensive list

Step 3 - Measure Each Factor
- Quantify impact or contribution
- Use consistent units

Step 4 - Rank by Impact
- Sort from highest to lowest
- Calculate cumulative percentage

Step 5 - Identify Vital Few
- Draw line at 80% cumulative impact
- These are priority focus areas

Step 6 - Focus Resources
- Address vital few first
- May achieve 80% improvement with 20% effort

PARETO CHART
- Bar chart sorted by frequency or impact
- Cumulative line showing percentage
- Visual identification of vital few

EXAMPLE

Customer Complaints Analysis
1. Late delivery: 45%
2. Product defects: 25%
3. Billing errors: 12%
4. Poor communication: 8%
5. Packaging issues: 5%
6. Other: 5%

Vital Few: Late delivery and product defects (70% of complaints)
Focus improvement efforts here first

APPLICATIONS
- Revenue by customer (focus on top customers)
- Defects by cause (address top causes)
- Time spent by activity (optimize time-consuming tasks)
- Costs by category (reduce major cost drivers)

FACILITATION TIPS
- Use cross-functional team
- One category at a time
- No judgment during brainstorm
- Build on others ideas
- Aim for depth, not just breadth

- Stakeholder analysis
- Implementation planning

CORE CONCEPT

Driving Forces
- Factors pushing toward desired change
- Reasons to change
- Benefits and opportunities

Restraining Forces
- Factors resisting change
- Barriers and obstacles
- Risks and costs

Equilibrium
- Current state balanced between forces
- Change requires shifting balance
- Strengthen drivers or weaken restrainers

METHODOLOGY

Step 1 - Define Current and Desired State
- Where are we now
- Where do we want to be

Step 2 - Identify Driving Forces
- Why should we change
- What supports the change
- Rate strength (1-5)

Step 3 - Identify Restraining Forces
- What obstacles exist
- Who or what will resist
- Rate strength (1-5)

Step 4 - Analyze Balance
- Sum driving forces
- Sum restraining forces
- Assess overall feasibility

Step 5 - Develop Strategy
- Option A: Strengthen driving forces
- Option B: Weaken restraining forces
- Option C: Both
- Usually easier to reduce restrainers

Step 6 - Create Action Plan
- Specific actions for priority forces
- Assign ownership
- Monitor progress

DIAGRAM FORMAT

Driving Forces | Change Goal | Restraining Forces
---------------|-------------|-------------------
Cost savings [4] <--> [3] Implementation cost
Competitive pressure [5] <--> [4] Employee resistance
Customer demand [3] <--> [2] Technical complexity
Leadership support [5] <--> [3] Change fatigue

Total: 17 | | Total: 12
Net: +5 (Favorable)

STRATEGIC OPTIONS
- High drivers, low restrainers: Proceed confidently
- Balanced forces: Address restrainers before proceeding
- Low drivers, high restrainers: Reconsider or build case
- Very high restrainers: May need different approach
