Document Code CST-KB-PS-001

This document provides comprehensive guidance on structured problem solving frameworks used in management consulting and strategic analysis. These frameworks enable systematic decomposition of complex problems into manageable components.

========================================

MECE PRINCIPLE

Purpose
Ensure problem decomposition is Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive, meaning categories do not overlap and together they cover the entire problem space.

MECE Defined

MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE
No overlap between categories. Each element belongs to exactly one category. Prevents double-counting or confusion.

COLLECTIVELY EXHAUSTIVE
Categories cover all possibilities. Nothing relevant is left out. Complete coverage of the problem space.

Why MECE Matters

- Ensures complete analysis without redundancy
- Enables clear communication and delegation
- Supports structured problem solving
- Creates foundation for issue trees and hypotheses

MECE Application Methods

USING STRUCTURES
Apply established frameworks like Porter Five Forces or McKinsey 7S that are inherently MECE. These provide proven structures for common problem types.

USING PROCESSES
Break down by sequential steps in a process. Each step is distinct and together they form the complete process. Example includes customer journey stages.

USING COMPONENTS
Decompose by physical or organizational units. Divisions, regions, or product lines. Each unit is separate and all units together form the whole.

USING CATEGORIES
Create conceptual categories that partition the space. Internal versus external factors. Quantitative versus qualitative measures.

MECE Testing

Ask These Questions
- Does any item fit in multiple categories
- Is anything relevant missing from all categories
- Can I clearly assign any new item to exactly one category
- If I sum all categories do I get the whole

Common MECE Structures

PROFIT DECOMPOSITION
Revenue minus Costs. Revenue equals Price times Volume. Costs equal Fixed plus Variable.

MARKET SIZING
Total market equals Number of customers times Average purchase frequency times Average purchase value.

GROWTH SOURCES
Organic growth plus Inorganic growth. Organic equals Volume growth plus Price growth plus Mix improvement.

MECE Pitfalls to Avoid

- Categories that overlap conceptually
- Missing categories that exclude relevant factors
- Excessive decomposition that obscures insight
- Forcing data into ill-fitting categories

========================================

ISSUE TREES

Purpose
Visually map a problem into component issues using hierarchical tree structure. Issue trees operationalize MECE thinking and guide structured analysis.

Issue Tree Types

DIAGNOSTIC TREES
Start with a problem statement. Decompose into possible causes. Further break down each cause. Used when investigating why something happened.

SOLUTION TREES
Start with objective or question. Decompose into possible solutions. Evaluate alternatives systematically. Used when determining what to do.

Issue Tree Construction

Step 1 - Define the Root Question
Frame the central issue as a question. Make it specific and actionable. Example How can we increase profitability by 15 percent.

Step 2 - Identify First-Level Branches
Determine major categories of the answer. Ensure branches are MECE. Typically 3-5 branches at first level.

Step 3 - Decompose Each Branch
Break each branch into sub-issues. Continue until issues are specific and testable. Stop when further decomposition adds no value.

Step 4 - Prioritize Branches
Assess which branches are most promising. Consider impact and feasibility. Focus analysis on priority areas.

Issue Tree Example - Profitability

Root - How can we improve profitability

First Level
- Increase revenue
- Reduce costs
- Improve asset utilization

Second Level under Increase Revenue
- Increase volume with existing customers
- Acquire new customers
- Increase price
- Improve product mix

Third Level under Increase Volume
- Increase purchase frequency
- Increase average transaction size
- Reduce customer churn

Issue Tree Best Practices

CLARITY
Each node should have clear meaning. Avoid vague or overlapping categories. Use specific language.

DEPTH
Go deep enough to reach testable hypotheses. Typically 3-4 levels for complex problems. Stop when issues become actionable.

BREADTH
Capture all relevant dimensions at each level. Avoid missing obvious categories. Check completeness before going deeper.

BALANCE
Avoid lopsided trees with all depth in one branch. Decompose evenly to maintain perspective. Note where branches are intentionally shallow.

========================================

HYPOTHESIS-DRIVEN APPROACH

Purpose
Accelerate problem solving by forming hypotheses early and testing them systematically, rather than conducting open-ended analysis that may not converge.

Hypothesis-Driven Principles

START WITH AN ANSWER
Form initial hypothesis based on available information. Structure work around proving or disproving it. Iterate as evidence accumulates.

TEST EFFICIENTLY
Design analyses to discriminate between hypotheses. Prioritize killer tests that definitively resolve questions. Avoid boiling the ocean.

ADAPT QUICKLY
Update hypotheses based on findings. Abandon hypotheses that fail tests. Generate new hypotheses as understanding grows.

Hypothesis Development

INITIAL HYPOTHESIS
Based on pattern recognition and experience. Informed by analogies and benchmarks. May be rough but should be specific.

HYPOTHESIS CRITERIA
Must be testable with available data and time. Should be mutually exclusive from alternatives. Must lead to actionable conclusions.

HYPOTHESIS STRUCTURE
If hypothesis then expected evidence. Specify what you would observe if true. Also specify what you would observe if false.

Hypothesis Testing Process

Step 1 - State the Hypothesis
Write clear testable statement. Define criteria for accepting or rejecting. Identify key assumptions.

Step 2 - Design Tests
Identify what data would prove or disprove. Prioritize tests by diagnostic power. Minimize effort to reach conclusion.

Step 3 - Gather Evidence
Collect data efficiently. Focus on discriminating information. Avoid confirming bias.

Step 4 - Evaluate Results
Compare evidence to acceptance criteria. Determine if hypothesis is supported. Document confidence level.

Step 5 - Iterate
If confirmed, proceed with confidence. If refuted, generate new hypotheses. If inconclusive, design better tests.

Hypothesis-Driven Benefits

- Accelerates time to insight
- Focuses effort on high-value work
- Creates testable interim conclusions
- Enables parallel workstreams

========================================

FIVE WHYS TECHNIQUE

Purpose
Reach root cause of problems by asking why repeatedly until fundamental cause is identified. Simple technique prevents superficial problem solving that addresses symptoms rather than causes.

Five Whys Process

Step 1 - State the Problem
Define the problem clearly and specifically. Focus on observable symptoms. Avoid embedding solutions in problem statement.

Step 2 - Ask Why
Why is this problem occurring. Get specific answer based on evidence. Avoid speculation without support.

Step 3 - Repeat
Take the answer and ask why again. Continue until root cause is reached. Usually takes about five iterations.

Step 4 - Identify Root Cause
Root cause is reached when further why would be speculative. Root cause should be actionable. Multiple root causes may emerge.

Step 5 - Verify
Test that addressing root cause would prevent problem. Ensure root cause is not a symptom of deeper issue. Validate with stakeholders.

Five Whys Example

Problem - Customer complaints have increased 40 percent

Why 1 - Why have complaints increased
Because product defects have increased

Why 2 - Why have product defects increased
Because quality inspections are missing defects

Why 3 - Why are inspections missing defects
Because inspectors are rushed and skipping steps

Why 4 - Why are inspectors rushed
Because inspection staffing was reduced 30 percent

Why 5 - Why was staffing reduced
Because cost reduction targets prioritized short-term savings

Root Cause - Cost reduction decisions did not account for quality impact

Five Whys Best Practices

- Stay focused on facts not opinions
- Avoid jumping to conclusions
- Follow multiple branches if answers diverge
- Include people with direct knowledge
- Document the chain of reasoning
- Validate each link in the chain

Five Whys Limitations

- May oversimplify complex problems
- Can lead to single root cause when multiple exist
- Depends on quality of initial problem statement
- Requires knowledge of the system being analyzed

========================================

PARETO PRINCIPLE 80-20 RULE

Purpose
Focus effort on the vital few factors that drive the majority of results. Named after Vilfredo Pareto who observed that 80 percent of effects come from 20 percent of causes.

Pareto Applications

BUSINESS APPLICATIONS
- 80 percent of revenue from 20 percent of customers
- 80 percent of complaints from 20 percent of issues
- 80 percent of results from 20 percent of activities
- 80 percent of costs from 20 percent of suppliers

ANALYSIS APPLICATIONS
- Focus on the factors that matter most
- Prioritize issues by impact
- Allocate resources to high-return areas
- Identify quick wins

Pareto Analysis Process

Step 1 - Define the Question
What outcome are you trying to improve. What factors might influence that outcome. What data do you have available.

Step 2 - Gather Data
Collect data on each factor and its contribution. Ensure data is comparable across factors. Include enough factors to be comprehensive.

Step 3 - Sort and Rank
Order factors by contribution descending. Calculate cumulative percentage. Identify the cutoff point.

Step 4 - Visualize
Create Pareto chart with bars for individual contribution. Add line for cumulative percentage. Mark the 80 percent threshold.

Step 5 - Prioritize Actions
Focus improvement efforts on the vital few. Address highest-impact factors first. Monitor whether distribution changes.

Pareto Chart Components

BARS
Show individual contribution of each factor. Ordered from highest to lowest. Use primary y-axis for scale.

CUMULATIVE LINE
Shows running total percentage. Rises steeply then flattens. Use secondary y-axis with 0-100 percent scale.

80 PERCENT LINE
Horizontal reference at 80 percent cumulative. Factors to left are the vital few. Factors to right are the trivial many.

Pareto Limitations

- Distribution may not be exactly 80-20
- May miss important qualitative factors
- Historical data may not predict future
- Can discourage attention to emerging issues

ISHIKAWA FISHBONE DIAGRAM

Purpose
Identify potential causes of a problem by organizing them into categories. Also called cause-and-effect diagram or Ishikawa diagram after its creator Kaoru Ishikawa.

Fishbone Structure

HEAD
The problem or effect being analyzed. Placed at the right side of the diagram. Should be specific and measurable.

SPINE
Horizontal line leading to the head. Represents the problem. Branches connect to the spine.

MAJOR BONES
Primary categories of causes. Typically 4-6 categories. Branch diagonally from spine.

MINOR BONES
Specific causes within each category. Branch from major bones. Can have sub-branches for detailed causes.

Standard Cause Categories

MANUFACTURING - 6 Ms
- Machines - Equipment and technology
- Methods - Processes and procedures
- Materials - Inputs and components
- Measurement - Data and metrics
- Mother Nature - Environment
- Manpower - People and skills

SERVICES - 4 Ps
- Policies - Rules and guidelines
- Procedures - Work processes
- People - Staff and skills
- Plant - Physical environment

Fishbone Construction Process

Step 1 - Define the Problem
Write clear problem statement. Place at head of fish. Ensure team agrees on definition.

Step 2 - Determine Major Categories
Select appropriate category framework. Customize categories for your context. Draw major bones from spine.

Step 3 - Brainstorm Causes
Generate potential causes for each category. Use why questions to go deeper. Add causes as minor bones.

Step 4 - Analyze the Diagram
Look for causes that appear in multiple categories. Identify most likely root causes. Prioritize causes for investigation.

Step 5 - Validate and Act
Test hypothesized causes with data. Confirm root causes before acting. Develop solutions for validated causes.

Fishbone Best Practices

- Include diverse perspectives in brainstorming
- Go deep enough to find actionable causes
- Avoid stopping at symptoms
- Use data to validate brainstormed causes
- Focus solutions on root causes

========================================

FORCE FIELD ANALYSIS

Purpose
Analyze the forces for and against a change to understand what must be addressed to achieve desired outcome. Developed by Kurt Lewin as part of his change management theory.

Force Field Concept

CURRENT STATE
Equilibrium between driving and restraining forces. Forces are balanced which maintains status quo. Change requires disrupting this balance.

DRIVING FORCES
Push toward the desired change. Include benefits, pressures, and motivations. Strengthening these helps achieve change.

RESTRAINING FORCES
Push against the change. Include obstacles, risks, and resistance. Reducing these enables change.

DESIRED STATE
New equilibrium after change is achieved. Requires either strengthening drivers or weakening restrainers. Ideally both.

Force Field Analysis Process

Step 1 - Define Current and Desired States
Describe where you are now. Describe where you want to be. Clarify the gap between them.

Step 2 - Identify Driving Forces
Brainstorm all forces favoring change. Consider internal and external factors. Rate each force by strength 1-5.

Step 3 - Identify Restraining Forces
Brainstorm all forces opposing change. Include rational and emotional factors. Rate each force by strength 1-5.

Step 4 - Analyze the Balance
Sum driving and restraining force scores. Identify the strongest forces on each side. Look for forces that could shift.

Step 5 - Develop Strategy
Determine which forces to address. Strengthen key drivers and weaken key restrainers. Prioritize actions by impact and feasibility.

Force Field Diagram

LAYOUT
Vertical line represents current state. Arrows from left are driving forces. Arrows from right are restraining forces. Arrow size indicates force strength.

SCORING
Rate each force 1-5 for strength. Longer arrows for stronger forces. Compare totals to assess balance.

Force Field Strategies

STRENGTHEN DRIVERS
Increase intensity of positive forces. Add new driving forces. Remove constraints on existing drivers.

WEAKEN RESTRAINERS
Address root causes of resistance. Remove obstacles to change. Provide resources to overcome barriers.

CONVERT FORCES
Turn restrainers into drivers. Find benefits for those who resist. Reframe the change narrative.

Force Field in Change Management

- Use in planning phase to understand dynamics
- Identify stakeholders behind each force
- Design interventions for key forces
- Monitor force balance during implementation
- Adjust strategy as forces shift
