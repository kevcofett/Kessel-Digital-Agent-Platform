CONFIDENCE LEVEL FRAMEWORK

KESSEL DIGITAL AGENT PLATFORM - SHARED KNOWLEDGE BASE
Version 1.0
Document Code EAP-KB-CL-001

This document establishes platform-wide standards for expressing confidence in findings, recommendations, and analysis. All agents must indicate confidence levels for significant outputs to help users understand reliability and make informed decisions.

========================================

CONFIDENCE BAND DEFINITIONS

HIGH CONFIDENCE - 85 TO 100 PERCENT CERTAINTY

Criteria for High Confidence

- Multiple authoritative sources agree on finding
- Data is recent, within twelve months of analysis date
- Direct evidence from verified primary sources
- Established industry benchmarks support conclusion
- Methodology is well-documented and replicable
- Sample sizes are statistically significant where applicable
- No significant conflicting evidence exists

Language Patterns for High Confidence

- Evidence strongly indicates...
- Data confirms...
- Analysis demonstrates...
- Research verifies...
- Multiple sources establish...
- The evidence clearly shows...
- We can state with confidence that...

Example Applications

- Market size is USD 4.2B (HIGH CONFIDENCE - three analyst reports from Q3 2024 align within 5 percent variance)
- Customer acquisition cost reduction of 20 percent is achievable (HIGH CONFIDENCE - five comparable implementations documented with similar results)
- Channel mix recommendation is optimal (HIGH CONFIDENCE - validated against industry benchmarks and client historical performance)

MEDIUM CONFIDENCE - 60 TO 84 PERCENT CERTAINTY

Criteria for Medium Confidence

- Limited but credible sources support finding
- Data is somewhat dated, twelve to twenty-four months old
- Indirect evidence or proxy metrics used
- Emerging patterns not yet fully established
- Some assumptions required but well-reasoned
- Single authoritative source without corroboration
- Minor conflicting evidence exists but is explained

Language Patterns for Medium Confidence

- Evidence suggests...
- Analysis indicates...
- Available data implies...
- Patterns point to...
- Preliminary findings show...
- Based on current information...
- The balance of evidence suggests...

Example Applications

- Competitor likely to enter market segment within twelve months (MEDIUM CONFIDENCE - industry signals and hiring patterns suggest expansion but no official announcement)
- Technology migration will improve efficiency by 15 to 20 percent (MEDIUM CONFIDENCE - two case studies from similar industries show this range)
- Budget allocation should shift toward digital channels (MEDIUM CONFIDENCE - emerging benchmark data supports this but sample sizes remain limited)

LOW CONFIDENCE - 40 TO 59 PERCENT CERTAINTY

Criteria for Low Confidence

- Single source or conflicting sources without resolution
- Data is old, more than twenty-four months
- Significant assumptions required
- Limited sample size or anecdotal evidence
- Novel situation with limited precedent
- Methodology limitations acknowledged
- Expert judgment without supporting data

Language Patterns for Low Confidence

- Preliminary analysis suggests...
- Based on limited available data...
- Assuming stated conditions hold, this indicates...
- Initial assessment points to...
- With noted caveats, evidence suggests...
- Early indicators show...
- Directional findings suggest...

Example Applications

- Pricing strategy could increase margins by 15 to 20 percent (LOW CONFIDENCE - limited comparable cases and significant market differences)
- New market entry would require USD 2M to 5M investment (LOW CONFIDENCE - wide range reflects uncertainty in competitive response)
- Implementation timeline of eighteen months is feasible (LOW CONFIDENCE - novel technology stack with single vendor estimate)

SPECULATIVE - BELOW 40 PERCENT CERTAINTY

Criteria for Speculative Assessment

- Insufficient data to form evidence-based view
- Purely directional guidance based on general principles
- No relevant benchmarks or precedent available
- Significant unknowns remain unresolved
- Analysis would require primary research to validate

Language Patterns for Speculative Assessment

- Without additional data, we hypothesize...
- Directionally, this might indicate...
- For planning purposes only, consider...
- Subject to validation through research...
- As a working hypothesis...

Example Applications

- Market timing appears favorable but requires validation (SPECULATIVE - insufficient data on competitive dynamics)
- Customer response may be positive based on general trends (SPECULATIVE - no direct research on target segment)

Note - Speculative assessments should prompt recommendations for additional research before major decisions.

========================================

CONFIDENCE CALCULATION FACTORS

When determining confidence level, agents should consider four primary factors and weight them according to situation.

FACTOR 1 - DATA RECENCY

- Within six months - Full confidence weight, no degradation
- Six to twelve months - Minor degradation, still current for most purposes
- Twelve to twenty-four months - Moderate degradation, verify major trends have not shifted
- Over twenty-four months - Significant degradation, use with explicit caveat
- Over thirty-six months - Generally not suitable as primary evidence

FACTOR 2 - SOURCE QUALITY

Refer to EAP_KB_Data_Provenance for complete tier definitions

- Tier 1 sources - Full confidence weight
- Tier 2 sources - Slight reduction in confidence weight
- Tier 3 sources - Significant reduction, require corroboration
- Tier 3 alone - Cannot support HIGH confidence findings

FACTOR 3 - SAMPLE SIZE AND REPRESENTATIVENESS

- Large representative sample - Full confidence weight
- Moderate sample with some representation gaps - Minor degradation
- Small sample or convenience sample - Moderate degradation
- Single case or anecdotal - Significant degradation, treat as directional only

FACTOR 4 - METHODOLOGY RIGOR

- Documented methodology, peer-reviewed or validated - Full confidence weight
- Documented methodology, industry-standard approach - Minor degradation
- Methodology described but not validated - Moderate degradation
- Methodology unclear or absent - Significant degradation

COMBINED FACTOR ASSESSMENT

Overall confidence is limited by weakest factor. Strong performance on three factors cannot overcome critical weakness on fourth factor.

Example - Tier 1 source with rigorous methodology but thirty-six-month-old data and small sample cannot achieve HIGH confidence regardless of source authority.

========================================

UNCERTAINTY COMMUNICATION STANDARDS

WHEN TO USE RANGES VERSUS POINT ESTIMATES

Use Point Estimates When

- HIGH confidence findings with narrow variance
- Industry standard metrics with established precision
- Client-provided data accepted as accurate
- Simple calculations from verified inputs

Use Ranges When

- MEDIUM or LOW confidence findings
- Significant assumptions could swing results
- Multiple scenarios are plausible
- Methodology produces confidence intervals naturally

Range Presentation Standards

- Narrow range for MEDIUM confidence - Plus or minus 10 to 20 percent
- Wide range for LOW confidence - Plus or minus 20 to 40 percent or explicit min-max bounds
- Scenario ranges for strategic options - Best case, base case, worst case with probability weights

MANDATORY CAVEATS BY CONFIDENCE LEVEL

HIGH Confidence Outputs

- No mandatory caveat required
- Optional - Note source and date for transparency

MEDIUM Confidence Outputs

- Required caveat format - This finding assumes [key assumption]. Confidence would increase with [specific additional data or validation].
- Must note primary limitation or assumption

LOW Confidence Outputs

- Required caveat format - This preliminary finding is based on [limited evidence type]. Before major decisions, recommend [specific validation step].
- Must identify path to higher confidence

SPECULATIVE Outputs

- Required caveat format - This directional view requires validation through [specific research or data gathering] before use in decision-making.
- Must explicitly label as hypothesis or working assumption

========================================

PRESENTATION STANDARDS

INLINE CONFIDENCE INDICATORS

For conversational outputs and analysis narrative

Format - [Finding statement] ([CONFIDENCE LEVEL] - [brief rationale])

Examples

- Market growth will exceed fifteen percent annually (HIGH CONFIDENCE - three analyst forecasts from 2024 align within two points)
- Customer segment shows high potential (MEDIUM CONFIDENCE - two case studies, limited direct segment research)
- Implementation risk is manageable (LOW CONFIDENCE - novel approach with single comparable project)

TABLE AND CHART INDICATORS

For tabular data and visualizations

- Include Confidence column in data tables
- Use consistent indicators - H for High, M for Medium, L for Low, S for Speculative
- Add footnote explaining confidence methodology if table shared externally

DELIVERABLE DOCUMENT STANDARDS

For formal documents and presentations

- Executive Summary should note overall confidence profile
- Findings section should include inline confidence for each major finding
- Recommendations should explicitly note confidence level supporting each recommendation
- Appendix should include complete Research Quality Summary per EAP_KB_Data_Provenance

========================================

ESCALATION AND DECISION THRESHOLDS

WHEN TO ESCALATE CONFIDENCE CONCERNS

If analysis relies primarily on LOW confidence data

- Explicitly state limitations to stakeholders before presenting recommendations
- Recommend additional research before major capital or strategic decisions
- Offer to refine analysis with additional client data or commissioned research
- Identify specific data that would increase confidence

If confidence levels conflict across related findings

- Present range of potential outcomes reflecting uncertainty
- Weight recommendations by confidence of supporting evidence
- Identify which findings drive key decision points
- Note where single finding weakness undermines broader conclusion

DECISION THRESHOLD GUIDANCE

HIGH CONFIDENCE required for

- Large capital allocation decisions over USD 1M
- Strategic pivots affecting core business
- Public commitments or announcements
- Regulatory compliance determinations

MEDIUM CONFIDENCE acceptable for

- Tactical budget allocation within established strategy
- Pilot program design and scope
- Internal planning and scenario development
- Preliminary project scoping

LOW CONFIDENCE acceptable only for

- Early-stage exploration and ideation
- Directional guidance pending further research
- Risk identification for further investigation
- Hypothesis development for validation

========================================

CONFIDENCE OVER TIME

CONFIDENCE DECAY

Static findings degrade over time as market conditions evolve

- HIGH confidence findings remain HIGH for six months, then degrade to MEDIUM
- MEDIUM confidence findings degrade to LOW after twelve months without refresh
- LOW confidence findings should not be cited after eighteen months without validation

CONFIDENCE IMPROVEMENT

Confidence can be improved through

- Additional corroborating sources at same or higher tier
- More recent data replacing dated sources
- Primary research validating secondary sources
- Client data confirming external benchmarks
- Successful pilot or implementation validating projections

========================================
