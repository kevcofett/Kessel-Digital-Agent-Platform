FORMATTING STANDARDS AND DOCUMENT COMPLIANCE

KESSEL DIGITAL AGENT PLATFORM - SHARED KNOWLEDGE BASE
Version 1.0
Document Code EAP-KB-FS-001

This document establishes platform-wide formatting standards for all content created within the platform. These standards ensure consistency, accessibility, and compatibility across all agents and deployment environments.

========================================

THE 6-RULE COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK

All Knowledge Base files and Copilot Instruction files must comply with the 6-Rule Framework. This ensures compatibility with Microsoft Copilot Studio and consistent rendering across all environments.

RULE 1 - ALL-CAPS HEADERS

Section titles and major headings must use ALL CAPITAL LETTERS.

Correct Examples
- MARKET ANALYSIS
- RECOMMENDATIONS
- AUDIENCE SEGMENTATION

Incorrect Examples
- Market Analysis (mixed case)
- Recommendations (sentence case)
- audience segmentation (lowercase)

Rationale - All-caps headers create visual hierarchy without relying on formatting features like bold or heading styles that may not render in all environments.

RULE 2 - HYPHENS-ONLY LISTS

All list items must use hyphens as the only list marker. Bullets, numbers, and other markers are prohibited.

Correct Format
- First item
- Second item
- Third item

Incorrect Formats
- Bullet points
- Numbered lists (1. 2. 3.)
- Lettered lists (a. b. c.)
- Asterisks
- Plus signs

Rationale - Hyphens render consistently across all text environments. Other list markers may render inconsistently or not at all in Copilot Studio.

RULE 3 - ASCII CHARACTERS ONLY

All content must use standard ASCII characters. Extended Unicode, special characters, and formatting characters are prohibited.

Prohibited Characters
- Em-dash (long dash)
- En-dash (medium dash)
- Smart quotes (curly quotes)
- Bullet characters
- Copyright and trademark symbols (use text: copyright, trademark)
- Mathematical symbols beyond basic operators
- Currency symbols other than USD (use text: EUR, GBP, JPY)
- Arrows and other decorative characters

Allowed Characters
- Standard hyphen-minus
- Straight quotes (apostrophe and quotation mark)
- Basic punctuation (period, comma, colon, semicolon, parentheses)
- Standard letters and numbers
- Basic mathematical operators (plus, minus, asterisk, forward slash, equals)
- Percent sign, at sign, ampersand, number sign
- Dollar sign for USD amounts

Rationale - Non-ASCII characters may not render correctly in all environments and can cause parsing errors in Copilot Studio.

RULE 4 - ZERO VISUAL DEPENDENCIES

Content must be fully comprehensible without any visual formatting. The meaning must be clear from text alone.

This Means
- No reliance on bold or italic for meaning
- No reliance on color coding
- No reliance on font size variation
- No reliance on tables for structure (use text alternatives)
- No images or diagrams without text description

Testing Method - If content were rendered as plain monospace text, would all meaning be preserved? If yes, it complies. If no, restructure.

Rationale - Copilot Studio strips visual formatting. Content must work as plain text.

RULE 5 - MANDATORY LANGUAGE

Use clear, unambiguous directive language for requirements and prohibitions.

Required Terms for Obligations
- Must - Required action, no exceptions
- Shall - Formal requirement, equivalent to must
- Always - Required in every case
- Required - Explicit statement of obligation

Required Terms for Prohibitions
- Never - Prohibited in every case
- Must not - Prohibited action
- Shall not - Formal prohibition
- Prohibited - Explicit statement of prohibition

Avoid Ambiguous Terms
- Should (use must for requirements, consider for suggestions)
- Could (use may for permissions, can for capability)
- Might (use will for predictions, may for uncertainty)
- Try to (use must, or state best effort explicitly)

Rationale - Clear directive language eliminates ambiguity in agent behavior.

RULE 6 - PROFESSIONAL TONE

Content must maintain professional, authoritative tone throughout.

Tone Requirements
- Clear and direct statements
- Active voice preferred over passive
- Consistent terminology throughout document
- No casual or colloquial language
- No humor or entertainment content in KB files
- Technical precision in terminology

Tone Examples

Professional - The agent must validate input before processing.
Unprofessional - Basically the agent should try to check the input first.

Professional - Analysis indicates market opportunity exists.
Unprofessional - Looks like there might be a good opportunity here.

Rationale - Professional tone ensures clarity and builds user confidence.

OUTPUT FORMATTING STANDARDS

RESPONSE STRUCTURE PATTERNS

Analysis Response Pattern

ANALYSIS: [Topic]

[Opening statement of key finding]

FINDINGS

[Finding 1 with evidence and confidence]
[Finding 2 with evidence and confidence]

IMPLICATIONS

[What findings mean for user situation]

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

[Specific actionable recommendations]

Recommendation Response Pattern

RECOMMENDATION: [Topic]

[Opening recommendation statement]

RATIONALE

[Why this recommendation]
[Evidence supporting recommendation]

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

[How to implement]
[Key steps or considerations]

ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED

[Other options and why not recommended]

Error Response Pattern

I was not able to [specific action] because [reason].

What you can do: [User action option]
What I will try instead: [Alternative approach if applicable]

WHEN TO USE STRUCTURED SECTIONS VERSUS PROSE

Use Structured Sections When
- Response contains multiple distinct components
- User needs to scan for specific information
- Content naturally breaks into categories
- Length exceeds three paragraphs

Use Prose When
- Response is conversational clarification
- Content is single coherent thought
- Length is short, under three paragraphs
- Structured format would feel mechanical

NUMBER FORMATTING STANDARDS

Currency
- Use USD prefix for dollar amounts: USD 4.2M, USD 500K
- Use three-letter code for other currencies: EUR 1.5M, GBP 800K
- Use K for thousands, M for millions, B for billions
- Include decimal for partial millions: USD 1.5M not USD 1,500,000

Percentages
- Use word percent or percent symbol consistently within document
- Prefer word percent in prose: growth rate of 15 percent
- Percent symbol acceptable in tables and lists: 15%
- Always include leading zero for decimals: 0.5% not .5%

Large Numbers
- Use comma separators for thousands: 1,000 not 1000
- Use K, M, B abbreviations for readability in context
- Spell out numbers one through nine in prose
- Use numerals for 10 and above in prose

DATE AND TIME FORMATTING

Dates
- Use format: Month Day, Year (January 15, 2025)
- Or use ISO format for data: 2025-01-15
- Abbreviate months in tables: Jan, Feb, Mar
- Fiscal year notation: FY25 or FY2025

Time References
- Use relative terms when precision not needed: recently, last quarter
- Use specific dates when precision matters: Q3 2024, November 2024
- Note timezone if relevant to analysis

Ranges
- Date ranges: January 2024 to March 2024 or Q1 2024
- Value ranges: USD 1.5M to USD 2.0M or 15 to 20 percent
- Use to rather than hyphen for ranges in prose

========================================

CHARACTER LIMIT ENFORCEMENT

KB FILE LIMITS

- Maximum - 36,000 characters
- Target range - 8,000 to 30,000 characters for most files
- Warning threshold - Files over 32,000 characters should be reviewed for splitting

INSTRUCTION FILE LIMITS

- Maximum - 8,000 characters (hard limit imposed by Copilot Studio)
- Target range - 7,500 to 7,999 characters
- Below 7,500 may indicate missing required content
- At or above 8,000 will fail deployment

CHUNKING STRATEGY FOR LARGE CONTENT

When content exceeds KB limits

- Identify natural topic boundaries
- Create separate files for each major topic
- Use consistent naming: AGENT_KB_Topic_Part1_v1.txt, AGENT_KB_Topic_Part2_v1.txt
- Or split by subtopic: AGENT_KB_Topic_Core_v1.txt, AGENT_KB_Topic_Advanced_v1.txt
- Include cross-references between related files

CHARACTER COUNT VERIFICATION

Before finalizing any Copilot document

- Count total characters including whitespace
- Verify against applicable limit
- Document character count in commit message
- Re-verify after any edit, no matter how small

========================================

COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before committing any KB or Instruction file, verify

RULE 1 CHECK
- All section headers are ALL CAPS
- No mixed case or sentence case headers

RULE 2 CHECK
- All lists use hyphens only
- No bullets, numbers, or other markers

RULE 3 CHECK
- No em-dashes or en-dashes (use regular hyphen)
- No smart quotes (use straight quotes)
- No special characters or symbols
- Verify by searching for common violations

RULE 4 CHECK
- Remove any formatting like bold markers
- Ensure meaning clear without visual styling
- Tables converted to text descriptions

RULE 5 CHECK
- Requirements use must, shall, always
- Prohibitions use never, must not, prohibited
- No ambiguous should, could, might without context
