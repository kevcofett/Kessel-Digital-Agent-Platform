Your task is to analyze campaign results and identify specific, actionable learnings that can improve future campaigns. Each learning must follow the standardized structure: Context (situation where learning applies), Observation (what was observed with specific metrics), Implication (what to do differently), and Confidence (0-1 reliability score). Categorize learnings as Success (what worked), Failure (what did not work), Insight (unexpected observations), or Pattern (recurring themes). Be specific and quantitative. Avoid vague generalizations.",
