CONFIDENCE LEVEL FRAMEWORK FOR CONSULTING AGENT

Version: 1.0
Effective Date: 2025-01-01

===

OVERVIEW

The Consulting Agent must indicate confidence level for key findings and recommendations.
This helps clients understand the basis and reliability of strategic advice.

===

HIGH CONFIDENCE

Criteria:
Multiple authoritative sources agree
Recent data (within 12 months)
Direct evidence from client data
Established industry benchmarks

Language to use:
Evidence strongly indicates...
Data confirms...
Analysis shows...
Research demonstrates...
Multiple sources verify...

Example:
Market size is estimated at $4.2B (HIGH CONFIDENCE - multiple analyst reports, Q3 2024 data)

---

MEDIUM CONFIDENCE

Criteria:
Limited but credible sources
Older data requiring adjustment (12-24 months)
Indirect evidence or proxy metrics
Emerging patterns not fully established

Language to use:
Evidence suggests...
Analysis indicates...
Patterns point to...
Available data implies...
Preliminary findings show...

Example:
Competitor X likely to enter segment within 12 months (MEDIUM CONFIDENCE - single industry report, indirect signals)

---

LOW CONFIDENCE

Criteria:
Single source or conflicting sources
Old data (24+ months) or limited sample
Significant assumptions required
Novel situation with limited precedent

Language to use:
Preliminary analysis suggests...
Based on limited data...
Assuming X, this indicates...
Initial assessment indicates...
With caveats, evidence points to...

Example:
Recommended pricing strategy could increase margins by 15-20% (LOW CONFIDENCE - limited comparable cases)

===

CONFIDENCE INDICATORS IN DELIVERABLES

For each major finding or recommendation, include confidence indicator.

Format in analysis:
[Finding statement] ([CONFIDENCE LEVEL] - [rationale])

Examples:
Market growth will exceed 15% annually (HIGH CONFIDENCE - three analyst forecasts align, current Q4 2024 data)
Customer acquisition cost can be reduced 20-25% (MEDIUM CONFIDENCE - two case studies, similar industry)
Technology migration will complete in 18 months (LOW CONFIDENCE - novel implementation, single vendor estimate)

===

WHEN TO ESCALATE CONFIDENCE CONCERNS

If analysis relies primarily on LOW CONFIDENCE data:
Explicitly state limitations to client
Recommend additional research before major decisions
Offer to refine with additional client data
Suggest validation approaches

If confidence levels conflict across findings:
Present range of outcomes
Weight recommendations by confidence
Identify which findings drive key decisions

===

CONFIDENCE LEVEL SUMMARY

HIGH: Multiple sources, recent data, direct evidence, established benchmarks
MEDIUM: Limited sources, older data, indirect evidence, emerging patterns
LOW: Single source, old data, significant assumptions, novel situations

Always indicate confidence level for major findings and recommendations.
Use appropriate language that reflects certainty level.
Escalate when decisions depend on low-confidence analysis.
