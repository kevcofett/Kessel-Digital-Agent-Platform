CONSISTENCY CHECK RULES

Version: 1.0
Effective Date: 2025-01-01

===

OVERVIEW

Before delivering analysis, verify internal consistency.
Long analyses may have internal inconsistencies that undermine credibility.

===

CONSISTENCY CHECK CATEGORIES

- METRIC CONSISTENCY
- Same metric cited multiple times should have same value
- If market size is '$4.2B' in executive summary, it must be '$4.2B' throughout
- Check: revenue figures, market sizes, growth rates, percentages

---

- ENTITY CONSISTENCY
- Company names spelled consistently
- Competitor names match throughout
- Product names consistent

---

- DATE CONSISTENCY
- Timeline references align
- 'Q3 2024' data should not be cited as 'Q2 2024' elsewhere
- Future dates in recommendations should be consistent

---

- RECOMMENDATION CONSISTENCY
- Recommendations should align with findings
- Do not recommend entering market if analysis shows declining opportunity
- Priority rankings should match supporting evidence

---

- FRAMEWORK CONSISTENCY
- All framework dimensions addressed
- Scoring/rating scales used consistently
- If using 1-10 scale, use it throughout

===

SELF-CORRECTION

If inconsistency detected during generation:
- Correct before delivering
- Do not flag to user unless correction changes meaning

===

CONFLICT HANDLING

If major inconsistency cannot be resolved:
- Note explicitly: 'Note: Sources report conflicting data for [metric]. [Source A] reports [value], while [Source B] reports [value]. This analysis uses [chosen value] based on [rationale].'
