CUSTOM FRAMEWORK GUIDE

Version: 1.0
Effective Date: 2025-01-01

===

OVERVIEW

Clients can define custom frameworks that extend the standard 32-framework library.
Custom frameworks are stored as KB files following a standard structure.
Agent will recognize and apply custom frameworks like standard frameworks.

===

CUSTOM FRAMEWORK STRUCTURE

Required Sections:

FRAMEWORK NAME
[Unique name for the framework]

CATEGORY
[Strategic, Competitive, Customer, Operations, Innovation, or Custom]

DESCRIPTION
[2-3 sentence description of what the framework analyzes]

BEST FOR
[Bullet list of use cases where this framework excels]

DIMENSIONS
[List of dimensions/components to analyze, with descriptions]

METHODOLOGY
[Step-by-step instructions for applying the framework]

OUTPUT FORMAT
[Expected deliverable structure: sections, tables, visualizations]

EXAMPLE APPLICATION
[Brief example showing framework applied to a sample case]

---

Optional Sections:

TYPICAL DEPTH
[Recommended word counts for Quick/Standard/Comprehensive]

RELATED FRAMEWORKS
[Standard frameworks that complement this one]

DATA REQUIREMENTS
[What data/inputs are needed to apply this framework]

===

FILE NAMING CONVENTION

Custom_Framework_[Name]_v[Version].txt

Examples:
- Custom_Framework_BrandEquityScorecard_v1.txt
- Custom_Framework_ChannelProfitability_v1.txt
- Custom_Framework_VendorRiskAssessment_v1.txt

===

ADDING CUSTOM FRAMEWORKS

Option 1: SharePoint Upload
- Create framework file following structure above
- Save as Custom_Framework_[Name]_v1.txt
- Upload to Consulting_Agent KB folder in SharePoint
- Wait for KB re-index (daily)
- Test by asking agent to use the framework

Option 2: Request via Agent
- Tell agent: 'I want to create a custom framework for [purpose]'
- Agent will guide through required sections
- Agent will format and request admin upload

===

USING CUSTOM FRAMEWORKS

Agent automatically checks for custom frameworks when:
- User mentions a framework name not in standard library
- User describes analysis that matches custom framework best-for
- User explicitly requests: 'Use our [Framework Name] framework'

Recognition patterns:
- 'Use our brand equity scorecard' = searches for Custom_Framework_BrandEquityScorecard
- 'Apply the channel profitability analysis' = searches for Custom_Framework_ChannelProfitability

If custom framework found:
- Agent applies using documented methodology
- Output follows framework's specified format
- Citations note 'Custom Framework: [Name]'

If custom framework not found:
- Agent asks: 'I do not see a custom framework called [Name]. Would you like me to:
  - Use a similar standard framework ([suggestions])
  - Help you create this as a new custom framework
  - Proceed with a general analysis approach'

===

VALIDATION RULES

Custom frameworks must have:
- Unique name (no duplicates with standard or other custom)
- All required sections completed
- At least 3 dimensions defined
- Clear methodology steps

Custom frameworks cannot:
- Override standard framework definitions
- Use reserved framework names (SWOT, Porter's, etc.)
- Exceed 10,000 characters (for KB indexing)
