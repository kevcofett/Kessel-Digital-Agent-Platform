Version: 1.0
Effective Date: 2025-01-01

===

OVERVIEW

When user is uncertain between frameworks, present side-by-side comparison.
Use this logic to determine which frameworks to compare and recommend.

COMPARISON TRIGGER PHRASES

Present comparison when user says:
- Which framework should I use?
- What is the difference between X and Y?
- I am not sure if I need X or Y
- Help me choose a framework
- Compare X and Y

===

AUTO-SELECTION RULES

Skip comparison and auto-select when:
- User explicitly names a framework
- Context clearly fits one framework (e.g., vendor comparison = Decision Matrix)
- User says comprehensive and mentions competitive = Porter's Five Forces
- User mentions customer needs or innovation = Jobs-to-be-Done

===

RECOMMENDATION RATIONALE FORMAT

Always explain why one framework is recommended:
I recommend [Framework] because your focus on [user's stated goal] aligns with [Framework]'s strength in [specific capability]. [Framework] will help you [specific outcome] in approximately [time estimate].
