MODULE OVERVIEW
----------------------------------------

The Consulting Tools Module provides additional methodologies, techniques, and tools that complement the 32 frameworks in the Framework Library System. These tools support specific analytical needs.

----------------------------------------
SIZING AND ESTIMATION TOOLS
----------------------------------------

Market Sizing Approaches

Top-Down Sizing: Start with total market and narrow to addressable segment. Use for quick estimates with available macro data. Formula: Total Market multiplied by Relevant Segment Percentage multiplied by Accessible Percentage.

Bottom-Up Sizing: Build from unit economics upward. Use when detailed data available. Formula: Number of Customers multiplied by Purchase Frequency multiplied by Average Transaction Value.

Value-Based Sizing: Size based on value created or problem cost. Use for innovative solutions. Formula: Number of Entities with Problem multiplied by Cost of Problem multiplied by Capture Rate.

Estimation Best Practices

State assumptions explicitly. Use ranges rather than point estimates. Triangulate with multiple approaches. Validate with available data points. Document sensitivity to key assumptions.

----------------------------------------
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS TOOLS
----------------------------------------

ROI Calculation

Simple ROI: (Gain from Investment minus Cost of Investment) divided by Cost of Investment.

Net Present Value: Sum of Cash Flows divided by (1 plus Discount Rate) raised to period power minus Initial Investment.

Internal Rate of Return: Discount rate where NPV equals zero.

Payback Period: Time to recover initial investment.

Business Case Structure

Executive Summary with recommendation and key numbers. Current State with baseline costs and performance. Proposed Solution with description and approach. Benefits Quantification with revenue and cost benefits. Costs with implementation, ongoing, and hidden costs. Risk Assessment with risks and mitigations. Timeline with implementation phases. Recommendation with go or no-go with conditions.

----------------------------------------
PRIORITIZATION TOOLS
----------------------------------------

Impact-Effort Matrix

High Impact High Effort: Strategic initiatives requiring significant investment. High Impact Low Effort: Quick wins to prioritize immediately. Low Impact Low Effort: Fill-ins if capacity available. Low Impact High Effort: Avoid or deprioritize.

MoSCoW Prioritization

Must Have: Critical requirements without alternatives. Should Have: Important but not critical. Could Have: Desirable if time and resources allow. Wont Have: Agreed exclusions for this phase.

Weighted Scoring

Define criteria and weights. Score each option against criteria. Calculate weighted scores. Rank by total weighted score. Validate with stakeholders.

----------------------------------------
STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS TOOLS
----------------------------------------

Stakeholder Mapping

Identify all stakeholders. Assess each stakeholder interest and influence. Map on Interest versus Influence grid. Develop engagement strategy by quadrant.

High Influence High Interest: Manage closely with regular engagement. High Influence Low Interest: Keep satisfied with periodic updates. Low Influence High Interest: Keep informed with regular communication. Low Influence Low Interest: Monitor with minimal effort.

RACI for Stakeholders

Extend RACI beyond tasks to stakeholder decisions. Map stakeholder roles for key decisions. Identify gaps and overlaps. Clarify accountabilities.

----------------------------------------
CHANGE MANAGEMENT TOOLS
----------------------------------------

Change Impact Assessment

Identify affected stakeholders. Assess impact by stakeholder group. Determine change magnitude. Identify resistance risks. Plan mitigation strategies.

ADKAR Model

Awareness: Understanding need for change. Desire: Motivation to support change. Knowledge: Understanding how to change. Ability: Capability to implement change. Reinforcement: Sustaining the change.

Communication Planning

Stakeholder identification. Message development by audience. Channel selection. Timing and frequency. Feedback mechanisms.

----------------------------------------
WORKSHOP FACILITATION TOOLS
----------------------------------------

Workshop Design

Define objectives and outcomes. Identify participants. Design agenda and activities. Prepare materials. Plan logistics. Document outputs.

Facilitation Techniques

Brainstorming: Generate ideas without judgment. Affinity Mapping: Group related ideas. Dot Voting: Prioritize democratically. World Cafe: Rotate discussions across topics. Six Thinking Hats: Explore perspectives systematically.

Output Documentation

Capture decisions made. Document action items with owners. Note open questions. Record parking lot items. Summarize key insights.

----------------------------------------
INTERVIEW AND RESEARCH TOOLS
----------------------------------------

Interview Guide Design

Define research objectives. Develop hypothesis to test. Create question flow. Include probing questions. Plan for documentation.

Interview Best Practices

Establish rapport early. Use open-ended questions. Listen actively with minimal interruption. Probe for specifics and examples. Summarize understanding. Thank and clarify next steps.

Synthesis Approaches

Thematic analysis to identify patterns. Quote extraction for evidence. Stakeholder view comparison. Insight prioritization. Implication development.

----------------------------------------
DATA ANALYSIS TOOLS
----------------------------------------

Descriptive Analytics

Central tendency using mean, median, mode. Dispersion using range, standard deviation, variance. Distribution shape and outliers. Trend identification.

Comparative Analysis

Benchmark comparison. Time period comparison. Segment comparison. Scenario comparison.

Visualization Selection

Trends over time: Line charts. Category comparison: Bar charts. Part of whole: Pie charts or treemaps. Relationships: Scatter plots. Distribution: Histograms. Geographic: Maps.
