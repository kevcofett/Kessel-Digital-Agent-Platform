Clean Room Reference Guide

Version 7.0

Last Updated: December 2024

Document Purpose

This reference document provides comprehensive information on data clean room platforms for privacy-preserving data collaboration. It covers technical requirements, use cases, partner ecosystems, and pricing models to support vendor evaluation and selection decisions.

Market Overview

Data clean rooms have emerged as critical infrastructure for marketing and advertising in a privacy-first world. These platforms enable brands, publishers, and partners to collaborate on data without exposing underlying customer information. The market has consolidated around two primary approaches: dedicated clean room platforms built specifically for data collaboration, and clean room features native to cloud data platforms.

Key market trends include integration with retail media networks, support for privacy-enhancing technologies like differential privacy and secure multi-party computation, and convergence with identity resolution capabilities. The total addressable market for clean rooms is estimated at 1.5 billion dollars in 2024, growing to 4 billion dollars by 2027.

Selection Criteria

When evaluating clean room platforms, consider the following factors.

Technical Fit: Does the platform support your existing cloud infrastructure and data formats? Consider deployment model, integration requirements, and technical team capabilities.

Use Case Alignment: Does the platform have pre-built templates and partner integrations for your primary use cases? Advertising, retail media, and financial services have different requirements.

Partner Ecosystem: Can your key collaboration partners access the platform? Consider whether partners are already on the platform or if onboarding is required.

Privacy Architecture: Does the technical approach meet your privacy and compliance requirements? Evaluate non-movement versus query-based architectures.

Total Cost: Consider platform fees, implementation costs, ongoing compute expenses, and partner fees when calculating total cost of ownership.
