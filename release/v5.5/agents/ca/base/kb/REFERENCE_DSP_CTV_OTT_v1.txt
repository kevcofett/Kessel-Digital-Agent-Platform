CTV AND OTT MARKET CONTEXT 2025
----------------------------------------

Market Size and Growth

Connected TV programmatic investment topped nearly USD 25 billion in the United States in 2024 with expectations to reach almost USD 30 billion in 2025. CTVs media budget share is doubling from 14% in 2023 to 28% in 2025, with 72% of marketers planning to increase programmatic CTV investment. An estimated 75% of all connected TV advertising transactions occur programmatically in 2025, democratizing television advertising while improving results for advertisers of all sizes.

CTV vs OTT Definitions

OTT (Over-The-Top) refers to the delivery method of video content via the internet, regardless of device including smartphones, laptops, tablets, or TVs. CTV (Connected TV) is a subset of OTT, referring specifically to content streamed on a television screen via an internet connection. Smart TV operating systems like Samsung Tizen, LG webOS, Roku OS, and Android TV, along with streaming devices like Roku, Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, and Chromecast, are examples of CTV platforms.

CPM Pricing Benchmarks

CTV and OTT advertising costs typically range from USD 10 to USD 65 CPM depending on targeting sophistication, inventory quality, and platform. A good CPM for CTV advertising is typically between USD 25 and USD 35, reflecting advanced targeting and attribution capabilities. Premium platforms typically command USD 25-45 CPM while FAST (Free Ad-Supported Television) channels offer USD 10-20 CPM. For comparison, broadcast and cable linear television CPM averages USD 10-15, and YouTube video CPM averages USD 20-25.

CPM Cost Drivers

CTV CPM varies based on several factors. Targeting sophistication can add USD 2-5 or more per CPM when narrowing by ZIP code, age, gender, or income. High-demand programming like news, sports, or new releases commands premium rates. Ad length affects pricing with 30-second ads typically costing more than 15-second spots. Private marketplace deals often command higher CPMs than open auction buying.

Budget Recommendations

Experts suggest allocating 15-30% of digital advertising budget to CTV for statistically meaningful results. A monthly budget of USD 25,000-50,000 enables solid testing and optimization. Between high CPMs, minimum spend requirements, and the need for multiple platform buys to achieve reach, meaningful CTV campaigns often require USD 100,000 or more monthly budgets. The premium CPMs of USD 25-45 compared to USD 5-10 for standard digital video are offset by 90% or higher completion rates and a premium, engaged viewing environment.
