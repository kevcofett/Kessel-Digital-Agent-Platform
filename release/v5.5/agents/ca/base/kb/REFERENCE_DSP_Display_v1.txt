----------------------------------------
MEDIAMATH BY INFILLION
----------------------------------------

Overview

MediaMath was one of the original programmatic DSPs, founded in 2007. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June 2023 owing USD 125 million to supply chain partners. Infillion acquired MediaMath assets for USD 22 million in September 2023 and relaunched the platform in 2024. The renewed MediaMath focuses on cookieless solutions, supply path optimization, and CTV advertising. Notable: Walmart Connect integrated MediaMath technology to power its retail media DSP.

Current Status and Considerations

MediaMath is now operating as MediaMath by Infillion with renewed focus on CTV, display, and live sports out-of-home advertising. The platform has re-signed major SSPs including PubMatic and Magnite. Platform spending reached a run rate of USD 500,000 per month in early 2024 with month-over-month growth. Advertisers should evaluate the platforms stability and roadmap given the recent ownership change.

Technical Requirements

Data Formats Accepted: Standard programmatic data formats, API integration

Identity Solutions: Cookieless identity solutions, supply path optimization

Integration Status: Re-establishing partner ecosystem post-acquisition

Pricing Model

Pricing details should be obtained directly from Infillion as the platform continues post-acquisition development. Historical MediaMath pricing was competitive with other independent DSPs.

Best Use Cases

MediaMath by Infillion may be suitable for advertisers interested in CTV and sports-focused inventory, those seeking alternatives to major DSPs, or organizations evaluating emerging platforms. Due diligence on platform stability and roadmap is recommended given the 2023-2024 transition.

----------------------------------------
MICROSOFT INVEST (FORMERLY XANDR) - PLATFORM SUNSETTING
----------------------------------------

Overview and Status

Microsoft acquired Xandr from AT&T in 2022 for approximately USD 1 billion and consolidated it under Microsoft Advertising. In May 2025, Microsoft announced that Microsoft Invest DSP will be shut down by February 2026. Microsoft has designated Amazon DSP as the preferred transition partner for existing Microsoft Invest customers.

Migration Guidance

Microsoft Invest customers across North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific regions should plan platform transitions before the February 2026 discontinuation date. Amazon DSP serves as the Microsoft-designated alternative. Microsoft Monetize (the SSP component) will continue operating and has joined Amazons Certified Supply Exchange.

Historical Context

The Xandr/Microsoft Invest shutdown reflects broader DSP market consolidation. Industry analysis suggests the DSP market is moving toward a natural oligopoly dominated by Google, The Trade Desk, and Amazon, with independent DSPs facing challenging economics in a low-margin, high-volume business.
