GROCERY RETAIL MEDIA MARKET CONTEXT 2025
----------------------------------------

Market Size and Growth

Retail media is on track to reach USD 106 billion by 2027. The grocery vertical represents a significant and growing portion of retail media spend as CPG brands shift budgets from traditional trade spending to measurable digital advertising. Amazon dominates overall retail media but grocery-focused networks are capturing increasing share as brands seek to influence in-store purchase decisions where the majority of grocery shopping still occurs.

Key Trends 2025

In-store digital advertising emerged as a major theme in 2025 with Kroger, Albertsons, and Instacart all launching or expanding in-store screen networks. CTV expansion continues with Walmart/Vizio integration and Amazon adding Netflix and Roku inventory. Offsite programmatic capabilities expanded significantly at Kroger and Albertsons to compete with Amazon and Walmart DSP offerings. API-based measurement and data access improved across platforms to support cross-retailer analysis and marketing mix modeling.

Platform Selection Considerations

For maximum reach, Amazon Advertising provides the largest audience across online and CTV with expanding premium inventory. For omnichannel with in-store, Walmart Connect uniquely measures both online and physical store purchases. For data science and targeting, Kroger Precision Marketing leads in targeting effectiveness and measurement per industry rankings. For multi-retailer reach, Instacart Ads provides access to 1,800+ banners through single platform. For regional focus, Albertsons Media Collective provides strong coverage in specific US markets.

These five platforms represent the core grocery RMN ecosystem for CPG advertisers.
