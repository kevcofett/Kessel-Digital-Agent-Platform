SSP Reference Guide

Version 7.0

Last Updated: December 2024

Document Purpose

This reference document provides comprehensive information on Supply-Side Platforms (SSPs) for publisher ad monetization. It covers technical requirements, inventory types, header bidding capabilities, buyer integrations, and pricing models to support vendor evaluation and implementation planning.

Market Overview

The global SSP market is projected to grow at 20.2% CAGR from 2023 to 2028, driven by programmatic advertising expansion, CTV growth, and publisher consolidation around premium platforms. According to Forresters 2024 SSP Wave, Amazon Ads, Magnite, and PubMatic were named Leaders, with Index Exchange, Microsoft, InMobi, and Equativ recognized as Strong Performers. The market continues shifting toward video and CTV inventory, with Magnite positioned as the standard-bearer for programmatic CTV.

Key market trends include sell-side curation enabling publishers to package inventory for buyers, header bidding maturation with server-to-server adoption growing, identity solution integration with UID2, EUID, and alternative IDs, and Supply Path Optimization (SPO) reducing intermediaries between buyers and publishers. Publishers increasingly work with fewer SSPs while demanding transparency, reduced latency, and better yield optimization.

Selection Criteria

When evaluating SSP partners, publishers should consider the following factors.

Demand Quality: Evaluate the SSPs buyer integrations, DSP connections, and advertiser relationships. More demand partners typically means more competitive auctions and higher CPMs.

Channel Fit: Match SSP strengths to your inventory types. Magnite leads for CTV, PubMatic excels across formats, FreeWheel dominates premium video, and others specialize in specific channels.

Header Bidding Capabilities: Assess Prebid compatibility, server-side options, latency impact, and identity solution support. OpenWrap and similar products differentiate SSPs.

Transparency and Trust: Consider auction transparency, payment terms, fee clarity, and sequential liability policies. Publisher-friendly terms vary significantly across SSPs.

Integration Complexity: Evaluate technical requirements against your teams capabilities. Some SSPs offer managed services while others require significant self-service implementation.
