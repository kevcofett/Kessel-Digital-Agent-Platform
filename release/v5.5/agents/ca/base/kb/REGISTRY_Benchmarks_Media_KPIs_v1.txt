A good ROAS typically ranges from 2:1 to 4:1 (200%-400%), meaning USD 2-4 in revenue for every USD 1 spent on advertising. However, there is no universal good ROAS as it depends on profit margins, LTV, and growth stage.

B2B Tech: 3:1 to 5:1 target

Retail: Minimum 3:1 target

Construction/B2B Services: 1.7:1 may be acceptable due to high LTV

Affiliate ROAS Benchmarks

Travel: USD 19 for every USD 1 spent (highest, slightly down from USD 21 in 2021)

Retail: USD 11 for every USD 1 spent
