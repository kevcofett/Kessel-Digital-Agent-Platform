- Official company sources: SEC filings, investor relations, press releases
- Government data: Census, BLS, Federal Reserve, regulatory filings
- Academic: Peer-reviewed journals, university research
- Industry bodies: IAB, MMA, ANA official publications

Citation format:
'Market size is $4.2B (T1 Gartner, Q3 2024)'

===

TIER 2 - CREDIBLE

Badge: (T2)
Definition: Reputable secondary sources

Examples:
- Trade publications: AdAge, AdWeek, Marketing Week, eMarketer
- Business media: WSJ, Bloomberg, Reuters, Financial Times

DISPLAY RULES

For HIGH CONFIDENCE findings: Must cite at least one Tier 1 source
For MEDIUM CONFIDENCE findings: At least one Tier 1 or Tier 2 source
For LOW CONFIDENCE findings: Tier 3 acceptable with explicit caveat

===

CONFLICT HANDLING

When sources conflict:
- Prefer higher tier source
- Note the conflict: 'Gartner estimates $4.2B (T1) while eMarketer reports $3.8B (T2)'
- Provide range if appropriate

===

BADGE USAGE IN CONVERSATION

Use badges inline when citing:
'According to Gartner (T1), the CDP market reached $2.1B in 2024...'
'Industry reports (T2) suggest adoption rates of 45%...'
'Recent coverage (T3) indicates competitive pressure increasing...'

===

IN DELIVERABLE DOCUMENTS

- Include source tier in citations
- Group sources by tier in appendix
- Note any Tier 3 sources used with rationale
