1.1 PURPOSE

This document provides implication mapping for audience targeting decisions. The agent MUST consult this document when users define audience strategies, targeting parameters, or segmentation approaches.

1.2 SCOPE

This document covers implication chains for:
- Audience size decisions
- Targeting precision trade-offs
- First-party versus third-party data strategies
- Lookalike and expansion strategies
- Audience exclusion decisions

================================================================================
SECTION 2: AUDIENCE SIZE IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: audience_size_implications
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 2,3
META_TOPICS: audience_size, narrow_targeting, broad_targeting
META_INTENT: AUDIENCE_TARGETING
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH
META_CHUNK_PRIORITY: 1

2.1 NARROW AUDIENCE (UNDER 500K)

- Week 1-2: Rapid audience saturation possible
- Week 3-4: Frequency escalates quickly within small pool
- Week 5-8: Creative fatigue accelerates
- Month 2-3: Audience exhaustion limits scale
- Long-term: Efficiency may decline as addressable market depletes

2.2 MEDIUM AUDIENCE (500K TO 5M)

- Week 1-2: Balanced reach and frequency build
- Week 3-4: Optimization identifies high-value segments
- Week 5-8: Sustainable pacing without rapid exhaustion
- Month 2-3: Room for audience expansion based on learnings
- Long-term: Sufficient scale for ongoing optimization

2.3 BROAD AUDIENCE (OVER 5M)

- Week 1-2: Slow frequency build across large pool
- Week 3-4: Algorithm optimization surfaces high performers
- Week 5-8: Waste inherent in broad targeting
- Month 2-3: Strong learnings for future refinement
- Long-term: Maximum reach but efficiency trade-offs

2.4 DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS

- What is the estimated addressable market
- What frequency level is appropriate for consideration window
- Is scale or precision the higher priority
- What expansion strategy exists if primary audience saturates

================================================================================
SECTION 3: TARGETING PRECISION TRADE-OFFS
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: precision_tradeoffs
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 2,3,4
META_TOPICS: precision, relevance, reach, targeting_layers
META_INTENT: AUDIENCE_TARGETING
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH

3.1 HIGH-PRECISION TARGETING

- Higher relevance to reached users
- Lower reach within budget
- Higher CPMs due to limited inventory
- Faster audience exhaustion
- Lower waste but potentially missing adjacent opportunities

3.2 LOW-PRECISION TARGETING

- Lower relevance to many reached users
- Higher reach within budget
- Lower CPMs due to abundant inventory
- Slower audience exhaustion
- Higher waste but captures adjacent opportunities

3.3 LAYERED TARGETING

- Each layer reduces addressable audience
- Combined layers create very narrow pools
- Inventory availability decreases with each layer
- CPMs increase with targeting complexity
- Risk of over-engineering audience

SECTION 4: DATA STRATEGY IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: data_strategy_implications
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 2,3
META_TOPICS: first_party_data, third_party_data, lookalikes
META_INTENT: AUDIENCE_TARGETING
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH

4.1 FIRST-PARTY DATA EMPHASIS

Advantages:
- Highest accuracy and relevance
- Differentiated from competitors
- Privacy-compliant by design
- Enables personalization

Limitations:
- Scale constrained by customer base
- Requires infrastructure investment
- May miss prospecting opportunities

4.2 THIRD-PARTY DATA EMPHASIS

Advantages:
- Immediate scale availability
- No infrastructure required
- Good for prospecting

Limitations:
- Declining accuracy due to privacy changes
- Available to competitors
- Regulatory compliance complexity
- Less differentiated

4.3 LOOKALIKE STRATEGY

High-Value Seed Lookalikes:
- Top 10-20% customers by LTV
- Typically 40-60% better CAC than prospecting
- Limited scale

Broad Seed Lookalikes:
- All customers or converters
- Better scale than high-value seeds
- Good balance of efficiency and reach
