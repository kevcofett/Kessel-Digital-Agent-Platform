SECTION 1: PURPOSE AND FUNDAMENTALS
================================================================================

META_TOPICS: purpose, efficiency_paradox, brand_building, demand_generation
META_INTENT: CHANNEL_SELECTION
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH

1.1 PURPOSE

This document provides a framework for balancing brand building and performance marketing investments. Sustainable marketing effectiveness requires both demand generation through brand building and demand harvesting through performance marketing.

1.2 THE EFFICIENCY PARADOX

Performance marketing appears more measurable and efficient but creates hidden dependency:
- Performance channels harvest demand created elsewhere
- Brand advertising generates the demand pool that performance draws from
- Over-investment in performance depletes future demand
- Under-investment in brand reduces performance channel efficiency over time

1.3 LONG AND SHORT OF MARKETING (Binet and Field Research)

Research findings:
- 60 percent brand building and 40 percent activation recommended for most categories
- Brand effects build slowly but create lasting mental availability
- Performance effects work quickly but decay rapidly
- Brands with higher awareness achieve 2.86x higher conversion rates

1.4 MENTAL AND PHYSICAL AVAILABILITY

Brand Building Creates Mental Availability:
- Brand comes to mind when purchase need arises
- Built through reach, frequency, and distinctive assets
- Measured through awareness, consideration, brand equity

Performance Marketing Ensures Physical Availability:
- Brand is present and easy to purchase when ready to buy
- Requires presence at point of decision
- Measured through direct response and conversion

================================================================================
SECTION 2: FUNNEL INVESTMENT FRAMEWORK
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: funnel_investment
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 4,5
META_TOPICS: funnel, upper_funnel, mid_funnel, lower_funnel, allocation
META_INTENT: CHANNEL_SELECTION, BUDGET_PLANNING
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH
META_CHUNK_PRIORITY: 1

2.1 UPPER FUNNEL - AWARENESS AND REACH

Objective: Build mental availability with target audience
Channels: Television, CTV, video, audio, out-of-home, broad reach digital
Metrics: Reach, frequency, brand awareness, brand recall
Timeline: Effects accumulate over months to years
Typical allocation: 30-40 percent of budget

2.2 MID FUNNEL - CONSIDERATION AND ENGAGEMENT

Objective: Move from awareness to active consideration
Channels: Content marketing, social, influencer, educational content
Metrics: Engagement, consideration, brand preference, search volume
Timeline: Effects develop over weeks to months
Typical allocation: 20-30 percent of budget

2.3 LOWER FUNNEL - CONVERSION AND SALES

Objective: Capture demand at point of purchase decision
Channels: Search, retargeting, retail media, direct response
Metrics: Conversions, ROAS, CPA, sales
Timeline: Effects immediate to days
Typical allocation: 30-40 percent of budget

2.4 FUNNEL DYNAMICS

Demand Generation vs Demand Capture:
- Upper and mid funnel generate demand
- Lower funnel captures existing demand
- Performance channels cannot create demand, only harvest it

Funnel Fill Rate:
- Monitor ratio of upper funnel activity to lower funnel conversions
- Declining fill rate indicates brand investment shortage
- Rising CPAs without volume increases suggests demand pool depletion

================================================================================
SECTION 3: ALLOCATION BY BUSINESS MATURITY
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: allocation_by_maturity
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 4,5
META_TOPICS: allocation, business_maturity, new_brand, growth_brand, mature_brand
META_INTENT: BUDGET_PLANNING
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH

3.1 NEW BRAND OR MARKET ENTRY

Typical allocation:
- Upper funnel: 50-60 percent
- Mid funnel: 20-25 percent
- Lower funnel: 20-25 percent

Rationale:
- Must build awareness before harvesting
- Limited existing demand to capture
- Brand building investment creates future efficiency

3.2 GROWTH BRAND

Typical allocation:
- Upper funnel: 35-45 percent
- Mid funnel: 20-30 percent
- Lower funnel: 30-40 percent

Rationale:
- Awareness established, consideration building
- Balanced investment across funnel
- Performance channels becoming efficient

3.3 MATURE BRAND

Typical allocation:
- Upper funnel: 25-35 percent
- Mid funnel: 15-25 percent
- Lower funnel: 40-50 percent

Rationale:
- Strong existing awareness to maintain
- Large consideration set to harvest
- Efficiency optimization prioritized
- Caution: Reducing brand too much depletes demand over time

SECTION 4: MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: brand_measurement
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 8,9
META_TOPICS: brand_metrics, awareness, consideration, equity, measurement
META_INTENT: MEASUREMENT_GUIDANCE
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH

4.1 BRAND METRICS

Awareness Metrics:
- Unaided awareness: Brand comes to mind without prompting
- Aided awareness: Brand recognized when prompted
- Top-of-mind awareness: First brand mentioned in category

Consideration Metrics:
- Consideration set inclusion: Brand among options being evaluated
- Brand preference: Brand favored over alternatives
- Purchase intent: Stated likelihood to purchase

Equity Metrics:
- Brand health index: Composite of awareness, consideration, sentiment
- Price premium: Ability to command higher prices than competitors
- Share of voice: Brand visibility relative to competitors

4.2 CONNECTING BRAND TO PERFORMANCE

Leading indicators of brand health affecting performance:
- Branded search volume trends
- Direct traffic trends
- Organic social mentions
- Category conversion rate trends

When brand metrics decline, performance efficiency typically follows within 3-6 months.

SECTION 5: DIAGNOSTIC SIGNALS
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: brand_diagnostics
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 4,5,9
META_TOPICS: diagnostics, brand_health, performance_efficiency, warning_signs
META_INTENT: CHANNEL_SELECTION, BUDGET_PLANNING
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH

5.1 SIGNS OF BRAND UNDERINVESTMENT

Warning signals:
- Rising performance CPAs without market changes
- Declining branded search volume
- Increasing cost to acquire new customers
- Shrinking consideration set in surveys
- Declining conversion rates on prospecting

Typical implications:
- Demand pool is being depleted
- Competitors gaining mental availability
- Need to rebalance toward upper funnel

5.2 SIGNS OF PERFORMANCE UNDERINVESTMENT

Warning signals:
- Strong awareness but weak conversion
- High consideration but losing at point of purchase
- Competitors winning at decision point
- Poor share of voice in purchase channels

Typical implications:
- Demand exists but is not being captured
- Need presence at point of decision
- Balance toward lower funnel conversion

5.3 OPTIMAL BALANCE INDICATORS

Healthy signals:
- Stable or improving branded search volume
- Consistent new customer acquisition costs
- Growing market share
- Strong conversion rates on prospecting
- Sustainable efficiency across funnel

6.1 WHEN TO RECOMMEND MORE BRAND INVESTMENT

Recommend increasing upper funnel when:
- Performance CPAs rising without market explanation
- Branded search declining
- New customer acquisition becoming harder
- Awareness metrics declining
- Competitor brand investment increasing

6.2 WHEN TO RECOMMEND MORE PERFORMANCE INVESTMENT

Recommend increasing lower funnel when:
- Strong awareness but poor conversion
- High consideration but losing at purchase

- Short-term revenue goals critical

6.3 INTEGRATION BEST PRACTICES

- Maintain minimum 20-30 percent upper funnel for all but most mature brands
- Track brand metrics alongside performance metrics
- Use branded search as proxy for brand health
- Build measurement system that values demand generation
- Avoid optimizing to last-click at expense of demand creation
