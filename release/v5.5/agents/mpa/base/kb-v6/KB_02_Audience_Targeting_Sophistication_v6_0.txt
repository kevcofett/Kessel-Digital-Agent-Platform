1.1 PURPOSE

This document provides guidance on scaling audience definition rigor based on objective type, budget size, and risk profile. It helps determine when to push for more sophistication and when simpler approaches are appropriate.

1.2 CORE PRINCIPLE

Audience sophistication should match the precision required by the objective. Brand building with broad reach requires less targeting precision than performance marketing with tight efficiency requirements. Over-targeting can reduce scale. Under-targeting can waste budget.

================================================================================
SECTION 2: SOPHISTICATION TIERS
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: sophistication_tiers
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 2,3
META_TOPICS: tier_1, tier_2, tier_3, signal_count
META_INTENT: AUDIENCE_TARGETING
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH
META_CHUNK_PRIORITY: 1

2.1 TIER 1 - BROAD REACH (5-10 signals)

Appropriate for: Brand and upper-funnel objectives

Focus:
- Basic demographic alignment
- Broad interest categories
- Contextual relevance
- Geographic targeting

Use when:
- Objective is awareness or consideration
- Audience is broad by design
- Budget is sufficient for wide reach
- Learning is more valuable than immediate efficiency

2.2 TIER 2 - MODERATE PRECISION (10-20 signals)

Appropriate for: Mid-funnel and consideration objectives

Focus:
- Specific behavioral signals
- Purchase intent indicators
- Category interest
- Life-stage targeting

Use when:
- Objective is consideration or preference
- Audience has identifiable characteristics
- Efficiency matters but not primary constraint
- Some testing budget exists

2.3 TIER 3 - HIGH PRECISION (20-40 signals)

Appropriate for: Performance and lower-funnel objectives

Focus:
- Strong intent signals
- Recency indicators
- Custom audiences
- Lookalike expansion from high-value customers

Use when:
- Objective is conversion or revenue
- Efficiency targets are tight
- Data is available to support precision
- Measurement can attribute results

================================================================================
SECTION 3: SIGNAL CATEGORIES
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: signal_categories
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 2,3
META_TOPICS: demographic, behavioral, contextual, intent, psychographic
META_INTENT: AUDIENCE_TARGETING
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH
META_CHUNK_PRIORITY: 1

3.1 DEMOGRAPHIC SIGNALS

Age, gender, income, education, occupation, household composition, life stage.

Foundational but often insufficient alone. Census data provides base population.

3.2 BEHAVIORAL SIGNALS

Past purchase, browsing history, engagement patterns, content consumption, search behavior.

Generally more predictive than demographics. Google In-Market, Meta Behaviors.

3.3 CONTEXTUAL SIGNALS

Content adjacency, time of day, device type, location context.

Increasingly important in privacy-constrained environments. IAB Content Taxonomy.

3.4 INTENT SIGNALS

Search queries, comparison behavior, cart abandonment, pricing page visits.

Strongest performance indicators. Limited availability, often expensive.

3.5 PSYCHOGRAPHIC SIGNALS

Values, attitudes, interests, lifestyle, brand affinity.

Useful for message alignment. Meta Interests, Google Affinity.

SECTION 4: AUDIENCE SIZE AND SCALE
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: audience_scale
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 2,3
META_TOPICS: audience_size, scale_assessment, census_validation
META_INTENT: AUDIENCE_TARGETING
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH

4.1 SIZE CALCULATION

Required reach = Target conversions / Expected CVR / Reach-to-action ratio

If required reach exceeds addressable audience, either objective or audience must adjust.

4.2 CENSUS VALIDATION REQUIREMENT

All audience size estimates must start with census-validated population data. Agent MUST web search for current census data.

4.3 WARNING SIGNS OF MISMATCH

- Very high CPMs from tight targeting
- Rapidly climbing frequency
- Performance degrading as spend increases
- Difficulty achieving spend targets

================================================================================
SECTION 5: SOPHISTICATION SCALING DECISIONS
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: scaling_decisions
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 2,3
META_TOPICS: when_to_push, when_to_simplify, decision_tree
META_INTENT: AUDIENCE_TARGETING
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH

5.1 WHEN TO PUSH FOR MORE SOPHISTICATION

- Efficiency targets are aggressive and data exists
- Performance is below expectation
- Budget supports testing multiple approaches
- Measurement can validate improvement

5.2 WHEN TO ACCEPT SIMPLER APPROACHES

- Objective is reach-oriented
- Data to support sophistication does not exist
- Budget does not support testing
- Measurement cannot validate improvement
