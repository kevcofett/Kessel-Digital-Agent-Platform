1.1 PURPOSE

This document provides diagnostic reasoning patterns and expert-level guidance for measurement and attribution decisions. The agent MUST use this document to identify measurement pitfalls, surface attribution limitations, and ensure plans have valid success criteria.

1.2 SCOPE

This document covers:
- Critical measurement considerations that determine success
- Common pitfalls with recommended alternatives
- Diagnostic signals indicating measurement problems
- Attribution methodology comparison
- Questions worth asking that users may not consider
- Benchmark reference points for measurement setup

SECTION 2: CRITICAL MEASUREMENT CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: measurement_critical_considerations
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 3,8,9
META_TOPICS: metrics, attribution_bias, incrementality, measurement_design
META_INTENT: MEASUREMENT_GUIDANCE
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH

2.1 THE FIVE CRITICAL MEASUREMENT CONSIDERATIONS

CONSIDERATION 1: WHAT YOU MEASURE DETERMINES WHAT YOU OPTIMIZE
Campaigns optimize toward measured outcomes. Flawed metrics produce flawed optimization. If you measure clicks, you get clicks. If you measure value, you get value.

Why it matters: The wrong primary metric can cause campaigns to optimize away from business objectives while appearing successful.

CONSIDERATION 2: ATTRIBUTION HAS KNOWN BIASES
Every attribution model has limitations. Last-click undervalues awareness. Platform attribution overvalues platform touchpoints. No model is truth.

Why it matters: Understanding biases prevents over-reliance on misleading data. Best practice is triangulation across methods.

CONSIDERATION 3: INCREMENTALITY IS THE GOLD STANDARD
Only incremental conversions represent true campaign value. Many attributed conversions would have occurred anyway through organic channels or existing customer behavior.

Why it matters: Scaling based on attributed results without incrementality validation often produces disappointing business outcomes.

CONSIDERATION 4: MEASUREMENT CAPABILITY VARIES BY CHANNEL
Some channels support clean measurement, others do not. CTV is harder to attribute than search. Brand effects are harder to measure than clicks.

Why it matters: Channel selection should consider measurement quality. Heavy investment in unmeasurable channels requires alternative validation.

CONSIDERATION 5: MEASUREMENT DESIGN AFFECTS LEARNING
Good measurement generates learnings that improve future campaigns. Poor measurement produces data but not insight.

Why it matters: Campaigns should teach you something. Measurement design determines whether you learn or just count.

================================================================================
SECTION 3: COMMON PITFALLS
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: measurement_pitfalls
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 3,8,9
META_TOPICS: pitfalls, roas, attribution_windows, single_source, baselines
META_INTENT: MEASUREMENT_GUIDANCE
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH

3.1 PITFALL: ROAS AS PRIMARY KPI

What it looks like:
- Campaign success defined by platform-reported ROAS
- Budget decisions based on channel ROAS comparison
- Scaling to channels with highest reported ROAS

Why it matters:
- Platform ROAS typically overstates true value by 20-50 percent
- Channels that capture existing demand look most efficient
- Lower funnel gets credit for upper funnel work

Better approach:
- Use iROAS (incremental ROAS) validated by testing
- Use MER for portfolio-level efficiency
- Validate high-ROAS channels with incrementality testing before scaling

3.2 PITFALL: LONG ATTRIBUTION WINDOWS WITHOUT VALIDATION

What it looks like:
- 28-day or longer click attribution windows
- High view-through attribution included
- Large volume of conversions attributed

Why it matters:
- Long windows capture conversions that would happen anyway
- View-through especially inflates results
- True campaign impact is overstated

Better approach:
- Start with 7-day click attribution
- Test multiple windows to understand sensitivity
- Add view-through only with holdout validation

3.3 PITFALL: SINGLE-SOURCE ATTRIBUTION

What it looks like:
- Reliance on one platform or tool for all attribution
- No cross-validation of results
- Decisions based on single data source

Why it matters:
- Every source has inherent biases
- Platform attribution favors the platform
- Errors are not caught without triangulation

Better approach:
- Use multiple measurement methods
- Compare platform attribution to MER trends
- Validate with incrementality testing

3.4 PITFALL: MEASURING WHAT IS EASY INSTEAD OF WHAT MATTERS

What it looks like:
- Focus on clicks, impressions, and engagement
- Limited connection to business outcomes
- Proxies substituted for actual objectives

Better approach:
- Define business outcome KPIs first
- Connect proxy metrics to outcomes with validation
- Accept measurement latency for accurate data

3.5 PITFALL: NO BASELINE OR CONTROL

What it looks like:
- All budget allocated to active campaigns
- No holdout for comparison
- Cannot separate campaign effect from organic

Better approach:
- Maintain geographic or audience holdouts
- Use 5-10 percent of budget or audience for control
- Rotate holdouts to validate ongoing

SECTION 4: DIAGNOSTIC SIGNALS
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: measurement_diagnostics
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 8,9
META_TOPICS: diagnostics, attribution_discrepancies, roas_variance, incrementality
META_INTENT: MEASUREMENT_GUIDANCE
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH

4.1 IF ATTRIBUTED CONVERSIONS EXCEED BUSINESS RESULTS

What to check:
- Are multiple channels claiming same conversions
- Is attribution window too long
- Are view-through conversions included

Typical implications:
- Attribution is overstating impact
- Need to deduplicate or adjust methodology
- Incrementality testing required for validation

4.2 IF CHANNEL ROAS VARIES DRAMATICALLY

What to check:
- Are channels at different funnel stages
- Are attribution windows consistent
- Is one channel getting credit for another work

Typical implications:
- Lower funnel typically shows higher ROAS but lower incrementality
- Upper funnel contribution is undervalued
- Need holistic view, not channel comparison

4.3 IF PERFORMANCE LOOKS GREAT BUT BUSINESS RESULTS LAG

What to check:
- Are metrics connected to actual business outcomes
- Is measurement capturing right conversions
- Are there delays in outcome realization

Typical implications:
- Metrics may not correlate with business outcomes
- Need to validate measurement against business results
- May be optimizing for wrong objectives

4.4 IF INCREMENTALITY RESULTS ARE LOWER THAN ATTRIBUTION

What to check:
- How much was baseline or organic activity
- Which channels have lowest incrementality
- What portion of conversions would happen anyway

Typical implications:
- Attribution overstated true impact
- Some channels are capturing not creating demand
- Budget reallocation may improve true efficiency

SECTION 5: ATTRIBUTION METHODOLOGY COMPARISON
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: attribution_methodologies
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 3,8
META_TOPICS: last_click, multi_touch, mmm, incrementality_testing, triangulation
META_INTENT: MEASUREMENT_GUIDANCE
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH

5.1 LAST-CLICK ATTRIBUTION

How it works: 100 percent credit to final touchpoint before conversion

Strengths:
- Simple and easy to understand
- Provides clear channel credit
- Actionable for direct response

Weaknesses:
- Ignores all prior touchpoints
- Undervalues awareness and consideration
- Favors lower-funnel channels

When to use: Short purchase cycles, single-channel campaigns

5.2 MULTI-TOUCH ATTRIBUTION

How it works: Distributes credit across multiple touchpoints (rules-based or algorithmic)

Strengths:
- Recognizes journey complexity
- More balanced than last-click
- Can reveal channel interactions

Weaknesses:
- Requires significant data
- Model assumptions affect results
- Still based on observed conversions only

When to use: Longer purchase cycles, multi-channel campaigns

5.3 MEDIA MIX MODELING (MMM)

How it works: Statistical regression on aggregate data separating marketing from baseline

Strengths:
- Does not require user-level tracking
- Works across all channels including offline
- Accounts for external factors

Weaknesses:
- Requires 2-3 years historical data
- Aggregate level, not user level
- Significant expertise required

When to use: Large budgets, privacy-constrained environments

5.4 INCREMENTALITY TESTING

How it works: Compare test group to control group to measure lift

Strengths:
- Measures true causal impact
- Gold standard for validation
- Works for any channel or tactic

Weaknesses:
- Requires dedicated budget or audience
- Foregoes some conversions for measurement
- Statistical expertise required

When to use: Validating channel contribution, before major scaling decisions

5.5 MEASUREMENT TRIANGULATION

How it works: Use multiple methods and compare to build confidence

Strengths:
- Reduces reliance on any single method
- Catches errors and biases
- Builds more complete picture

When to use: Always to some degree, especially for major decisions

- Retargeting: 30-50 percent incremental
- Prospecting social: 40-60 percent incremental
- CTV and video: 60-80 percent incremental
- Display prospecting: 30-50 percent incremental

These are approximate ranges. Actual incrementality varies by advertiser and context.

7.3 TEST DESIGN BENCHMARKS

Recommended parameters for incrementality testing:
- Minimum test duration: 4 weeks
- Control holdout size: 5-10 percent of budget or audience
- Statistical significance target: 90-95 percent confidence
- Minimum detectable effect: Define before test begins

7.4 ROAS VERSUS iROAS BENCHMARKS

Typical relationship:
- Platform ROAS typically 20-50 percent higher than true iROAS
- Gap is largest for lower-funnel channels
- Gap is smallest for upper-funnel channels
- Specific gap should be validated by testing
