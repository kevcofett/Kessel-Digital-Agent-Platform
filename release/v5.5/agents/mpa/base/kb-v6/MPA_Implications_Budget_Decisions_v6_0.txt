1.1 PURPOSE

This document provides comprehensive implication mapping for budget decisions. The agent MUST consult this document when users propose budget changes and MUST articulate second-order and third-order effects before proceeding. Expert advisors never simply execute budget changes without helping clients understand downstream implications.

1.2 SCOPE

This document covers implication chains for:
- Total budget increases
- Total budget decreases
- Channel-to-channel reallocations
- Pacing and timing adjustments
- Flexibility allocation decisions

================================================================================
SECTION 2: BUDGET INCREASE IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: budget_increase_implications
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 5,6
META_TOPICS: budget_increase, scaling, volume_effects, diminishing_returns
META_INTENT: BUDGET_PLANNING
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH
META_CHUNK_PRIORITY: 1

2.1 IMMEDIATE EFFECTS (WEEK 1-2)

- Increased impression volume requires creative fatigue monitoring
- Higher spend velocity may trigger platform learning phase resets
- Audience expansion occurs as frequency caps are reached faster
- Competitive dynamics shift as share of voice increases

2.2 MEDIUM-TERM EFFECTS (WEEKS 3-8)

- Diminishing returns begin appearing at 120-150 percent of baseline
- Cost per acquisition often rises 10-20 percent before stabilizing
- Incremental reach slows as core audiences saturate
- Cross-channel attribution becomes more complex

2.3 LONG-TERM EFFECTS (MONTHS 2-6)

- Brand awareness metrics respond with 6-12 week lag
- Customer lifetime value cohorts need 90+ days to validate
- Competitive response typically occurs within 60-90 days
- Market share gains require sustained investment to maintain

2.4 DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS

- What triggered this increase and is the driver sustainable
- Are current channels already showing diminishing returns signals
- Is creative pipeline sufficient to support increased volume
- What success metrics will validate the increased investment

================================================================================
SECTION 3: BUDGET DECREASE IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: budget_decrease_implications
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 5,6
META_TOPICS: budget_decrease, pullback, efficiency, demand_generation
META_INTENT: BUDGET_PLANNING
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH
META_CHUNK_PRIORITY: 1

3.1 IMMEDIATE EFFECTS (WEEK 1-2)

- Reduced frequency may push below effective threshold
- Platform algorithms may deprioritize campaigns with lower spend
- Audience reach contracts to highest-propensity segments
- Share of voice decreases relative to competitors

3.2 MEDIUM-TERM EFFECTS (WEEKS 3-8)

- Pipeline velocity slows with 4-6 week lag
- Brand awareness metrics begin declining after 8 weeks
- Cost efficiency may temporarily improve as waste is eliminated
- Competitor share of voice increases proportionally

3.3 LONG-TERM EFFECTS (MONTHS 2-6)

- Demand generation deficit compounds over time
- Customer acquisition costs rise as warm audiences shrink
- Market position becomes harder to regain after extended pullback
- Brand equity erosion accelerates after 3-4 months of reduced presence

3.4 DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS

- Is this reduction permanent or temporary with restoration timeline
- Which business objective is being deprioritized
- What monitoring will trigger restoration of funding
- Are there efficiency opportunities before reducing total budget

================================================================================
SECTION 4: CHANNEL REALLOCATION IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: channel_reallocation_implications
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 4,5,6
META_TOPICS: reallocation, funnel_shift, channel_shift, learning_phase
META_INTENT: BUDGET_PLANNING, CHANNEL_SELECTION
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH
META_CHUNK_PRIORITY: 1

4.1 UPPER FUNNEL TO LOWER FUNNEL SHIFT

When reallocating from awareness to conversion channels:
- Short-term efficiency metrics typically improve
- Lead volume may increase for 4-8 weeks
- Demand generation deficit emerges at 8-12 weeks
- Customer acquisition costs rise as warm audiences deplete
- Brand awareness begins declining after 6-8 weeks

4.2 LOWER FUNNEL TO UPPER FUNNEL SHIFT

When reallocating from conversion to awareness channels:
- Short-term efficiency metrics typically decline
- Lead volume decreases for 4-8 weeks
- Brand metrics begin improving at 6-12 weeks
- Long-term CAC improvement possible after 3-4 months
- Sales cycle may lengthen during transition

4.3 BETWEEN CHANNELS AT SAME FUNNEL STAGE

When reallocating between peer channels:
- Learning phase disruption in both source and destination channels
- Audience overlap effects may be positive or negative
- Platform algorithm resets require 2-3 weeks to stabilize
- Creative requirements may differ significantly

4.4 DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS

- What performance signal is driving this reallocation
- Have you isolated channel effect from creative or audience effects
- What is the timeline for evaluating the reallocation success
- Is the source channel truly underperforming or facing temporary headwinds

================================================================================
SECTION 5: PACING AND TIMING IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: pacing_timing_implications
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 5,7
META_TOPICS: pacing, timing, front_loading, back_loading, flighting
META_INTENT: BUDGET_PLANNING
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH

5.1 FRONT-LOADING BUDGET

When accelerating spend earlier in campaign period:
- Competitive positioning advantage during high-intent periods
- Risk of creative fatigue before campaign completion
- May exhaust optimal audience segments prematurely
- Limited flexibility for in-flight optimization

5.2 BACK-LOADING BUDGET

When reserving budget for later in campaign period:
- Risk of under-delivery if channels cannot absorb increased spend
- May miss early-period high-intent audiences
- Platform algorithms may favor competitors during light periods
- Provides optimization learning before scaling

5.3 EVEN PACING

When distributing budget evenly across campaign period:
- Balanced reach and frequency throughout flight
- May underinvest during peak opportunity periods
- Predictable performance patterns for forecasting
- Reduced risk of delivery issues

================================================================================
SECTION 6: FLEXIBILITY ALLOCATION IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: flexibility_implications
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 5,6
META_TOPICS: flexibility, reserve_budget, optimization_opportunity
META_INTENT: BUDGET_PLANNING
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH

6.1 HIGH FLEXIBILITY RESERVE (20-30 PERCENT)

When holding significant budget in reserve:
- Maximum optimization opportunity during flight
- Lower initial reach and frequency
- Competitive disadvantage during campaign launch
- Requires robust in-flight decision framework

6.2 LOW FLEXIBILITY RESERVE (5-10 PERCENT)

When committing most budget upfront:
- Maximum initial reach and frequency
- Limited ability to respond to performance signals
- Reduced optimization opportunity
- Higher risk if initial strategy underperforms
