1.1 PURPOSE

This document provides comprehensive implication mapping for channel mix decisions. The agent MUST consult this document when users propose adding, removing, or significantly adjusting channel allocations. Expert advisors never simply execute channel changes without helping clients understand downstream implications.

1.2 SCOPE

This document covers implication chains for:
- Adding new channels to media mix
- Removing channels from media mix
- Shifting budget between channel tiers
- Changing channel role assignments
- Cross-channel interaction effects

SECTION 2: ADDING CHANNELS - TIMELINE IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: channel_addition_implications
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 4,5,6
META_TOPICS: channel_addition, learning_phase, timeline_effects
META_INTENT: CHANNEL_SELECTION
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH
META_CHUNK_PRIORITY: 1

2.1 PAID SEARCH ADDITION

- Week 1-4: Captures existing demand, attribution shifts from upper-funnel
- Week 5-8: Brand term bidding becomes competitive consideration
- Month 2-3: Non-brand performance stabilizes after learning phase
- Long-term: Dependent channel requiring ongoing upper-funnel support

2.2 PAID SOCIAL ADDITION

- Week 1-4: Audience targeting requires 2-3 week learning phase
- Week 5-8: Creative performance patterns emerge, fatigue begins
- Month 2-3: Platform algorithm optimization reaches plateau
- Long-term: Requires consistent creative refresh cycle

2.3 PROGRAMMATIC DISPLAY ADDITION

- Week 1-4: Broad reach at low CPM, limited direct response
- Week 5-8: Retargeting pools build, viewability monitoring critical
- Month 2-3: Cross-channel attribution effects become measurable
- Long-term: Contributes to awareness, rarely drives direct conversion

2.4 CTV/OTT ADDITION

- Week 1-4: Premium inventory at higher CPMs
- Week 5-8: Frequency management across platforms challenging
- Month 2-3: Brand awareness lift measurable through surveys
- Long-term: Requires minimum 8-12 week flights for impact

2.5 INFLUENCER ADDITION

- Week 1-4: Long lead times for creator relationships
- Week 5-8: Engagement patterns differ from traditional channels
- Month 2-3: Attribution challenging due to indirect response path
- Long-term: Audience trust builds over sustained relationships

2.6 DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS FOR ADDITION

- What objective does this channel serve that current mix does not address
- What is the minimum viable budget for this channel to be effective
- What measurement approach will validate contribution
- What internal capabilities exist to manage this channel

SECTION 3: REMOVING CHANNELS - FUNNEL TIER IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: channel_removal_implications
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 4,5,6
META_TOPICS: channel_removal, funnel_effects, demand_generation
META_INTENT: CHANNEL_SELECTION
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH
META_CHUNK_PRIORITY: 1

3.1 IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF ANY REMOVAL

- Attribution shifts to remaining channels within 1-2 weeks
- Audience touchpoint frequency decreases
- Cross-channel synergy effects diminish
- Competitor share of voice in that channel increases

3.2 UPPER-FUNNEL REMOVAL IMPLICATIONS

- Week 1-4: Lower-funnel efficiency may temporarily appear to improve
- Week 5-8: Demand generation deficit begins emerging
- Month 2-3: Pipeline velocity slows as warm audiences shrink
- Month 4-6: Customer acquisition costs rise significantly
- Long-term: Brand awareness and consideration metrics decline

3.3 MID-FUNNEL REMOVAL IMPLICATIONS

- Week 1-4: Upper-to-lower funnel conversion rate declines
- Week 5-8: Sales cycle lengthens without nurturing touchpoints
- Month 2-3: Lead quality may decline without consideration content
- Long-term: Overall marketing efficiency typically declines

3.4 LOWER-FUNNEL REMOVAL IMPLICATIONS

- Week 1-4: Immediate revenue impact measurable
- Week 5-8: Upper-funnel channels appear less efficient
- Month 2-3: Competitor captures demand you generated
- Long-term: Return on upper-funnel investment harder to demonstrate

3.5 DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS FOR REMOVAL

- What performance data suggests this channel is underperforming
- Have you isolated channel effect from creative, audience, or timing effects
- What happens to the audience this channel was reaching
- How will you measure the impact on remaining channels

SECTION 4: CHANNEL TIER SHIFTS
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: channel_tier_shifts
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 4,5,6
META_TOPICS: tier_shifts, awareness_to_performance, performance_to_awareness
META_INTENT: CHANNEL_SELECTION, BUDGET_PLANNING
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH

4.1 AWARENESS TO PERFORMANCE SHIFT

- Week 1-2: Performance metrics appear to improve immediately
- Week 3-6: Lead volume may increase short-term
- Week 7-12: Demand generation deficit emerges
- Month 3-6: Customer acquisition costs rise as warm audiences deplete

4.2 PERFORMANCE TO AWARENESS SHIFT

- Week 1-2: Immediate efficiency decline, volume drop
- Week 3-6: Brand metrics begin improving slowly
- Week 7-12: Pipeline quality may improve
- Month 3-6: Long-term CAC improvement possible

4.3 SHIFT TIMING CONSIDERATIONS

Allow 8-12 weeks minimum before evaluating major tier shifts. Short-term metrics often mislead. Track both efficiency and volume metrics through transition.
