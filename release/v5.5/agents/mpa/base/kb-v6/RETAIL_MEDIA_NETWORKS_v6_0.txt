META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 4,5
META_TOPICS: network_selection, endemic_vs_noendemic, budget_thresholds
META_INTENT: CHANNEL_SELECTION
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH
META_CHUNK_PRIORITY: 1

3.1 ENDEMIC VS NON-ENDEMIC ADVERTISERS

- Direct sales attribution available
- ROAS measurement straightforward
- Strong lower-funnel performance

- Attribution relies on surveys or modeling
- Higher CPMs for premium audiences

- Consider geographic coverage for regional campaigns
- Evaluate category penetration and relevance

Measurement Capabilities:
- Closed-loop attribution requirements
- In-store sales inclusion (Walmart advantage)

Minimum Investment Thresholds:
- Amazon Sponsored: $10K+ per month for optimization

================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: rmn_measurement
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 8,9
META_TOPICS: attribution, incrementality, closed_loop, roas_measurement
META_INTENT: MEASUREMENT_GUIDANCE
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH

4.1 CLOSED-LOOP ATTRIBUTION

RMN Advantage:
- Direct connection between ad exposure and purchase
- No modeling required for on-platform sales
- SKU-level attribution available
- Both online and in-store attribution (varies by network)

Limitations:
- Platform-reported ROAS may include organic sales
- View-through attribution windows vary
- Cross-network attribution challenging
- Incrementality validation still recommended

4.2 INCREMENTALITY TESTING IN RETAIL MEDIA

Geographic Holdouts:
- Most reliable method for RMN incrementality
- Requires 4-8 week test periods
- Control regions receive no RMN investment
- Compare sales lift vs control

Typical Incrementality Findings:
- Sponsored Products: 30-50 percent incremental
- Sponsored Display: 40-60 percent incremental
- Off-Site: 50-70 percent incremental (higher because audience is not already shopping)

4.3 ROAS BENCHMARKS BY NETWORK

Amazon Sponsored Products: 3-7x ROAS
Amazon DSP: 1.5-3x ROAS
Walmart Sponsored Search: 4-6x ROAS
Instacart Sponsored: 2-5x ROAS
