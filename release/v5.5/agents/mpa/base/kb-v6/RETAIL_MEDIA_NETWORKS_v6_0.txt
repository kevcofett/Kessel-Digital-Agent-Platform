SECTION 3: RMN PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: rmn_planning
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 4,5,6
META_TOPICS: planning_considerations, endemic_vs_noendemic, budget_allocation
META_INTENT: CHANNEL_SELECTION, BUDGET_PLANNING
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH
META_CHUNK_PRIORITY: 1

3.1 ENDEMIC VS NON-ENDEMIC ADVERTISERS

Endemic Advertisers (Products Sold at Retailer):
- Direct sales attribution available
- Sponsored Products most relevant
- Consider retail margin plus advertising cost in ROAS calculation
- Balance organic ranking with paid visibility

Non-Endemic Advertisers (Products Not Sold at Retailer):
- Limited to DSP and display inventory
- Audience data targeting primary value
- No direct sales attribution in most cases
- Often used for upper-funnel awareness

3.2 BUDGET ALLOCATION GUIDANCE

Minimum Investment Thresholds:
- Amazon Sponsored Products: $10K/month minimum for meaningful data
- Amazon DSP: $35K/month minimum typical
- Walmart Connect: $10K/month minimum
- Smaller RMNs: $5-10K/month minimum

Allocation by Objective:
- Conversion focus: 60-70% Sponsored Products, 30-40% Display
- Awareness focus: 30-40% Sponsored Products, 60-70% DSP/Display
- Full-funnel: 50% Sponsored, 30% Display, 20% Video/CTV

3.3 MEASUREMENT CONSIDERATIONS

Closed-Loop Attribution:
- RMNs provide deterministic sales attribution
- Compare to platform-reported ROAS with caution
- Incrementality testing still recommended for validation

Cross-Retailer Measurement Challenges:
- Each RMN reports only their sales
- No unified view across retailers
- Consider MMM for total portfolio view

SECTION 4: COMMON PITFALLS
================================================================================

META_SECTION_ID: rmn_pitfalls
META_WORKFLOW_STEPS: 4,5
META_TOPICS: pitfalls, common_mistakes, optimization
META_INTENT: CHANNEL_SELECTION
META_CONFIDENCE: HIGH

4.1 PITFALL: IGNORING TOTAL ECONOMICS

What it looks like:
- Evaluating ROAS without considering retail margin
- Comparing RMN ROAS to direct-to-consumer ROAS
- Overlooking fulfillment and platform fees

Better approach:
- Calculate net margin after all fees
- Use contribution margin ROAS for comparison
- Model total customer value across channels

4.2 PITFALL: TREATING ALL RMNs IDENTICALLY

What it looks like:
- Same strategy across Amazon, Walmart, Target
- Ignoring audience composition differences
- Uniform creative across platforms

Better approach:
- Tailor strategy to each retailer's audience
- Consider shopper mission differences
- Optimize creative for each platform's format

4.3 PITFALL: OVER-INDEXING ON LAST-CLICK

What it looks like:
- Only measuring Sponsored Products conversions
- Ignoring brand-building display and video
- Cutting upper-funnel RMN investment

Better approach:
- Measure new-to-brand customer acquisition
- Track brand search lift from display
- Balance short-term ROAS with long-term growth
