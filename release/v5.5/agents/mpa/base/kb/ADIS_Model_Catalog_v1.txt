MODEL SELECTION GUIDANCE

For customer understanding start with RFM to establish behavioral segments.

For value analysis use Decile to understand concentration and Deterministic CLV for projections.

For retention focus use Cohort analysis to identify lifecycle patterns.

For sophisticated projections use Probabilistic CLV when data requirements are met.

For behavioral discovery use K-Means when segments should emerge from data patterns.

For targeting optimization use Propensity models when labeled outcomes are available.

For treatment allocation use Uplift models when understanding incremental impact is critical.
