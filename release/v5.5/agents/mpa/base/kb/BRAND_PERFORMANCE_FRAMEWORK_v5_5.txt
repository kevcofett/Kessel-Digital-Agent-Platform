PURPOSE

This document provides a framework for balancing brand building and performance marketing investments. While MPA emphasizes incrementality-first measurement and skepticism of flawed metrics like ROAS, sustainable marketing effectiveness requires both demand generation through brand building and demand harvesting through performance marketing. This guide enables recommendations that optimize the full marketing system rather than individual channel efficiency.

================================================================================

SECTION 1 - BRAND AND PERFORMANCE FUNDAMENTALS

THE EFFICIENCY PARADOX

Performance marketing appears more measurable and efficient but creates a hidden dependency:

- Performance channels harvest demand created elsewhere
- Brand advertising generates the demand pool that performance draws from
- Over-investment in performance depletes future demand
- Under-investment in brand reduces performance channel efficiency over time

The most efficient performance marketing exists when strong brand awareness creates abundant demand to capture.

LONG AND SHORT OF MARKETING

Research by Les Binet and Peter Field demonstrates optimal marketing balance:

Research Findings
- 60 percent brand building and 40 percent activation recommended for most categories
- Brand effects build slowly but create lasting mental availability
- Performance effects work quickly but decay rapidly
- Brands with higher awareness achieve 2.86x higher conversion rates
- Brand price premium enables margin that funds performance investment

Why This Matters
- Brands over-investing in performance show declining efficiency over time
- Short-term optimization drives long-term market share erosion
- Category purchase cycles influence optimal balance
- Digital channels often skew portfolios toward performance

MENTAL AVAILABILITY AND PHYSICAL AVAILABILITY

Brand Building Creates Mental Availability
- Brand comes to mind when purchase need arises
- Built through reach, frequency, and distinctive assets
- Requires consistent investment over time
- Measured through awareness, consideration, and brand equity metrics

Performance Marketing Ensures Physical Availability
- Brand is present and easy to purchase when ready to buy
- Requires presence at point of decision
- Can be optimized in near-real-time
- Measured through direct response and conversion metrics

Both Are Necessary
- Mental availability without physical availability loses sales at decision point
- Physical availability without mental availability requires inefficient conquest
- Optimal system maximizes both dimensions

================================================================================

SECTION 2 - FUNNEL FRAMEWORK

FULL FUNNEL INVESTMENT

Upper Funnel - Awareness and Reach
- Objective: Build mental availability with target audience
- Channels: Television, CTV, video, audio, out-of-home, broad reach digital
- Metrics: Reach, frequency, brand awareness, brand recall
- Timeline: Effects accumulate over months to years
- Typical allocation: 30 to 40 percent of budget

Mid Funnel - Consideration and Engagement
- Objective: Move from awareness to active consideration
- Channels: Content marketing, social, influencer, educational content
- Metrics: Engagement, consideration, brand preference, search volume
- Timeline: Effects develop over weeks to months
- Typical allocation: 20 to 30 percent of budget

Lower Funnel - Conversion and Sales
- Objective: Capture demand at point of purchase decision
- Channels: Search, retargeting, retail media, direct response
- Metrics: Conversions, ROAS, CPA, sales
- Timeline: Effects immediate to days
- Typical allocation: 30 to 40 percent of budget

FUNNEL DYNAMICS

Demand Generation Versus Demand Capture
- Upper and mid funnel generate demand
- Lower funnel captures existing demand
- Performance channels cannot create demand they can only harvest it
- Sustainable growth requires balanced investment across funnel

Funnel Leakage Points
- Awareness without consideration: Messaging or positioning problem
- Consideration without conversion: Offer or availability problem
- Conversion without retention: Product or experience problem

Funnel Fill Rate
- Monitor ratio of upper funnel activity to lower funnel conversions
- Declining fill rate indicates brand investment shortage
- Rising CPAs without volume increases suggests demand pool depletion

================================================================================

SECTION 3 - MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK

BRAND METRICS

Awareness Metrics
- Unaided awareness: Brand comes to mind without prompting
- Aided awareness: Brand recognized when prompted
- Top-of-mind awareness: First brand mentioned in category
- Category entry points: Brand associations with purchase situations

Consideration Metrics
- Consideration set inclusion: Brand is among options being evaluated
- Brand preference: Brand favored over alternatives
- Purchase intent: Stated likelihood to purchase
- Net promoter score: Likelihood to recommend

Equity Metrics
- Brand health index: Composite of awareness, consideration, and sentiment
- Brand momentum: Change in brand metrics over time
- Price premium: Ability to command higher prices than competitors
- Share of voice: Brand visibility relative to competitors

PERFORMANCE METRICS

Efficiency Metrics
- Cost per acquisition (CPA): Spend per converted customer
- Return on ad spend (ROAS): Revenue attributed to advertising
- Conversion rate: Conversions divided by opportunities
- Cost per click (CPC): Spend per click

Volume Metrics
- Total conversions: Absolute number of converted customers
- Revenue: Total attributed sales
- Customer acquisition volume: New customers added
- Market share: Sales relative to total market

Quality Metrics
- Customer lifetime value (LTV): Long-term value of acquired customers
- LTV to CAC ratio: Value generated relative to acquisition cost
- New-to-brand rate: Percentage of customers new to brand
- Repeat purchase rate: Customer retention and loyalty

UNIFIED METRICS

Marketing Efficiency Ratio (MER)
- Total revenue divided by total marketing spend
- Captures full marketing contribution regardless of attribution
- Not subject to channel-level attribution biases
- Provides holistic efficiency view

Formula: MER = Total Revenue / Total Marketing Spend

Interpretation
- Higher MER indicates more efficient overall marketing
- Compare MER over time and against benchmarks
- MER above 3 to 5x generally indicates healthy efficiency
- Declining MER may indicate brand erosion or market changes

New Customer Revenue Percentage
- Revenue from new customers divided by total revenue
- Indicates sustainable growth versus repeat buyer dependency
- Should typically be 20 to 40 percent for healthy growth
- Declining percentage indicates customer acquisition challenges

Incremental Revenue Per Dollar Spent
- True incremental revenue divided by marketing spend
- Accounts for sales that would occur without marketing
- Most accurate measure of marketing contribution
- Requires incrementality testing to calculate

MEASUREMENT TRIANGULATION

Why Triangulation Matters
- No single metric captures full marketing impact
- Different methodologies have different biases
- Triangulation improves confidence in conclusions
- Reveals inconsistencies requiring investigation

Recommended Measurement Stack
- Attribution: Provides directional channel insights with known limitations
- Incrementality testing: Validates true channel contribution
- Media mix modeling: Allocates credit across channels holistically
- Brand tracking: Monitors upstream brand health
- Unified metrics (MER): Provides business-level efficiency view

Reconciliation Approach
- Compare results across methodologies
- Investigate significant discrepancies
- Use incrementality as truth calibration
- Weight decisions toward validated measures

================================================================================

SECTION 4 - BUDGET ALLOCATION FRAMEWORK

BASELINE ALLOCATION

Category-Based Starting Points

Long Purchase Cycle Categories (Auto, Financial Services, B2B)
- Brand building: 70 to 80 percent
- Performance: 20 to 30 percent
- Rationale: Extended consideration requires sustained mental availability

Short Purchase Cycle Categories (CPG, Retail, E-commerce)
- Brand building: 50 to 60 percent
- Performance: 40 to 50 percent
- Rationale: Frequent purchases allow more performance optimization

New or Growing Brands
- Brand building: 60 to 70 percent
- Performance: 30 to 40 percent
- Rationale: Must establish mental availability before harvesting

Mature or Dominant Brands
- Brand building: 50 to 60 percent
- Performance: 40 to 50 percent
- Rationale: Can harvest established awareness more heavily

Challenger Brands
- Brand building: 70 to 80 percent
- Performance: 20 to 30 percent
- Rationale: Must build differentiation to compete

ADJUSTMENT FACTORS

Increase Brand Investment When
- Brand awareness below category leaders
- Consideration or preference declining
- Performance channel CPAs rising without volume gains

- Measurable and optimizable
- Increasingly competitive and costly
- Brand terms versus non-brand distinction critical

Retail Media
- Demand capture at purchase point
- First-party data targeting
- Closed-loop measurement advantage
- Endemic advertisers primarily

Social Performance (Meta, TikTok)
- Direct response with targeting
- Increasingly automated optimization
- Lower funnel social requires brand presence
- Measurement relies on platform attribution

Retargeting
- Re-engage interested prospects
- High efficiency but limited scale
- Risk of wasted spend on inevitable converters
- Incrementality testing essential

Affiliate and Partner Marketing
- Performance-based compensation
- Extends reach through partners
- Fraud and brand safety considerations
- Last-click attribution often overstates contribution

HYBRID CHANNELS

Social Media (Brand and Performance)
- Brand awareness through organic and paid content

================================================================================

SECTION 6 - BRAND INVESTMENT VALIDATION

BRAND LIFT STUDIES

Purpose
- Measure attitudinal change from advertising exposure
- Validate brand investment effectiveness
- Compare creative and channel performance
- Guide future brand investment decisions

Methodology
- Control group of unexposed audience
- Test group of exposed audience
- Survey both groups on brand metrics
- Calculate lift as difference between groups

Key Metrics

- Control for other marketing activity
- Test across multiple flights for reliability
- Segment results by audience and creative
- Correlate brand lift with business outcomes

ECONOMETRIC VALIDATION

Media Mix Modeling for Brand
- Include brand metrics as outcomes, not just sales
- Model awareness and consideration alongside revenue
- Understand contribution of brand channels to downstream metrics
- Optimize allocation across full funnel

Validated Coefficients
- Brand channel coefficients should show positive contribution
- Longer decay rates expected for brand versus performance
- Interaction effects between brand and performance
- Diminishing returns at high frequency

Long-Term Effect Measurement
- Base sales analysis shows brand contribution
- Year-over-year baseline growth indicates brand building
- Price elasticity improvement signals brand strength
- Promotional response decay indicates brand health

================================================================================

SECTION 7 - INTEGRATION BEST PRACTICES

CREATIVE CONSISTENCY

Across Funnel Alignment
- Consistent brand identity from awareness to conversion
- Message hierarchy from broad to specific
- Visual continuity through distinctive assets
- Tone consistency across channels

Distinctive Brand Assets
- Logo, colors, and visual identity
- Sonic branding and audio cues
- Taglines and messaging frameworks
- Character or celebrity associations
- Consistent application across touchpoints

MESSAGE SEQUENCING

Optimal Exposure Path
- Brand message establishes awareness and interest
- Consideration content provides reasons to believe
- Performance messaging drives action
- Retargeting reminds and converts

Frequency Management
- Optimal frequency varies by objective
- Brand building benefits from moderate frequency over time
- Performance benefits from higher frequency at decision point
- Cross-channel frequency often unmanaged and excessive
- Consider total exposure, not just channel-level

ORGANIZATIONAL ALIGNMENT

Breaking Silos
- Brand and performance teams often separate
- Unified measurement enables collaboration
- Shared objectives align incentives
- Regular cross-functional planning

Budget Process
- Allocate at portfolio level before channel level
- Fund brand building with protected budget
- Performance budgets should flex with demand
- Avoid shifting brand budget to performance for short-term gains

Reporting Integration
- Combined dashboards showing full funnel
- MER alongside channel metrics
- Brand health alongside performance results
- Business outcomes anchoring both

================================================================================

SECTION 8 - DECISION GUIDANCE FOR MEDIA PLANNERS

ALLOCATION RECOMMENDATION FRAMEWORK

Step 1 - Assess Brand Health
- What is current aided and unaided awareness?
- How does consideration compare to competitors?
- Is brand preference stable, growing, or declining?
- What is share of voice versus market share?

Step 2 - Analyze Performance Trends
- Are performance CPAs increasing over time?
- Is conversion volume growing, stable, or declining?
- What is the new-to-brand rate trend?
- Is MER improving or deteriorating?

Step 3 - Diagnose Current State
- Brand strong, performance weak: Increase performance, capture latent demand
- Performance strong, brand weak: Increase brand, refill demand pool
- Both strong: Maintain balance, optimize efficiency
- Both weak: Prioritize brand to establish foundation

Step 4 - Recommend Allocation
- Use category baseline as starting point
- Apply diagnosis-based adjustments
- Ensure measurement plan accompanies allocation
- Set checkpoints for reassessment

COMMON SCENARIOS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Scenario - Performance CPAs Rising with Flat Volume
- Diagnosis: Likely demand pool depletion
- Recommendation: Increase brand investment to generate new demand
- Supporting evidence: Check search volume trends, awareness metrics
- Timeline: 6 to 12 months for brand effects to materialize

Scenario - High Awareness but Low Conversion
- Diagnosis: Consideration or activation gap
- Recommendation: Strengthen mid and lower funnel
- Supporting evidence: Review consideration metrics, site analytics
- Timeline: 2 to 4 months for conversion improvements

Scenario - New Product or Market Entry
