CONFIDENCE LEVEL FRAMEWORK v5.0

VERSION: 5.5
DATE: January 2026
STATUS: Production Ready
COMPLIANCE: 6-Rule Compliant
================================================================================
SECTION 1: PURPOSE AND SCOPE
================================================================================

1.1 PURPOSE

This framework defines the methodology for assigning, communicating, and managing confidence levels for all projections and forecasts generated by the Media Planning Agent. Every forecast the agent produces MUST include a confidence level indicator to ensure users understand the reliability and precision of the projection.

The confidence level framework serves the following objectives:

- Establish consistent methodology for projection reliability assessment
- Provide clear communication standards for uncertainty ranges
- Enable users to make informed decisions based on projection accuracy
- Support appropriate expectation setting throughout the planning process
- Facilitate iterative refinement as more data becomes available
- Build trust through transparent acknowledgment of forecast limitations

1.2 SCOPE

This framework applies to all projections generated during:

- PLANNING MODE: All 10 steps of media plan development
- IN-FLIGHT MODE: Performance forecasts and optimization projections
- POST-MORTEM MODE: Comparative analysis and benchmark projections
- All four adaptive pathways: EXPRESS, GUIDED

The framework covers projections for:

- Delivery metrics (impressions, reach, frequency)
- Engagement metrics (clicks, CTR, views, VTR)
- Conversion metrics (conversions, CVR, leads)
- Financial metrics (revenue, ROAS, CAC, CPA)
- Efficiency metrics (NWM, fee percentages)
- Pacing metrics (daily spend, budget utilization)

1.3 CORE PRINCIPLE

The agent MUST always communicate uncertainty honestly. Overstating confidence erodes trust. Understating confidence creates unnecessary concern. The goal is calibrated accuracy where stated confidence ranges match actual outcome distributions over time.

================================================================================
SECTION 2: CONFIDENCE LEVEL DEFINITIONS
================================================================================

2.1 HIGH CONFIDENCE

DEFINITION:
High confidence indicates projections based on reliable, verified data with minimal assumptions. The agent has strong evidence supporting the forecast and expects actual results to fall within a narrow range of the projection.

RANGE: Plus or minus 5-10 percent

NUMERICAL INTERPRETATION:
- If projection is 1,000,000 impressions at HIGH confidence
- Expected range: 900,000 to 1,100,000 impressions (plus or minus 10 percent)
- Tighter range: 950,000 to 1,050,000 impressions (plus or minus 5 percent)

CHARACTERISTICS:
- Based on platform-reported data or verified historical performance
- Calculations use known, stable inputs (contracted CPMs, guaranteed rates)
- Market conditions are stable and predictable
- Minimal dependency on user behavior assumptions
- Short forecast horizon (days to weeks)

WHEN TO ASSIGN HIGH CONFIDENCE:
- Impressions calculated from confirmed CPM and budget
- Reach calculated from platform-provided audience size data
- Frequency calculated from known impression and reach data
- CPM projections based on contracted rates
- Pacing projections early in campaign with stable delivery

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2 MEDIUM CONFIDENCE

DEFINITION:
Medium confidence indicates projections based on reasonable assumptions supported by benchmark data. The agent has good evidence but relies on some assumptions about user behavior or market conditions.

RANGE: Plus or minus 15-20 percent

NUMERICAL INTERPRETATION:
- If projection is 50,000 clicks at MEDIUM confidence
- Expected range: 40,000 to 60,000 clicks (plus or minus 20 percent)
- Tighter range: 42,500 to 57,500 clicks (plus or minus 15 percent)

CHARACTERISTICS:
- Based on industry benchmarks or similar campaign data
- Calculations include assumptions about engagement rates
- Market conditions are relatively stable
- Some dependency on audience behavior patterns
- Medium forecast horizon (weeks to months)

WHEN TO ASSIGN MEDIUM CONFIDENCE:
- Clicks calculated from impressions using benchmark CTR
- CTR projections based on vertical and channel benchmarks
- Video views calculated from impressions using benchmark VTR
- Engagement metrics using historical averages
- CPM projections based on benchmark ranges (not contracted)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.3 MEDIUM-LOW CONFIDENCE

DEFINITION:
Medium-Low confidence indicates projections with significant uncertainty due to multiple assumptions or limited historical data. The agent is providing a reasonable estimate but acknowledges substantial variability is possible.

RANGE: Plus or minus 20-30 percent

NUMERICAL INTERPRETATION:
- If projection is 2,000 conversions at MEDIUM-LOW confidence
- Expected range: 1,400 to 2,600 conversions (plus or minus 30 percent)
- Tighter range: 1,600 to 2,400 conversions (plus or minus 20 percent)

CHARACTERISTICS:
- Based on benchmark data with limited client-specific validation
- Calculations include multiple chained assumptions
- Conversion behavior is inherently variable
- Dependency on landing page, offer, and user intent factors
- Longer forecast horizon or new campaign types

WHEN TO ASSIGN MEDIUM-LOW CONFIDENCE:
- Conversions calculated from clicks using benchmark CVR
- CVR projections for new campaigns without historical data
- Lead generation projections with form completion assumptions
- App install projections without historical data
- Multi-step funnel projections (click to conversion to purchase)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.4 LOW CONFIDENCE

DEFINITION:
Low confidence indicates projections highly dependent on assumptions that may not hold. The agent is providing a directional estimate but actual results could vary significantly from the projection.

RANGE: Plus or minus 25-35 percent

NUMERICAL INTERPRETATION:
- If projection is 500,000 dollars revenue at LOW confidence
- Expected range: 325,000 to 675,000 dollars (plus or minus 35 percent)
- Tighter range: 375,000 to 625,000 dollars (plus or minus 25 percent)

CHARACTERISTICS:
- Based on chained assumptions across multiple conversion steps
- Calculations depend on AOV, LTV, or revenue assumptions
- Significant external factors affect outcomes
- No client-specific historical data available
- Long forecast horizon or highly variable market conditions

WHEN TO ASSIGN LOW CONFIDENCE:
- Revenue projections calculated from conversions times AOV
- ROAS projections without historical revenue data
- LTV projections for new customer acquisition
- CAC projections for new verticals or markets
- Long-term campaign projections (quarters or years)
- Projections for new product launches or market entries

================================================================================
SECTION 5: UPGRADING AND DOWNGRADING RULES
================================================================================

5.1 UPGRADING CONFIDENCE

The agent MUST upgrade confidence when:

RULE 1: Historical Data Becomes Available
- When user provides actual performance data from similar campaigns
- Upgrade by 1 level (e.g., MEDIUM-LOW to MEDIUM)
- Document the data source in the projection

RULE 2: In-Flight Validation
- When early campaign performance validates projection assumptions
- Upgrade by 1 level after 20+ percent of budget spent
- Require 3+ days of consistent performance data

RULE 3: Contracted Rates Confirmed
- When user provides contracted CPM, CPC, or fee rates
- Upgrade related projections by 1 level
- Apply to all calculations using the contracted rate

RULE 4: Platform Estimates Received
- When platform provides audience size or delivery estimates
- Upgrade reach and frequency projections by 1 level
- Note platform source in projection

RULE 5: Reduced Assumption Chain
- When user provides data that eliminates assumptions
- Upgrade by half a level per eliminated assumption
- Maximum upgrade of 1 full level

UPGRADE LIMITS:
- Maximum confidence for any multi-step projection is MEDIUM
- Maximum confidence for revenue projections is MEDIUM without historical data
- Maximum confidence for new campaigns is MEDIUM until in-flight validation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.2 DOWNGRADING CONFIDENCE

The agent MUST downgrade confidence when:

RULE 1: Increased Uncertainty Identified
- When user provides information indicating higher variability
- Downgrade by 1 level
- Examples: new creative, new audience, competitive pressure

RULE 2: Extended Time Horizon
- When projection extends beyond original timeline
- Downgrade by half a level per additional month
- Maximum downgrade of 1 full level

- Maximum downgrade of 1 full level

RULE 6: Conflicting Data Sources
- When sources provide conflicting benchmarks
- Downgrade by 1 level
- Present range from conflicting sources

DOWNGRADE FLOOR:
- Minimum confidence level is LOW
- If conditions warrant lower than LOW, state projection is "highly speculative"
- Recommend not making decisions based on highly speculative projections

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.3 CONFIDENCE PROPAGATION

When projections are chained, confidence propagates as follows:

RULE: Use Lowest Input Confidence
- Final projection confidence equals the lowest input confidence
- Exception: If all inputs are HIGH, final can be MEDIUM (not HIGH)

EXAMPLES:

Example 1: Clicks Calculation
- Impressions: HIGH confidence
- CTR: MEDIUM confidence
- Clicks projection: MEDIUM confidence (lowest input)

Example 2: Conversions Calculation
- Clicks: MEDIUM confidence
- CVR: MEDIUM-LOW confidence
- Conversions projection: MEDIUM-LOW confidence (lowest input)

Example 3: Revenue Calculation
- Conversions: MEDIUM-LOW confidence
- AOV: MEDIUM confidence
- Revenue projection: MEDIUM-LOW confidence (lowest input)

Example 4: CAC Calculation
- Budget: HIGH confidence (known)
- Conversions: MEDIUM-LOW confidence
- CAC projection: MEDIUM-LOW confidence (lowest input)

================================================================================
SECTION 6: MARGIN OF ERROR CALCULATIONS
================================================================================

6.1 SINGLE PROJECTION MARGIN

For a single projection, calculate the margin of error range:

HIGH CONFIDENCE CALCULATION:
- Projection: X
- Low estimate: X multiplied by 0.90 (minus 10 percent)
- High estimate: X multiplied by 1.10 (plus 10 percent)
- Range: Low estimate to High estimate

MEDIUM CONFIDENCE CALCULATION:
- Projection: X
- Low estimate: X multiplied by 0.80 (minus 20 percent)
- High estimate: X multiplied by 1.20 (plus 20 percent)
- Range: Low estimate to High estimate

MEDIUM-LOW CONFIDENCE CALCULATION:
- Projection: X
- Low estimate: X multiplied by 0.70 (minus 30 percent)
- High estimate: X multiplied by 1.30 (plus 30 percent)
- Range: Low estimate to High estimate

LOW CONFIDENCE CALCULATION:
- Projection: X
- Low estimate: X multiplied by 0.65 (minus 35 percent)
- High estimate: X multiplied by 1.35 (plus 35 percent)
- Range: Low estimate to High estimate

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.2 CHAINED PROJECTION MARGIN

When projections are chained, margins compound:

COMPOUND MARGIN CALCULATION:
- Do not simply add margin percentages
- Calculate range at each step and propagate
- Final range is product of individual ranges

EXAMPLE: Revenue from Impressions

Step 1: Impressions (HIGH, plus or minus 10 percent)
- Projection: 10,000,000
- Range: 9,000,000 to 11,000,000

Step 2: Clicks (MEDIUM, plus or minus 20 percent from Step 1)
- CTR assumption: 0.8 percent
- Projection: 80,000 clicks
- Range from impression variance: 72,000 to 88,000
- Additional CTR variance: 57,600 to 105,600

Step 3: Conversions (MEDIUM-LOW, plus or minus 30 percent from Step 2)
- CVR assumption: 2.5 percent
- Projection: 2,000 conversions
- Range compounds further: 1,008 to 3,432

Step 4: Revenue (LOW, plus or minus 35 percent from Step 3)
- AOV assumption: 100 dollars
- Projection: 200,000 dollars
- Final range: 65,520 to 463,320 dollars

NOTE: The compounding effect demonstrates why downstream projections have lower confidence levels.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.3 PRESENTING MARGIN OF ERROR

The agent MUST present margin of error in user-friendly terms:

FORMAT 1: Range Statement
"Projecting 2,000 conversions (MEDIUM-LOW confidence, range 1,400-2,600)"

FORMAT 2: Plus/Minus Statement
"Projecting 2,000 conversions (MEDIUM-LOW confidence, plus or minus 30 percent)"

FORMAT 3: Confidence Band Statement
"Projecting 2,000 conversions at MEDIUM-LOW confidence. Expect actual results between 1,400 and 2,600."

FORMAT 4: Probability Statement (Advanced)
"Projecting 2,000 conversions. There is approximately 80 percent probability actual results will fall between 1,400 and 2,600."

================================================================================
SECTION 7: COMMUNICATION TEMPLATES
================================================================================

7.1 HIGH CONFIDENCE TEMPLATES

TEMPLATE H1: Simple Statement
"Projecting [X] [metric] (HIGH confidence, plus or minus 5-10 percent)."

EXAMPLE:
"Projecting 5.2 million impressions (HIGH confidence, plus or minus 5-10 percent)."

TEMPLATE H2: With Range
"Projecting [X] [metric] at HIGH confidence. Expect actual delivery between [low] and [high]."

EXAMPLE:
"Projecting 5.2 million impressions at HIGH confidence. Expect actual delivery between 4.7 million and 5.7 million."

TEMPLATE H3: With Rationale
"Projecting [X] [metric] at HIGH confidence based on [rationale]. This uses [data source] which is [reliability statement]."

EXAMPLE:
"Projecting 5.2 million impressions at HIGH confidence based on your contracted CPM of 14.50 dollars. This uses confirmed rate card pricing which is highly reliable."

TEMPLATE H4: In Context
"Based on your [budget] at [CPM], I'm projecting [X] [metric] with HIGH confidence. The [data source] gives us strong certainty here."

EXAMPLE:
"Based on your 75,000 dollar budget at a contracted CPM of 14.50 dollars, I'm projecting 5.2 million impressions with HIGH confidence. The confirmed rate card gives us strong certainty here."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.2 MEDIUM CONFIDENCE TEMPLATES

TEMPLATE M1: Simple Statement
"Projecting [X] [metric] (MEDIUM confidence, plus or minus 15-20 percent)."

EXAMPLE:
"Projecting 41,600 clicks (MEDIUM confidence, plus or minus 15-20 percent)."

TEMPLATE M2: With Range
"Estimating [X] [metric] at MEDIUM confidence. Actual results likely between [low] and [high]."

EXAMPLE:
"Estimating 41,600 clicks at MEDIUM confidence. Actual results likely between 33,300 and 50,000."

TEMPLATE M3: With Rationale
"Projecting [X] [metric] at MEDIUM confidence. This uses [benchmark source] for [assumption], which is reasonable but not guaranteed."

EXAMPLE:
"Projecting 41,600 clicks at MEDIUM confidence. This uses industry benchmark CTR of 0.8 percent for retail display, which is reasonable but not guaranteed for your specific creative and audience."

TEMPLATE M4: With Upgrade Path
"Estimating [X] [metric] at MEDIUM confidence based on benchmarks. Confidence would increase to HIGH if you can provide historical CTR data from similar campaigns."

EXAMPLE:
"Estimating 41,600 clicks at MEDIUM confidence based on benchmarks. Confidence would increase to HIGH if you can provide historical CTR data from similar campaigns."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.3 MEDIUM-LOW CONFIDENCE TEMPLATES

TEMPLATE ML1: Simple Statement
"Projecting [X] [metric] (MEDIUM-LOW confidence, plus or minus 20-30 percent)."

EXAMPLE:
"Projecting 1,040 conversions (MEDIUM-LOW confidence, plus or minus 20-30 percent)."

TEMPLATE ML2: With Range
"Estimating [X] [metric] at MEDIUM-LOW confidence. Actual results could range from [low] to [high] depending on [key variable]."

EXAMPLE:
"Estimating 1,040 conversions at MEDIUM-LOW confidence. Actual results could range from 728 to 1,352 depending on landing page performance and offer appeal."

TEMPLATE ML3: With Caution
"Projecting [X] [metric] at MEDIUM-LOW confidence. This projection relies on [assumption] which has significant variability. Plan for a range of [low] to [high]."

EXAMPLE:
"Projecting 1,040 conversions at MEDIUM-LOW confidence. This projection relies on a 2.5 percent CVR benchmark which has significant variability. Plan for a range of 728 to 1,352 conversions."

TEMPLATE ML4: With Recommendation
"Estimating [X] [metric] at MEDIUM-LOW confidence due to [reason]. I recommend [action] to improve projection accuracy."

EXAMPLE:
"Estimating 1,040 conversions at MEDIUM-LOW confidence due to lack of historical conversion data. I recommend running a 2-week test flight to establish actual CVR before committing full budget."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.4 LOW CONFIDENCE TEMPLATES

TEMPLATE L1: Simple Statement
"Projecting [X] [metric] (LOW confidence, plus or minus 25-35 percent). Treat as directional estimate only."

EXAMPLE:
"Projecting 104,000 dollars revenue (LOW confidence, plus or minus 25-35 percent). Treat as directional estimate only."

TEMPLATE L2: With Wide Range
"Estimating [X] [metric] at LOW confidence. Actual results could realistically range from [low] to [high]. This is a planning estimate, not a commitment."

EXAMPLE:
"Estimating 104,000 dollars revenue at LOW confidence. Actual results could realistically range from 68,000 to 140,000 dollars. This is a planning estimate, not a commitment."

TEMPLATE L3: With Explicit Uncertainty
"Projecting [X] [metric] at LOW confidence. This relies on multiple assumptions: [list]. Any of these could vary significantly, so treat this as directional guidance only."

EXAMPLE:
"Projecting 104,000 dollars revenue at LOW confidence. This relies on multiple assumptions: benchmark CTR (0.8 percent), benchmark CVR (2.5 percent), and estimated AOV (100 dollars). Any of these could vary significantly, so treat this as directional guidance only."

TEMPLATE L4: With Alternative Approach
"Estimating [X] [metric] at LOW confidence due to [reason]. For more accurate projections, consider [alternative]. For now, I recommend planning for a range of [low] to [high]."

EXAMPLE:
"Estimating 104,000 dollars revenue at LOW confidence due to no historical conversion or AOV data. For more accurate projections, consider a phased approach with learning budget. For now, I recommend planning for a range of 68,000 to 140,000 dollars."

================================================================================
SECTION 8: COMPLETE EXAMPLE SCENARIOS
================================================================================

8.1 SCENARIO 1: NEW E-COMMERCE CAMPAIGN

CONTEXT: A new DTC fashion brand planning their first paid media campaign. No historical data available. Budget is 150,000 dollars over 60 days.

CONVERSATION:

USER: We're launching our first campaign. Budget is 150K over 60 days. We want to acquire new customers.

AGENT: Got it - 150,000 dollars over 60 days for customer acquisition. That's 2,500 dollars daily spend. Let me build out projections for you.

What's your primary product price point? This helps me estimate average order value for revenue projections.

USER: Our average order is around 85 dollars.

AGENT: Thanks - 85 dollar AOV noted. For fashion DTC, I'm using these benchmarks:
- Meta CPM: 12-16 dollars (using 14 dollars midpoint)
- CTR: 0.8-1.2 percent (using 1.0 percent)
- CVR: 2.0-3.0 percent (using 2.5 percent)

Here are your projections:

IMPRESSIONS: 10.7 million
- Calculation: 150,000 dollars divided by 14 dollar CPM times 1,000
- Confidence: HIGH (plus or minus 10 percent)
- Range: 9.6 million to 11.8 million
- Rationale: Budget is known, CPM is stable for this channel

CLICKS: 107,000
- Calculation: 10.7 million impressions times 1.0 percent CTR
- Confidence: MEDIUM (plus or minus 20 percent)
- Range: 86,000 to 128,000
- Rationale: Using benchmark CTR, no historical data yet

CONVERSIONS: 2,675
- Calculation: 107,000 clicks times 2.5 percent CVR
- Confidence: MEDIUM-LOW (plus or minus 30 percent)
- Range: 1,873 to 3,478
- Rationale: CVR depends on landing page and offer effectiveness

REVENUE: 227,375 dollars
- Calculation: 2,675 conversions times 85 dollar AOV
- Confidence: LOW (plus or minus 35 percent)
- Range: 148,000 to 307,000 dollars
- Rationale: Multiple assumptions compound uncertainty

CAC: 56 dollars
- Calculation: 150,000 dollars divided by 2,675 conversions
- Confidence: MEDIUM-LOW (plus or minus 30 percent)
- Range: 43 to 80 dollars
- Rationale: Follows conversion confidence level

ROAS: 1.52x
- Calculation: 227,375 dollars divided by 150,000 dollars
- Confidence: LOW (plus or minus 35 percent)
- Range: 0.99x to 2.05x
- Rationale: Follows revenue confidence level

USER: That ROAS range is huge. How do we narrow it?

AGENT: You're right - the 0.99x to 2.05x range is wide. Here's what would increase confidence:

- Run a 2-week test flight (20K budget)
   - Establishes actual CTR and CVR
   - Could upgrade conversion confidence to MEDIUM

- Provide any prior performance data
   - Even from other channels helps calibrate
   - Historical email CVR, for example

- Use platform audience estimates
   - Meta's estimated reach tightens impression projections
   - Request this during campaign setup

For now, I recommend planning scenarios at pessimistic (0.99x), expected (1.52x), and optimistic (2.05x) ROAS. What's the minimum ROAS you need for this to be viable?

USER: We need at least 1.2x ROAS to break even after COGS.

AGENT: Good to know - 1.2x ROAS is your floor. Let me recalculate with that constraint.

At 1.2x ROAS:
- Required revenue: 180,000 dollars (150K times 1.2)
- Required conversions: 2,118 (180K divided by 85 dollar AOV)
- Required CVR: 1.98 percent (2,118 divided by 107K clicks)

The good news: 1.98 percent CVR is within benchmark range (2.0-3.0 percent). You have buffer room.

However, at MEDIUM-LOW confidence, there's meaningful risk of underperformance. My recommendation:

Phase 1: Test flight (20K budget, 2 weeks)
- Validate actual CTR and CVR
- Establish CAC baseline
- Upgrade confidence before committing full budget

Phase 2: Scale (130K remaining, 46 days)
- Apply learnings from test
- Adjust projections with actual data
- Monitor against 1.2x ROAS floor

This approach reduces risk of spending full budget before understanding actual performance. Shall I build the phased plan?

USER: Yes, let's do the phased approach.

AGENT: Perfect. Here's the phased plan with updated confidence levels:

PHASE 1: TEST FLIGHT
- Budget: 20,000 dollars
- Duration: 14 days
- Daily spend: 1,429 dollars

Projections (unchanged confidence):
- Impressions: 1.43 million (HIGH)
- Clicks: 14,300 (MEDIUM)
- Conversions: 358 (MEDIUM-LOW)
- Revenue: 30,400 dollars (LOW)

Success criteria for Phase 2:
- CTR at or above 0.8 percent
- CVR at or above 2.0 percent
- CAC at or below 70 dollars

PHASE 2: SCALE (if Phase 1 succeeds)
- Budget: 130,000 dollars
- Duration: 46 days
- Daily spend: 2,826 dollars

Projections (upgraded confidence after Phase 1):
- Impressions: 9.3 million (HIGH - unchanged)
- Clicks: 92,700 (MEDIUM to HIGH - validated CTR)
- Conversions: 2,318 (MEDIUM - validated CVR upgrades from MEDIUM-LOW)
- Revenue: 197,000 dollars (MEDIUM - upgraded from LOW)

The phased approach upgrades your revenue confidence from LOW to MEDIUM by eliminating assumptions with real data.

Foundation phase complete. Foundation phase. Ready for Gate 1 validation?

8.2 SCENARIO 2: B2B SAAS WITH HISTORICAL DATA

CONTEXT: An established B2B SaaS company with 18 months of advertising data. They have historical CPMs, CTRs, and conversion rates. Budget is 300,000 dollars quarterly.

CONVERSATION:

USER: We're planning Q1. 300K budget across LinkedIn and Google Search. We have lots of historical data.

AGENT: Great - 300K quarterly with historical data gives us strong foundation. Let me pull your channel-specific projections.

Before I calculate, can you share your historical performance? Specifically:
- LinkedIn: average CPM and CTR
- Google Search: average CPC and CVR
- Overall: typical CAC and demo-to-close rate

USER: LinkedIn CPM runs 38-42 dollars, CTR around 0.45 percent. Google CPC is 4.50-5.50 dollars, CVR from click to demo request is 3.2 percent. Our CAC has been 380-420 dollars. Demo-to-close is about 22 percent.

AGENT: Excellent data. This significantly upgrades our confidence levels. Let me recalculate with your actuals.

Assuming 60/40 split (180K LinkedIn, 120K Google Search):

LINKEDIN PROJECTIONS:

Impressions: 4.5 million
- Calculation: 180,000 dollars divided by 40 dollar CPM times 1,000
- Confidence: HIGH (plus or minus 5-10 percent)
- Range: 4.1 million to 4.9 million
- Rationale: Using your historical CPM range midpoint

Clicks: 20,250
- Calculation: 4.5 million times 0.45 percent CTR
- Confidence: HIGH (plus or minus 10 percent)
- Range: 18,200 to 22,300
- Rationale: Your historical CTR is consistent at 0.45 percent

Demo Requests from LinkedIn: 648
- Calculation: 20,250 clicks times 3.2 percent CVR
- Confidence: MEDIUM (plus or minus 15 percent)
- Range: 551 to 745
- Rationale: CVR validated but applying to different channel

GOOGLE SEARCH PROJECTIONS:

Clicks: 24,000
- Calculation: 120,000 dollars divided by 5 dollar CPC
- Confidence: HIGH (plus or minus 10 percent)
- Range: 21,600 to 26,400
- Rationale: Using your historical CPC range midpoint

Demo Requests from Search: 768
- Calculation: 24,000 clicks times 3.2 percent CVR
- Confidence: HIGH (plus or minus 10 percent)
- Range: 691 to 845
- Rationale: Your historical CVR is consistent

COMBINED PROJECTIONS:

Total Demo Requests: 1,416
- Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH (plus or minus 12 percent)
- Range: 1,246 to 1,586
- Rationale: Blended from HIGH and MEDIUM sources

Closed Deals: 311
- Calculation: 1,416 demos times 22 percent close rate
- Confidence: MEDIUM (plus or minus 15 percent)
- Range: 264 to 358
- Rationale: Close rate is sales-dependent, introducing variability

CAC: 965 dollars per deal
- Calculation: 300,000 dollars divided by 311 deals
- Confidence: MEDIUM (plus or minus 15 percent)
- Range: 838 to 1,136 dollars
- Rationale: Follows deal confidence

Wait - that CAC is well above your historical 380-420 dollars. Let me check the math.

USER: Our CAC is per demo request, not per closed deal.

AGENT: Ah, that makes more sense. Let me recalculate:

CAC (per demo): 212 dollars
- Calculation: 300,000 dollars divided by 1,416 demos
- Confidence: MEDIUM (plus or minus 15 percent)
- Range: 189 to 241 dollars
- Rationale: Demo volume is the blended confidence level

That's well below your historical 380-420 dollars range. Either:
- Your historical data includes sales costs (fully loaded CAC)
- Efficiency has improved
- I should validate my assumptions

Which CAC definition have you been using?

USER: Our CAC of 380-420 is marketing-only cost per demo. Your projection seems too optimistic.

AGENT: Good catch. Let me reconcile. If your actual CAC is 380-420 dollars per demo with similar spend:

Historical implied demos: 300K divided by 400 dollars = 750 demos

My projection: 1,416 demos

That's nearly 2x difference. Possible explanations:

- CPM and CPC have increased (your ranges might be outdated)
- CTR or CVR has declined
- My channel split assumption differs from historical

Can you share your typical channel split? And are those CPM/CPC figures from last quarter specifically?

USER: Those metrics are from Q3. Q4 was rougher - CPMs jumped to 55 dollars on LinkedIn during election season. Channel split is usually 50/50.

AGENT: That explains it. Let me recalculate with:
- 50/50 split (150K each channel)
- LinkedIn CPM: 45-50 dollars (adjusting for Q1, post-election but still elevated)
- Same CTR and CVR assumptions

REVISED LINKEDIN PROJECTIONS:

Impressions: 3.2 million
- Calculation: 150,000 dollars divided by 47 dollar CPM times 1,000
- Confidence: MEDIUM (plus or minus 15 percent)
- Range: 2.7 million to 3.7 million
- Rationale: CPM elevated and uncertain post-election

Clicks: 14,400
- Calculation: 3.2 million times 0.45 percent CTR
- Confidence: MEDIUM (plus or minus 15 percent)
- Range: 12,200 to 16,600
- Rationale: Impression uncertainty propagates

Demo Requests from LinkedIn: 461
- Calculation: 14,400 clicks times 3.2 percent CVR
- Confidence: MEDIUM (plus or minus 20 percent)
- Range: 369 to 553
- Rationale: Compounded uncertainty

REVISED GOOGLE SEARCH PROJECTIONS:

Clicks: 30,000
- Calculation: 150,000 dollars divided by 5 dollar CPC
- Confidence: HIGH (plus or minus 10 percent)
- Range: 27,000 to 33,000
- Rationale: Your CPC data is more stable

Demo Requests from Search: 960
- Calculation: 30,000 clicks times 3.2 percent CVR
- Confidence: HIGH (plus or minus 10 percent)
- Range: 864 to 1,056
- Rationale: Strong historical validation

REVISED COMBINED PROJECTIONS:

Total Demo Requests: 1,421
- Confidence: MEDIUM (plus or minus 15 percent)
- Range: 1,208 to 1,634
- Wait, that's still similar. Let me check Google share.

Actually, with 50/50 split and Google performing better per dollar, Google drives most demos. The issue may be LinkedIn CTR declining or something else.

What was your Q3 vs Q4 demo volume difference?

USER: Q3 we got 780 demos. Q4 dropped to 520.

AGENT: That's the calibration data I needed.

Q3: 780 demos at approximately 300K = 385 dollars CAC (matches your range)
Q4: 520 demos at approximately 300K = 577 dollars CAC (above range)

The Q4 decline aligns with elevated CPMs. For Q1 planning:

CONSERVATIVE PROJECTION (likely):
- Demos: 650-700 (between Q3 and Q4)
- CAC: 430-460 dollars
- Confidence: MEDIUM (plus or minus 15 percent)

This assumes:
- CPMs moderate from Q4 peak but stay above Q3
- CTR and CVR remain stable
- 50/50 channel split maintained

OPTIMISTIC PROJECTION (if CPMs normalize):
- Demos: 750-800 (back to Q3 levels)
- CAC: 375-400 dollars
- Confidence: MEDIUM-LOW (plus or minus 20 percent)

My recommendation: Plan for conservative scenario (650-700 demos, 450 dollar CAC) and treat any improvement as upside.

Confidence is MEDIUM because we're extrapolating from recent trends with uncertainty about CPM normalization.

Does this align with your expectations?

USER: Yes, that's more realistic. Let's plan for 680 demos at 440 CAC.

AGENT: Perfect. Final projections locked:

Q1 MEDIA PLAN PROJECTIONS:

Budget: 300,000 dollars
Duration: 90 days (Q1)

Demo Requests: 680
- Confidence: MEDIUM (plus or minus 15 percent)
- Range: 578 to 782
- Calibration: Based on Q3/Q4 historical performance

CAC: 441 dollars
- Confidence: MEDIUM (plus or minus 15 percent)
- Range: 384 to 519 dollars
- Validation: Within historical range (380-420) plus CPM inflation

Closed Deals: 150
- Calculation: 680 demos times 22 percent close rate
- Confidence: MEDIUM (plus or minus 20 percent)
- Range: 120 to 180
- Note: Sales conversion adds variability

The MEDIUM confidence level reflects:
- Strong historical data foundation (upgrades from MEDIUM-LOW)
- Uncertainty about Q1 CPM environment (prevents HIGH)
- Validated conversion rates (supports MEDIUM floor)

Foundation phase complete. Shall we proceed to audience definition?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.3 SCENARIO 3: IN-FLIGHT CONFIDENCE UPGRADE

CONTEXT: A campaign that started with MEDIUM-LOW confidence projections. After 3 weeks of performance data, confidence can be upgraded.

CONVERSATION:

USER: We're 3 weeks into the campaign. Can you update our projections?

AGENT: Absolutely. You're on Day 21 of 60. Let me pull current performance and recalculate.

Can you share:
- Spend to date
- Impressions delivered
- Clicks
- Conversions
- Any revenue data

USER: Spent 52,000 of 150,000. 3.8 million impressions. 34,200 clicks. 892 conversions. Revenue is 78,500 dollars.

AGENT: Great data. Let me calculate actuals and upgrade projections.

ACTUAL PERFORMANCE (Days 1-21):

Spend: 52,000 dollars (34.7 percent of budget)
Time elapsed: 35 percent (21 of 60 days)
Pacing: 0.99 (essentially on track)

CPM: 13.68 dollars
- Calculation: 52,000 divided by 3,800 times 1,000
- Variance from plan: Minus 2.3 percent (planned 14 dollars)
- Status: Better than expected

CTR: 0.90 percent
- Calculation: 34,200 divided by 3,800,000
- Variance from plan: Minus 10 percent (planned 1.0 percent)
- Status: Slightly below but acceptable

CVR: 2.61 percent
- Calculation: 892 divided by 34,200
- Variance from plan: Plus 4.4 percent (planned 2.5 percent)
- Status: Beating expectations

AOV: 88 dollars
- Calculation: 78,500 divided by 892
- Variance from plan: Plus 3.5 percent (planned 85 dollars)
- Status: Higher than expected

CONFIDENCE UPGRADES:

Original CTR confidence: MEDIUM (benchmark-based)
New CTR confidence: HIGH (validated with 3+ weeks data)
Rationale: 34,200 clicks provides statistical significance

Original CVR confidence: MEDIUM-LOW (benchmark-based)
New CVR confidence: MEDIUM (validated, exceeding benchmark)
Rationale: 892 conversions validates conversion funnel

Original Revenue confidence: LOW (multiple assumptions)
New Revenue confidence: MEDIUM (validated AOV and CVR)
Rationale: Actual data replaces assumptions

UPDATED PROJECTIONS (Days 22-60):

Remaining budget: 98,000 dollars
Remaining days: 39

Impressions remaining: 7.2 million
- Calculation: 98,000 divided by 13.68 CPM times 1,000
- Confidence: HIGH (using actual CPM)
- Range: 6.5 million to 7.9 million

Clicks remaining: 64,800
- Calculation: 7.2 million times 0.90 percent actual CTR
- Confidence: HIGH (upgraded from MEDIUM)
- Range: 58,300 to 71,300

Conversions remaining: 1,691
- Calculation: 64,800 times 2.61 percent actual CVR
- Confidence: MEDIUM (upgraded from MEDIUM-LOW)
- Range: 1,437 to 1,945

Revenue remaining: 148,800 dollars
- Calculation: 1,691 times 88 dollar actual AOV
- Confidence: MEDIUM (upgraded from LOW)
- Range: 126,500 to 171,200

TOTAL CAMPAIGN PROJECTIONS:

Total impressions: 11.0 million (HIGH confidence)
Total clicks: 99,000 (HIGH confidence)
Total conversions: 2,583 (MEDIUM confidence)
Total revenue: 227,300 dollars (MEDIUM confidence)

CAC: 58 dollars (MEDIUM confidence)
ROAS: 1.52x (MEDIUM confidence)

COMPARISON TO ORIGINAL PROJECTIONS:

Original conversions: 2,675 (MEDIUM-LOW) - Range: 1,873 to 3,478
Updated conversions: 2,583 (MEDIUM) - Range: 2,196 to 2,970

Original revenue: 227,375 dollars (LOW) - Range: 148K to 307K
Updated revenue: 227,300 dollars (MEDIUM) - Range: 193K to 262K

KEY INSIGHT: Revenue projection is nearly identical, but confidence has upgraded from LOW to MEDIUM. Your planning range narrows from 159K spread to 69K spread. Much more predictable outcome now.

USER: The tighter range is helpful. What would get us to HIGH confidence on revenue?

AGENT: To achieve HIGH confidence on revenue, you would need:

- More conversion data (current: 892)
   - Typically need 1,500+ conversions for HIGH confidence
   - You'll reach this around Day 35

- Stable CVR trend
   - Current CVR: 2.61 percent
   - Need 3+ weeks at consistent rate
   - You're on track

- AOV consistency
   - Current: 88 dollars (higher than expected)
   - Need to verify this holds
   - Watch for promotional impact

- No major market changes
   - Stable competitive environment
   - No platform algorithm changes
   - Consistent inventory quality

My projection: You could reach HIGH confidence for revenue around Week 5 (Day 35) if trends hold.

At that point, I would upgrade:
- Revenue confidence: HIGH (plus or minus 10 percent)
- Range would narrow to: 205K to 250K
- Much tighter planning window

Shall I set a reminder to re-run projections at Day 35?

USER: Yes, please. Also, should we increase budget given the strong performance?

AGENT: Good instinct. Let me model a budget increase scenario.

CURRENT TRAJECTORY:
- ROAS: 1.52x (above your 1.2x minimum)
- CAC: 58 dollars (well below 80 dollar ceiling from original range)
- CVR: 2.61 percent (above 2.5 percent benchmark)

BUDGET INCREASE ANALYSIS:

If you add 50K (total 200K):
- Additional conversions: 563 (MEDIUM confidence)
- Additional revenue: 49,500 dollars
- Incremental ROAS: 0.99x (lower than average due to marginal efficiency)
- Wait - that's below your floor.

Let me recalculate. Marginal performance often differs from average:
- First 150K may have captured highest-intent audiences
- Additional 50K may face higher CPM and lower CVR
- Typical efficiency decay: 10-20 percent

REVISED BUDGET INCREASE PROJECTION:

Additional 50K budget:
- Impressions: 3.3 million (at 15 dollar CPM, higher than current)
- Clicks: 26,400 (at 0.80 percent CTR, lower than current)
- Conversions: 528 (at 2.0 percent CVR, lower than current)
- Revenue: 44,900 dollars (at 85 dollar AOV, lower than current)
- Incremental ROAS: 0.90x

Confidence: MEDIUM-LOW (projecting marginal performance)

RECOMMENDATION: The marginal ROAS (0.90x) is below your 1.2x floor. I would NOT recommend adding budget mid-flight.

Better approach:
- Complete current campaign
- Analyze which audiences/placements drove best performance
- Plan next flight with those learnings
- Could then justify 200K with improved targeting

Does this analysis help with the budget decision?

USER: That's really helpful. Let's stick with current budget.

AGENT: Smart decision. I'll note that in the session.

SUMMARY - Day 21 Check-In:

Performance: On track, beating conversion expectations
Confidence upgrades: CTR to HIGH, CVR to MEDIUM, Revenue to MEDIUM
Projection: 2,583 conversions, 227,300 dollars revenue (both MEDIUM confidence)
Budget recommendation: Maintain current 150K (no increase)
Next check-in: Day 35 for potential HIGH confidence upgrade

Execution phase. In-Flight Mode. Campaign healthy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.4 SCENARIO 4: LOW CONFIDENCE WITH MITIGATION STRATEGIES

CONTEXT: A campaign entering a new market with no historical data. All projections start at LOW confidence. Agent demonstrates how to communicate and improve.

CONVERSATION:

USER: We're launching in Mexico for the first time. 80K budget, 45 day campaign. We have zero data for this market.

AGENT: Understood - first campaign in Mexico with 80K over 45 days. This is a market entry scenario where projections will necessarily have lower confidence. Let me set appropriate expectations.

IMPORTANT: All projections for this campaign will be LOW to MEDIUM-LOW confidence due to:
- No historical performance in Mexico
- Different consumer behavior patterns
- Unknown competitive landscape
- Currency and pricing differences
- Platform performance may vary by market

I'll provide projections with wider ranges and recommend mitigation strategies.

What's your vertical and primary objective?

USER: We're a fintech app. Objective is app installs that convert to account signups.

AGENT: Fintech app installs in Mexico. Let me apply LATAM market benchmarks with appropriate uncertainty.

MARKET CONTEXT (from research):
- Mexico digital ad spend: Growing 15 percent annually
- Mobile-first market: 70+ percent mobile usage
- Fintech adoption: Accelerating post-COVID
- Meta and Google dominate digital spend

BENCHMARK RANGES (with high uncertainty):
- Meta CPM: 3-6 dollars (lower than US, but variable)
- App install CPI: 1.50-3.50 dollars (wide range for fintech)
- Install to signup: 25-45 percent (depends on onboarding flow)

PROJECTIONS:

Impressions: 16-27 million
- Calculation: 80K budget at 3-5 dollar CPM range
- Confidence: MEDIUM-LOW (plus or minus 25 percent)
- Rationale: CPM benchmark range is wide for Mexico

App Installs: 23,000-53,000
- Calculation: 80K budget divided by CPI range
- Confidence: LOW (plus or minus 35 percent)
- Range intentionally wide: Could be as low as 15K or as high as 60K
- Rationale: CPI highly variable for new market entry

Account Signups: 8,000-19,000
- Calculation: Installs times signup rate range
- Confidence: LOW (plus or minus 35 percent)
- Range intentionally wide: Could be 5K to 25K
- Rationale: Onboarding conversion unknown in Mexico

Cost Per Signup: 4.20-10.00 dollars
- Calculation: 80K divided by signup range
- Confidence: LOW (plus or minus 35 percent)
- Rationale: Follows signup projection confidence

USER: Those ranges are really wide. 15K to 60K installs is not very useful for planning.

AGENT: You're right - that range is too wide for operational planning. Let me offer three specific scenarios instead.

SCENARIO A: PESSIMISTIC
- Assumes: Premium CPM (5 dollars), high CPI (3.50 dollars), low signup rate (25 percent)
- Installs: 22,857
- Signups: 5,714
- Cost per signup: 14 dollars
- Use this for: Budget justification, downside planning

SCENARIO B: EXPECTED (Midpoint)
- Assumes: Mid CPM (4 dollars), mid CPI (2.50 dollars), mid signup rate (35 percent)
- Installs: 32,000
- Signups: 11,200
- Cost per signup: 7.14 dollars
- Use this for: Target setting, team goals

SCENARIO C: OPTIMISTIC
- Assumes: Low CPM (3 dollars), low CPI (1.50 dollars), high signup rate (45 percent)
- Installs: 53,333
- Signups: 24,000
- Cost per signup: 3.33 dollars
- Use this for: Upside planning, scale potential

All scenarios are LOW confidence (plus or minus 35 percent).

RECOMMENDATION: Plan operationally for Scenario B (11,200 signups at 7.14 dollars), but communicate Scenario A (5,714 signups) as the floor for stakeholder expectations.

USER: What can we do to improve confidence faster?

AGENT: Excellent question. Here are strategies to upgrade confidence from LOW to MEDIUM or MEDIUM-HIGH within the campaign:

STRATEGY 1: PHASED LAUNCH
- Phase 1: 20K budget over 10 days (test flight)
- Phase 2: 60K budget over 35 days (scale if Phase 1 succeeds)

Benefits:
- Establishes actual CPI within 10 days
- Validates signup rate with real data
- Upgrades confidence to MEDIUM before committing 75 percent of budget

Phase 1 success criteria:
- CPI below 3.50 dollars
- Signup rate above 30 percent
- No fraud indicators above 5 percent

STRATEGY 2: MULTI-CHANNEL TEST
- Split budget across Meta (60 percent) and Google (40 percent)
- Compare CPI and signup rates by channel
- Double down on winner in Week 2

Benefits:
- Reduces platform-specific risk
- Provides comparison data for optimization
- May find significantly different performance by channel

STRATEGY 3: MEXICO-SPECIFIC CREATIVE TEST
- Launch with 3-4 creative variants localized for Mexico
- Measure CTR and CVR by creative
- Cut underperformers within 5 days

Benefits:
- Localized creative often lifts CVR 20-40 percent
- Reduces CPI through better engagement
- Shows cultural resonance quickly

STRATEGY 4: DAILY MONITORING PROTOCOL
- Day 1-3: Monitor for delivery and fraud
- Day 4-7: Analyze CPI trends and signup rates
- Day 8-10: Make go/no-go decision for scale
- Day 11+: Weekly optimization reviews

Benefits:
- Catches problems early
- Enables rapid course correction
- Builds confidence through accumulated data

MY RECOMMENDATION: Implement Strategy 1 (Phased Launch) combined with Strategy 4 (Daily Monitoring).

With this approach:
- Day 10: Upgrade from LOW to MEDIUM-LOW confidence
- Day 21: Potential upgrade to MEDIUM confidence
- Day 35: Potential upgrade to MEDIUM-HIGH confidence

Would you like me to build the phased plan with specific checkpoints?

USER: Yes, build the phased plan.

AGENT: Here's your Mexico market entry plan with confidence upgrade milestones:

PHASE 1: TEST FLIGHT (Days 1-10)
Budget: 20,000 dollars
Daily spend: 2,000 dollars

Projections (LOW confidence, plus or minus 35 percent):
- Impressions: 4-6.7 million
- Installs: 5,700-13,300
- Signups: 2,000-4,700
- Expected midpoint: 8,000 installs, 2,800 signups

CHECKPOINT DAY 5:
Review: CPI trend, signup rate, fraud rate
Decision: Continue, adjust, or pause
Confidence status: Still LOW

CHECKPOINT DAY 10:
Review: Total installs, signups, cost per signup
Decision: Proceed to Phase 2 or pivot
Expected confidence: MEDIUM-LOW (upgraded from LOW)

Phase 1 success criteria:
- CPI at or below 3.00 dollars
- Signup rate at or above 30 percent
- Fraud rate below 5 percent
- No platform policy issues

If Phase 1 fails criteria:
- Option A: Adjust targeting and extend Phase 1 (add 10K budget)
- Option B: Pivot to different channel or creative approach
- Option C: Pause and reassess market fit

PHASE 2: SCALE (Days 11-45, if Phase 1 succeeds)
Budget: 60,000 dollars
Daily spend: 1,714 dollars

Projections (using Phase 1 actuals, MEDIUM-LOW confidence):
- Will recalculate based on actual CPI and signup rate
- Expected range will narrow by 30-40 percent
- Confidence upgrades as data accumulates

CHECKPOINT DAY 21:
Review: 3-week performance, trend analysis
Expected confidence: MEDIUM
Action: Optimize based on data

CHECKPOINT DAY 35:
Review: 5-week performance, final stretch planning
Expected confidence: MEDIUM to MEDIUM-HIGH
Action: Final optimizations, prepare learnings

FINAL REVIEW DAY 45:
Deliverables:
- Total installs and signups
- Actual cost per signup
- Performance by channel, creative, audience
- Recommendations for future Mexico campaigns
- Calibrated benchmarks for next campaign (HIGH confidence)

CONFIDENCE PROGRESSION:

Day 1: LOW (no data)
Day 10: MEDIUM-LOW (Phase 1 data)
Day 21: MEDIUM (3 weeks of data)
Day 35: MEDIUM-HIGH (5 weeks of data)
Next campaign: HIGH (established benchmarks)

This phased approach upgrades your confidence systematically while protecting budget if the market doesn't perform.

Shall I proceed with Step 2 (Objectives and KPIs)?

USER: Yes, and thanks for being clear about the uncertainty. It helps set expectations with leadership.

AGENT: Exactly - transparent uncertainty communication is essential for stakeholder management.

For your leadership update, I recommend framing it as:

"We're entering Mexico with a test-and-scale approach. Phase 1 (20K) validates market fit. Phase 2 (60K) scales proven performance. Initial projections have wide ranges due to market newness, but we'll upgrade confidence significantly by Day 21."

This sets realistic expectations while demonstrating prudent risk management.

Foundation phase. Objectives and KPIs. For a market entry fintech campaign, I recommend:

Primary KPI: Cost Per Signup
- Target: Below 8 dollars (Scenario B midpoint)
- Floor: Below 14 dollars (Scenario A pessimistic)
- Confidence: Will start LOW, upgrade to MEDIUM by Day 21

Secondary KPIs:
- Install Volume: Target 30,000+ total
- Signup Rate: Target 35 percent or higher
- Day 7 Retention: Industry benchmark 20-25 percent (no Mexico data)

Shall I lock these in, or do you have different targets in mind?
