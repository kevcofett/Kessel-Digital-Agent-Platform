DATA PROVENANCE FRAMEWORK v5.5

================================================================================
VERSION INFORMATION
================================================================================

VERSION: 5.5
DATE: January 2026
STATUS: Production Ready
COMPLIANCE: 6-Rule Compliant
PURPOSE: Data source categories, trust hierarchy, and conflict resolution
COMPLIANCE: 6-Rule Compliance Framework

================================================================================
OVERVIEW
================================================================================

The Media Planning Agent operates with data from multiple sources. This framework defines the four provenance categories, trust hierarchy, conflict resolution rules, and session isolation requirements.

v5.0 ADDITIONS:
- Web Research as explicit Category 3 source
- Confidence Level impact by data source
- Error handling when sources conflict
- Enhanced conflict resolution rules
- Research integration patterns

================================================================================
SECTION 1: DATA PROVENANCE CATEGORIES
================================================================================

CATEGORY 1: USER PROVIDED

Source: Information provided by user during current session
Trust Level: HIGHEST (for current session)
Confidence Impact: INCREASES confidence when consistent with benchmarks

Characteristics:
- Overrides all other data sources for current session
- Applies only to current session
- Stored in Dataverse SessionCustomizations table
- Not propagated to other users or sessions

Examples:
- Client-specific targets ("Our CAC target is $65")
- Actual performance data ("We are seeing $22 CPMs on Meta")
- Budget constraints ("Total budget is $500K")
- Channel exclusions ("We cannot use TikTok")
- Historical client data from uploaded files
- Verified platform data shared by user

Agent Behavior:
- Accept and acknowledge user-provided values immediately
- Use user values instead of all other sources for session
- Create SessionCustomization record in Dataverse
- Remind user these are session-specific if relevant
- Note when user data differs significantly from benchmarks

Confidence Level Effect:
- User data WITH historical backup: HIGH confidence
- User data WITHOUT historical backup: MEDIUM-HIGH confidence
- User data contradicting benchmarks: Flag but use, MEDIUM confidence

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CATEGORY 2: INTERNAL AGENT KNOWLEDGE BASE

Source: SharePoint-hosted knowledge base documents and registry files
Trust Level: HIGH
Confidence Impact: Baseline confidence level for projections

Characteristics:
- Pre-validated research and benchmarks
- Updated quarterly by administrators
- Version-controlled and auditable
- Available to all users
- Stable and reliable

Examples:
- KPI definitions and benchmarks (mpa_kpi table (Dataverse))
- Channel CPM/CPC ranges (mpa_channel table (Dataverse))
- Vertical budget benchmarks (mpa_vertical and mpa_benchmark tables (Dataverse))
- DSP/SSP fee benchmarks (mpa_partner table (Dataverse))
- Research documents (Budget_Allocation_Research_v1.docx)

Agent Behavior:
- Use as default values when user provides no override
- Cite as source when presenting benchmarks
- Never modify during conversations
- Cross-reference with web research when available

Confidence Level Effect:
- KB data alone: Baseline confidence per KPI type
- KB data validated by web research: INCREASE confidence
- KB data contradicted by web research: Note discrepancy, maintain KB default

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CATEGORY 3: PUBLIC INTERNET (WEB RESEARCH)

Source: Web search results and publicly available data
Trust Level: MEDIUM
Confidence Impact: Supplementary - can increase or flag concerns

Characteristics:
- Real-time but unvalidated
- May conflict with KB benchmarks
- Requires cross-reference validation
- Use for current events, news, recent changes
- Subject to search quality variation

Examples:
- Recent platform fee changes
- New channel launches or closures
- Industry news affecting recommendations
- Competitive intelligence from ad libraries
- Current market conditions
- Regional CPM variations

Agent Behavior:
- Use for supplementary information
- Cross-reference with multiple sources when possible
- Note uncertainty when data conflicts with KB
- Never use public data to override KB benchmarks without user confirmation
- Always cite source when presenting web findings
- Apply session isolation (do not modify KB)

Confidence Level Effect:
- Web data confirms KB: INCREASE confidence
- Web data supplements KB: No change to confidence
- Web data contradicts KB: FLAG discrepancy, maintain KB confidence
- Web data only (no KB reference): LOW confidence, treat as estimate

Research Integration Rules:
- Search when: Vertical mentioned, geography specified, competitor named
- Present findings: Cite source, note recency
- Resolve conflicts: KB default unless user confirms web data
- Session scope: Web findings apply to session only

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CATEGORY 4: DIRECT API

Source: Authenticated platform APIs (future capability)
Trust Level: HIGH
Confidence Impact: INCREASES confidence significantly for platform-specific metrics

Characteristics:
- Real-time, authoritative for specific platform
- Requires OAuth authentication
- Client-specific actual data
- Stored in CampaignPerformance tables

Examples:
- Actual spend from DV360 API
- Conversion data from Google Ads API
- Meta Ads performance metrics
- Platform-reported CPMs and fees

Agent Behavior:
- Use as ground truth for platform-specific metrics
- Reconcile with user-provided data
- Flag discrepancies between API and user data
- Store in Dataverse for historical analysis

Confidence Level Effect:
- API data available: HIGH confidence for that metric
- API data with historical pattern: VERY HIGH confidence
- API data conflicting with user data: Flag, ask for reconciliation

================================================================================
SECTION 2: TRUST HIERARCHY
================================================================================

2.1 PRIORITY ORDER FOR CONFLICTING DATA

Priority 1 (HIGHEST): USER PROVIDED
- Always wins for current session calculations
- User intent governs even if data seems incorrect
- Agent may flag concerns but must use user value

Priority 2: DIRECT API
- Use when available and user has not overridden
- Real-time platform truth

Priority 3: INTERNAL AGENT KB
- Default when no user or API data
- Stable, validated benchmarks

Priority 4 (LOWEST): PUBLIC INTERNET
- Supplementary only
- Never overrides higher sources without explicit user confirmation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2 CONFLICT RESOLUTION RULES

SCENARIO: User data vs KB benchmark
- Resolution: Use user data
- Agent response: "Using your provided CAC target of $65 instead of the benchmark range of $50-150."

SCENARIO: API reports different than user says
- Resolution: Flag discrepancy, ask user
- Agent response: "I notice your platform shows $18 CPM, but you mentioned $22. Which should I use for planning?"

SCENARIO: Web research contradicts KB
- Resolution: Note discrepancy, use KB, offer user choice
- Agent response: "Our benchmarks show X, but recent industry data suggests Y has changed. Shall I use the updated figure?"

SCENARIO: Multiple user inputs conflict
- Resolution: Ask for clarification
- Agent response: "Earlier you mentioned $150K budget, but now $175K. Which is the correct figure?"

SCENARIO: KB missing data for request
- Resolution: Use web research, note confidence reduction
- Agent response: "I do not have benchmark data for this niche vertical. Based on related industries and web research, I estimate X with MEDIUM-LOW confidence."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.3 CONFIDENCE LEVEL BY DATA SOURCE COMBINATION

Source Combination                          Confidence Effect
------------------------------------------ ---------------------------
User + API + KB aligned                     HIGH (maximum)
User + KB aligned                           MEDIUM-HIGH
KB alone                                    Baseline (per KPI type)
KB + Web research aligned                   Baseline + slight increase
User contradicts KB (user governs)          MEDIUM (flag)
Web research alone (no KB)                  LOW
Multiple sources conflict                   MEDIUM-LOW (flag all)

================================================================================
SECTION 3: SESSION ISOLATION
================================================================================

3.1 PRINCIPLE

User customizations MUST NOT affect other users or future sessions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2 IMPLEMENTATION ARCHITECTURE

SHARED KNOWLEDGE BASE (Read-Only):
- SharePoint Files
- Registry Files
- Research Documents
- Reference Data
- NEVER modified by agent during conversations

AGENT RUNTIME:

- Agent loads any prior customizations for this session
- No cross-session contamination
- Web research cache cleared

PHASE 2 - DURING SESSION:
- User provides custom values
- Agent conducts web research
- Agent creates SessionCustomization records
- Agent uses custom values for all calculations
- All sources tracked with provenance

PHASE 3 - SESSION END:
- Customizations remain in Dataverse
- Associated with plan if plan was created
- Available if user returns to same plan
- Web research findings NOT persisted

PHASE 4 - NEW SESSION (Same User, Same Plan):
- Agent loads prior customizations for that plan
- User can modify or reset to KB defaults
- Fresh web research may be triggered

PHASE 5 - NEW SESSION (Different User or Plan):
- Starts fresh with KB defaults
- No access to other users customizations
- Complete session isolation maintained

================================================================================
SECTION 4: WEB RESEARCH INTEGRATION (v5.0 NEW)
================================================================================

4.1 RESEARCH TRIGGER POINTS

AUTOMATIC TRIGGERS:
- Vertical mentioned: Search for vertical benchmarks
- Geography specified: Search for regional cost data
- Competitor named: Search ad libraries for competitive intel
- Platform mentioned: Search for recent changes
- Unusual request: Search for niche data

RESEARCH PROCESS:
- Identify information gap
- Formulate search query

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.2 RESEARCH QUALITY ASSESSMENT

HIGH QUALITY SOURCES (prioritize):
- Platform official documentation
- Industry association reports (IAB, ANA)
- Major research firms (eMarketer, Gartner, Nielsen)
- Company investor relations
- Government statistics

MEDIUM QUALITY SOURCES (use with caution):
- Industry news publications
- Marketing blogs from known experts
- Case studies with verifiable data
- Conference presentations

LOW QUALITY SOURCES (avoid or flag):
- Generic marketing blogs
- Outdated content (over 18 months)
- Sources without methodology
- Aggregator sites without original research

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.3 RESEARCH PRESENTATION FORMAT

When presenting web research findings:

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
"Based on recent industry data from [source name] ([date]):
- Finding 1: [specific data point]
- Finding 2: [specific data point]

This [confirms/differs from] our benchmark of [KB value].

Confidence: [LEVEL] because [reason].

Would you like me to use [KB value] or [web value] for this plan?"

================================================================================
SECTION 5: DATA CITATION REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

5.1 WHEN AGENT MUST CITE SOURCE

Context                         Citation Required    Format
------------------------------- ------------------- ---------------------------
Presenting KB benchmark         YES                 "Based on industry benchmarks..."
Using user-provided value       YES                 "Using your provided target of..."
Web search result               YES                 "According to [source]..."
API data                        YES                 "Your [platform] data shows..."
Calculation result              NO                  Present result directly
General recommendation          NO                  Present recommendation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.2 SAMPLE AGENT OUTPUTS BY PROVENANCE

KB SOURCE:
"Based on industry benchmarks for Retail, I am using a CAC target range of $20-80. Your target of $45 is well within this range."

USER OVERRIDE:
"I will use your provided CAC target of $65 instead of the benchmark range of $50-150 for this plan."

WEB RESEARCH:
"According to eMarketer's December 2024 report, retail CPMs have increased 15% year-over-year. This suggests our benchmark may be conservative."

CONFLICTING SOURCES:
"I notice a discrepancy: your Meta CPM of $22 is higher than the typical benchmark of $7-18. Should I use your actual rate or would you like to investigate this variance?"

================================================================================
SECTION 6: ERROR HANDLING FOR DATA CONFLICTS (v5.0 NEW)
================================================================================

6.1 CONFLICT DETECTION

Agent MUST detect and flag:
- User data outside KB benchmark range
- Web research contradicting KB
- Multiple user inputs that conflict
- API data mismatched with user claims
- Calculations producing impossible results

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.2 CONFLICT RESOLUTION FLOW

CONFLICT DETECTED
    |
    +-- User data vs KB?
    |   +-- Action: Flag the difference
    |   +-- Action: Use user data (priority)
    |   +-- Action: Note confidence impact
    |   +-- Response: "Your target of X is [above/below] the benchmark range of Y-Z. I will use your target. Note this may impact projection accuracy."
    |
    +-- Web vs KB?
    |   +-- Action: Present both values
    |   +-- Action: Default to KB
    |   +-- Action: Offer user choice
    |   +-- Response: "Our benchmarks show X, but recent data suggests Y. Which would you prefer to use?"
    |
    +-- User vs User (prior input)?
    |   +-- Action: Ask for clarification
    |   +-- Action: Do not proceed until resolved
    |   +-- Response: "Earlier you mentioned X, but now Y. Could you clarify which is correct?"
    |
    +-- Impossible calculation result?
        +-- Action: Identify likely cause
        +-- Action: Suggest verification
        +-- Response: "This calculation produced an unusual result. Let me verify the inputs with you..."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.3 GRACEFUL DEGRADATION

When data is missing or unreliable:

MISSING KB DATA:
- Use web research with citation
- Note reduced confidence
- Recommend verification

MISSING USER DATA:
- Use KB default
- Note assumption made
- Request confirmation

CONFLICTING ALL SOURCES:
- Present all values
- Explain discrepancy
- Ask user to decide
- Document decision rationale

================================================================================
SECTION 7: DATA VALIDATION RULES
================================================================================

7.1 INPUT VALIDATION

Data Type           Validation Rule              Agent Response if Invalid
------------------ ---------------------------- ----------------------------
Budget              Must be positive number      "Please provide a valid budget amount"
Percentage          Must be 0-100               "Percentages should be between 0 and 100"
CPM                 Must be positive, 1-100     Warn if outside typical range
CAC                 Must be positive            Accept any positive, warn if extreme
Date                Must be valid format        Ask for clarification
Duration            Must be positive days       "Campaign duration must be at least 1 day"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.2 REASONABLENESS CHECKS

Agent MUST flag values that seem unreasonable:
- CPM over $100 or under $1
- CAC over $1,000 (for non-enterprise B2B)
- ROAS under 1.0 (losing money)
- Budget under channel minimums
- Fee percentages over 50%
- Conversion rates over 20%
- CTR over 10%

Agent response pattern:
"That [metric] of [value] seems unusual. Most campaigns see [typical range]. Would you like to proceed with this value or verify it?"

================================================================================
