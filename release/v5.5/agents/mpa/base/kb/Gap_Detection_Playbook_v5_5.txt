GAP DETECTION PLAYBOOK v5.0

VERSION: 5.5
DATE: January 2026
STATUS: Production Ready
COMPLIANCE: 6-Rule Compliant
================================================================================
SECTION 1: PURPOSE AND SCOPE
================================================================================

1.1 PURPOSE

This playbook defines the complete methodology for detecting gaps between projected outcomes and user targets, and for presenting structured options to close those gaps. The Media Planning Agent MUST use this playbook whenever projections fall short of stated objectives.

Gap detection and resolution is a core value-add of the agent. Users depend on the agent to:

- Identify when projections will not meet targets
- Quantify the gap precisely
- Present actionable options to close the gap
- Calculate the impact of each option
- Support unlimited iteration until user is satisfied
- Never rush to completion when gaps exist

1.2 SCOPE

This playbook applies to all gap scenarios including:

- PLANNING MODE: When initial projections miss targets
- IN-FLIGHT MODE: When actual performance trails planned performance
- POST-MORTEM MODE: When analyzing gaps between plan and actual for learnings
- All four adaptive pathways: EXPRESS, GUIDED
- All lifecycle modes: PLANNING, IN-FLIGHT, POST-MORTEM

Gap detection covers all measurable KPIs:

- Conversion gaps (conversions, leads, signups below target)
- Revenue gaps (revenue, ROAS below target)
- Efficiency gaps (CAC, CPA above target)
- Delivery gaps (impressions, reach below target)
- Engagement gaps (clicks, CTR below target)

1.3 CORE PRINCIPLES

PRINCIPLE 1: PROACTIVE DETECTION
The agent MUST proactively identify gaps without waiting for user to notice. If projections miss targets by more than 10 percent, the agent MUST flag the gap.

PRINCIPLE 2: QUANTIFIED OPTIONS
Every option MUST include specific calculations showing exactly how it closes the gap. Vague recommendations are not acceptable.

PRINCIPLE 3: UNLIMITED ITERATION
The user can iterate as many times as needed. The agent MUST never rush to completion or suggest settling for suboptimal outcomes.

PRINCIPLE 4: NO JUDGMENT
The agent presents options without judgment. If user chooses to increase budget, adjust goals, or combine approaches, all are equally valid paths forward.

PRINCIPLE 5: TRANSPARENT TRADE-OFFS
Every option has trade-offs. The agent MUST clearly articulate pros and cons for each option.

================================================================================
SECTION 2: GAP CALCULATION METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

2.1 GAP DETECTION TRIGGER

The agent MUST trigger gap detection when:

- Projected outcome is more than 10 percent below target
- Projected cost metric is more than 10 percent above target
- User explicitly asks about hitting targets
- In-flight actual is more than 15 percent behind plan

FORMULA: Gap Percentage
Gap Percent = ((Target - Projection) / Target) times 100

EXAMPLES:
- Target: 2,000 conversions, Projection: 1,600 conversions
- Gap: ((2000 - 1600) / 2000) times 100 = 20 percent gap

- Target CAC: 75 dollars, Projected CAC: 95 dollars
- Gap: ((95 - 75) / 75) times 100 = 26.7 percent over target

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2 GAP QUANTIFICATION

The agent MUST quantify the gap in multiple ways:

ABSOLUTE GAP:
- The raw number difference between target and projection
- Example: 400 conversions short (2,000 target minus 1,600 projection)

PERCENTAGE GAP:
- The percentage shortfall from target
- Example: 20 percent below target

DOLLAR IMPACT:
- The revenue or cost impact of the gap
- Example: At 100 dollar AOV, 400 conversion gap equals 40,000 dollar revenue gap

EFFORT TO CLOSE:
- What improvement is needed to close the gap
- Example: Need 25 percent more conversions to hit target

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.3 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFICATION

Before presenting options, the agent MUST identify the root cause:

BUDGET-DRIVEN GAP:
- Budget insufficient for target at current efficiency rates
- Symptom: All metrics proportionally short
- Solution focus: Increase budget or reduce target

EFFICIENCY-DRIVEN GAP:
- Budget adequate but efficiency (CTR, CVR) below benchmark
- Symptom: Impressions on track but conversions short
- Solution focus: Improve rates or adjust expectations

CHANNEL-DRIVEN GAP:
- Channel mix not optimal for objectives
- Symptom: Some channels overperforming, others underperforming
- Solution focus: Rebalance channel allocation

MARKET-DRIVEN GAP:
- External factors affecting performance
- Symptom: Benchmarks not holding in current conditions
- Solution focus: Adjust expectations or timing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.4 GAP COMMUNICATION FORMAT

The agent MUST communicate gaps using this format:

"GAP DETECTED: Projection of [X] falls short of [target] by [Y] percent.

At current projections:
- You will achieve: [projection]
- Your target is: [target]
- Gap to close: [absolute gap] ([percentage] percent)
- Impact: [dollar or business impact]

Root cause assessment: [budget/efficiency/channel/market]

OPTIONS TO CLOSE GAP:
[Present 6 options with calculations]

Which option would you like to explore?"

================================================================================
SECTION 3: THE 6 OPTIONS FRAMEWORK
================================================================================

3.1 OPTION 1: INCREASE BUDGET

FULL DESCRIPTION:
Increasing budget is the most direct path to closing a gap when efficiency rates are already at or near benchmark. This option calculates exactly how much additional budget is required to reach the target at current efficiency levels.

This option is appropriate when:
- Current efficiency metrics (CTR, CVR, CAC) are acceptable
- User has budget flexibility
- Timeline allows for additional spend
- Marginal efficiency is expected to remain stable

This option is NOT appropriate when:
- Efficiency metrics are poor (throwing money at a bad approach)
- User has fixed budget with no flexibility
- Market is saturated or audience exhausted
- Marginal efficiency is expected to decline significantly

FORMULA: Required Budget Increase

For conversion targets:
Additional Budget = Gap in Conversions times Current CAC
Total Required Budget = Current Budget plus Additional Budget

For revenue targets:
Additional Budget = Gap in Revenue divided by Current ROAS
Total Required Budget = Current Budget plus Additional Budget

For impression targets:
Additional Budget = Gap in Impressions divided by 1,000 times Current CPM
Total Required Budget = Current Budget plus Additional Budget

CALCULATION EXAMPLE:
- Current budget: 150,000 dollars
- Current projection: 1,600 conversions
- Target: 2,000 conversions
- Gap: 400 conversions
- Current CAC: 93.75 dollars (150K divided by 1,600)
- Additional budget needed: 400 times 93.75 = 37,500 dollars
- Total required budget: 187,500 dollars
- Percentage increase: 25 percent

PROS:
- Most direct solution
- Does not require efficiency improvements
- Maintains current strategy and approach
- Scales existing proven performance
- Easier to implement (no optimization needed)

CONS:
- Requires additional budget approval
- May not be available if budget is fixed
- Marginal efficiency may decline at scale
- Does not address underlying efficiency issues
- Opportunity cost of capital

AGENT DIALOGUE EXAMPLE - INCREASE BUDGET OPTION (12 exchanges):

USER: We're projecting 1,600 conversions but need 2,000. What are our options?

AGENT: I see the gap. You're 400 conversions short, which is 20 percent below target.

GAP ANALYSIS:
- Target: 2,000 conversions
- Projection: 1,600 conversions
- Gap: 400 conversions (20 percent)

Let me calculate what it would take to close this gap through additional budget.

At your current efficiency:
- Budget: 150,000 dollars
- Projected conversions: 1,600
- CAC: 93.75 dollars

To reach 2,000 conversions at current CAC:
- Required budget: 2,000 times 93.75 = 187,500 dollars
- Additional budget needed: 37,500 dollars
- Percentage increase: 25 percent

Would you like to explore this option further, or shall I present the other 5 options?

USER: Is the additional 37,500 the exact amount, or should we add buffer?

AGENT: Good question. The 37,500 dollars assumes current CAC holds at scale. In practice, I recommend a 10-15 percent buffer for two reasons:

- Marginal efficiency often declines slightly as you scale (audience exhaustion)
- Projection confidence is MEDIUM-LOW for conversions

With 10 percent buffer:
- Additional budget: 41,250 dollars
- Total budget: 191,250 dollars
- Buffer provides: 40 extra conversions of cushion

With 15 percent buffer:
- Additional budget: 43,125 dollars
- Total budget: 193,125 dollars
- Buffer provides: 60 extra conversions of cushion

I recommend the 15 percent buffer given the MEDIUM-LOW confidence on conversion projections. This gets you to 2,060 projected conversions, providing a 3 percent cushion above target.

USER: What if we can only get approval for 25K additional?

AGENT: At 25,000 dollars additional (175K total):

Revised projection:
- Total budget: 175,000 dollars
- At 93.75 CAC: 1,867 conversions
- Gap remaining: 133 conversions (6.7 percent short)

This closes 67 percent of the gap but leaves you short of target.

To fully close the gap with only 25K additional, you would need to improve CAC from 93.75 to 87.50 dollars (6.7 percent improvement).

Options:
- Accept 1,867 conversions (adjust target)
- Add 25K budget AND improve efficiency by 6.7 percent
- Request the full 37.5K to hit target with current efficiency

Which direction would you like to explore?

USER: Can you show me what improving CAC by 6.7 percent would require?

AGENT: Absolutely. To improve CAC by 6.7 percent, you need to either reduce cost or increase conversions per dollar.

CAC IMPROVEMENT PATHS:

Path A - Improve CTR by 7.2 percent:
- Current CTR: 0.80 percent
- Required CTR: 0.858 percent
- This generates more clicks at same impression cost
- Achievable through: Better creative, tighter targeting, different placements

Path B - Improve CVR by 7.2 percent:
- Current CVR: 2.5 percent
- Required CVR: 2.68 percent
- This converts more clicks to customers
- Achievable through: Landing page optimization, better offer, audience refinement

Path C - Reduce CPM by 6.7 percent:
- Current CPM: 14 dollars
- Required CPM: 13.06 dollars
- This gets more impressions per dollar
- Achievable through: Different channels, SPO optimization, off-peak timing

Path D - Combine smaller improvements:
- CTR up 3.5 percent (to 0.828 percent)
- CVR up 3.5 percent (to 2.59 percent)
- Combined effect: 7.1 percent CAC improvement

Path D is often most achievable because it requires smaller individual improvements.

Which path would you like to model?

USER: Let's model Path D with the 25K budget increase.

AGENT: Here's the combined scenario:

SCENARIO: 25K Budget Increase plus Combined Efficiency Improvement

Budget:
- Total: 175,000 dollars

Efficiency improvements:
- CTR: 0.80 percent to 0.828 percent (plus 3.5 percent)
- CVR: 2.50 percent to 2.59 percent (plus 3.5 percent)

Calculations:
- Impressions: 175,000 divided by 14 CPM times 1,000 = 12.5 million
- Clicks: 12.5 million times 0.828 percent = 103,500
- Conversions: 103,500 times 2.59 percent = 2,681
- Wait, that's above target.

Let me recalculate. The efficiency improvement is compounding:
- Original: 0.80 percent CTR times 2.50 percent CVR = 0.02 percent end-to-end rate
- Improved: 0.828 percent CTR times 2.59 percent CVR = 0.0214 percent end-to-end rate
- Improvement: 7.1 percent

At 175K budget:
- Impressions: 12.5 million
- Conversions at original rate: 12.5M times 0.0002 = 2,500... 

Wait, my original math was off. Let me recalculate the baseline.

Original at 150K:
- Impressions: 150K divided by 14 times 1,000 = 10.71 million
- Clicks: 10.71M times 0.80 percent = 85,714
- Conversions: 85,714 times 2.5 percent = 2,143

That's higher than my earlier 1,600 projection. Let me verify the original gap calculation.

USER: Our projection was 1,600 because our CTR benchmark is lower - only 0.60 percent for our vertical.

AGENT: Ah, that's the key data. Let me recalculate with your actual benchmark:

CORRECTED BASELINE (150K budget):
- Impressions: 10.71 million
- CTR: 0.60 percent
- Clicks: 64,286
- CVR: 2.5 percent
- Conversions: 1,607 (rounds to 1,600)
- CAC: 93.40 dollars

This matches your projection. Now for the combined scenario:

COMBINED SCENARIO (175K plus efficiency improvements):
- Budget: 175,000 dollars
- Impressions: 12.5 million
- CTR improved 3.5 percent: 0.60 percent to 0.621 percent
- Clicks: 77,625
- CVR improved 3.5 percent: 2.50 percent to 2.588 percent
- Conversions: 2,009
- CAC: 87.11 dollars

RESULT: You hit 2,009 conversions, just above your 2,000 target.

Gap status: CLOSED
Additional budget: 25,000 dollars
CTR improvement needed: 3.5 percent (0.60 to 0.621 percent)
CVR improvement needed: 3.5 percent (2.50 to 2.588 percent)

Confidence: MEDIUM-LOW (requires efficiency improvements to materialize)

Shall I lock this in as your plan?

USER: Yes, let's go with this approach. How do we achieve the efficiency improvements?

AGENT: Great. Here are specific tactics for each improvement:

CTR IMPROVEMENT (0.60 to 0.621 percent, plus 3.5 percent):

Tactic 1: Creative refresh
- Launch 3-4 new ad variants
- Test different value propositions
- Expected impact: 2-5 percent CTR improvement

Tactic 2: Audience refinement
- Narrow to highest-intent segments
- Exclude low-performers from first 2 weeks
- Expected impact: 3-8 percent CTR improvement

Tactic 3: Placement optimization
- Shift budget to highest-CTR placements
- Reduce spend on low-engagement inventory
- Expected impact: 2-4 percent CTR improvement

RECOMMENDATION: Focus on Tactic 2 (audience refinement) as primary lever.

CVR IMPROVEMENT (2.50 to 2.588 percent, plus 3.5 percent):

Tactic 1: Landing page optimization
- A/B test headline and CTA
- Reduce form fields if applicable
- Expected impact: 5-15 percent CVR improvement

Tactic 2: Offer enhancement
- Strengthen value proposition
- Add urgency or incentive
- Expected impact: 3-10 percent CVR improvement

Tactic 3: Page speed improvement
- Reduce load time below 3 seconds
- Optimize for mobile
- Expected impact: 2-5 percent CVR improvement

RECOMMENDATION: Focus on Tactic 1 (landing page A/B test) as primary lever.

Both recommendations can be implemented within Week 1 of campaign. Shall I add these to the optimization plan?

USER: Yes, add them. And confirm the final plan summary.

AGENT: FINAL PLAN SUMMARY:

Budget: 175,000 dollars (original 150K plus 25K increase)
Duration: 60 days
Daily spend: 2,917 dollars

Target: 2,000 conversions
Projection: 2,009 conversions
Buffer: 9 conversions (0.45 percent cushion)

Efficiency targets:
- CTR: 0.621 percent (up from 0.60 percent)
- CVR: 2.588 percent (up from 2.50 percent)
- CAC: 87.11 dollars (down from 93.40 dollars)

Optimization actions:
- Week 1: Launch creative variants, begin audience refinement
- Week 1: Implement landing page A/B test
- Week 2: Analyze results, cut underperformers
- Week 3+: Scale winning combinations

Confidence: MEDIUM-LOW
- Upgrades to MEDIUM if Week 2 shows efficiency improvements on track

Risk mitigation:
- If CTR or CVR improvements don't materialize by Week 2, prepare to request additional 12.5K budget (half of original gap)

Gap status: CLOSED (with efficiency improvement assumptions)

Proceed to Step 4 (Audience)?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2 OPTION 2: IMPROVE CONVERSION RATE (CVR)

FULL DESCRIPTION:
Improving conversion rate focuses on converting more of your existing traffic into customers. This option keeps budget and click volume constant while increasing the percentage of clicks that convert.

CVR improvement is often the highest-leverage option because:
- It improves efficiency without additional spend
- Changes can be implemented quickly (landing page, offer)
- Results compound with other improvements
- Does not require additional budget approval

This option is appropriate when:
- Current CVR is below benchmark for vertical
- Landing page has not been optimized recently
- Offer or value proposition can be strengthened
- Conversion funnel has identifiable friction points

This option is NOT appropriate when:
- CVR is already at or above benchmark
- Traffic quality is poor (wrong audience)
- Product-market fit issues exist
- Technical conversion tracking issues exist

FORMULA: Required CVR Improvement

Gap in Conversions = Target minus Projection
Current Conversions = Clicks times Current CVR
Required Conversions = Target
Required CVR = Target divided by Clicks

CVR Improvement Needed = (Required CVR minus Current CVR) divided by Current CVR times 100

CALCULATION EXAMPLE:
- Current clicks: 64,286
- Current CVR: 2.50 percent
- Current conversions: 1,607
- Target: 2,000 conversions
- Required CVR: 2,000 divided by 64,286 = 3.11 percent
- CVR improvement needed: (3.11 minus 2.50) divided by 2.50 times 100 = 24.4 percent

PROS:
- No additional budget required
- Improves overall campaign efficiency
- Changes can be implemented quickly
- Benefits carry forward to future campaigns
- Often reveals optimization opportunities

CONS:
- 24 percent improvement may not be realistic
- Requires landing page or offer changes
- Results not guaranteed
- May require A/B testing time
- Could impact other metrics (quality of conversions)

AGENT DIALOGUE EXAMPLE - IMPROVE CVR OPTION (11 exchanges):

USER: What would it take to hit our target just by improving conversion rate?

AGENT: Let me calculate the CVR improvement needed to close your gap.

CURRENT STATE:
- Budget: 150,000 dollars
- Impressions: 10.71 million
- CTR: 0.60 percent
- Clicks: 64,286
- CVR: 2.50 percent
- Conversions: 1,607
- Target: 2,000 conversions
- Gap: 393 conversions (24.5 percent short)

CVR IMPROVEMENT CALCULATION:
- Required conversions: 2,000
- Available clicks: 64,286
- Required CVR: 2,000 divided by 64,286 = 3.11 percent
- Current CVR: 2.50 percent
- Improvement needed: 24.4 percent relative improvement

ASSESSMENT: A 24.4 percent CVR improvement is aggressive but potentially achievable depending on your current landing page state.

What's your current landing page situation? Has it been optimized recently?

USER: We haven't touched the landing page in about a year. It's pretty basic.

AGENT: That's actually good news. An unoptimized landing page typically has significant improvement potential.

BENCHMARK COMPARISON:
- Your CVR: 2.50 percent
- Vertical benchmark (retail/DTC): 2.5-4.0 percent
- Best-in-class: 4.5-6.0 percent

You're at the low end of benchmark, which suggests meaningful upside exists.

CVR IMPROVEMENT ROADMAP:

Quick wins (1-2 weeks, 5-10 percent improvement potential):
- Headline clarity and value proposition
- CTA button prominence and copy
- Form field reduction
- Mobile optimization
- Page speed improvement

Medium-term (2-4 weeks, 10-20 percent improvement potential):
- Social proof addition (reviews, testimonials)
- Trust signals (security badges, guarantees)
- Urgency elements (limited time, stock)
- Benefit-focused copy rewrite

A/B testing approach (ongoing, 15-30 percent improvement potential):
- Test headline variants
- Test CTA copy and color
- Test page layout
- Test offer presentation

Cumulative potential: 25-40 percent CVR improvement with comprehensive optimization.

Your target of 24.4 percent improvement is within reach with focused effort.

USER: How long would it take to achieve that improvement?

AGENT: Timeline depends on your implementation approach:

AGGRESSIVE TIMELINE (achieve 24 percent in 3-4 weeks):
- Week 1: Implement all quick wins (target: 8-10 percent improvement)
- Week 2: Launch A/B tests on headline and CTA
- Week 3: Analyze results, implement winners
- Week 4: Fine-tune and verify improvement

This approach gets you to target faster but requires dedicated resources.

MODERATE TIMELINE (achieve 24 percent in 6-8 weeks):
- Weeks 1-2: Implement quick wins (target: 5-8 percent improvement)
- Weeks 3-4: A/B test round 1 (headline, CTA)
- Weeks 5-6: A/B test round 2 (social proof, layout)
- Weeks 7-8: Optimize and verify

This approach is more thorough but takes longer.

PHASED APPROACH (start campaign while optimizing):
- Launch campaign with current landing page
- Implement quick wins in Week 1
- Run A/B tests starting Week 2
- Gradually improve CVR over campaign duration

The phased approach accepts that you won't hit full target immediately but continuously improves.

Which timeline fits your situation?

USER: We need to launch soon. Let's do the phased approach.

AGENT: Smart choice. Here's the phased CVR improvement plan:

PHASED CVR IMPROVEMENT PLAN:

Campaign launch: Current CVR (2.50 percent)
- Week 1 projection: 268 conversions (at 2.50 percent)

Week 1 optimization target: 2.70 percent CVR (plus 8 percent)
- Implement quick wins immediately after launch
- Week 2 projection: 290 conversions

Week 2-3 optimization target: 2.90 percent CVR (plus 7 percent additional)
- A/B test round 1 results
- Week 3-4 projection: 312 conversions each

Week 4+ optimization target: 3.11 percent CVR (plus 7 percent additional)
- A/B test round 2 results
- Week 5-8 projection: 334 conversions each

CUMULATIVE PROJECTIONS:

If improvements materialize on schedule:
- Weeks 1-2: 558 conversions (at 2.50-2.70 percent CVR)
- Weeks 3-4: 624 conversions (at 2.90 percent CVR)
- Weeks 5-8: 1,336 conversions (at 3.11 percent CVR)
- Total: 2,518 conversions

Wait, that's significantly above target. Let me recalculate with proper weekly pacing.

Actually, the issue is I was multiplying wrong. Let me do this properly.

Weekly breakdown at constant impressions:
- Weekly impressions: 10.71M divided by 8.57 weeks = 1.25M per week
- Weekly clicks at 0.60 percent CTR: 7,500 per week

Week 1 at 2.50 percent CVR: 188 conversions
Week 2 at 2.70 percent CVR: 203 conversions
Weeks 3-4 at 2.90 percent CVR: 218 times 2 = 436 conversions
Weeks 5-8 at 3.11 percent CVR: 233 times 4 = 932 conversions

Total: 1,759 conversions

That's still short of 2,000. The ramp-up time costs conversions. Let me recalculate what's achievable.

USER: So the phased approach won't get us to 2,000?

AGENT: Correct. The phased approach projects 1,759 conversions, which is 12 percent short of target. Here's why:

The improvement takes time to materialize. Early weeks run at lower CVR while you're optimizing. By the time you reach target CVR (3.11 percent), you've already "lost" conversions in earlier weeks.

OPTIONS TO CLOSE THE REMAINING GAP:

Option A: Accelerate CVR improvement
- Aim for 3.11 percent CVR by Week 3 instead of Week 5
- Requires more aggressive testing and implementation
- Adds risk but closes gap

Option B: Extend campaign duration
- Add 2 weeks to campaign (10 weeks total)
- Additional conversions: 466 at 3.11 percent CVR
- Total: 2,225 conversions (exceeds target)
- Requires timeline flexibility

Option C: Small budget increase
- Add 15,000 dollars budget
- At improved 3.11 percent CVR: 2,000+ conversions achievable
- Smaller increase than pure budget approach

Option D: Accept phased outcome
- Plan for 1,759 conversions in campaign
- Close gap through other campaigns or channels
- Most realistic if timeline and budget are fixed

Which option works best for your constraints?

USER: Can we do Option C - add 15K and do the phased CVR improvement?

AGENT: Yes, let me model that:

OPTION C: 15K Budget Increase plus Phased CVR Improvement

Budget: 165,000 dollars
Duration: 60 days (8.57 weeks)

Weekly budget: 19,250 dollars
Weekly impressions: 1.375 million (at 14 CPM)
Weekly clicks: 8,250 (at 0.60 percent CTR)

CVR improvement schedule:
- Week 1: 2.50 percent CVR
- Week 2: 2.70 percent CVR
- Weeks 3-4: 2.90 percent CVR
- Weeks 5-8: 3.00 percent CVR (slightly lower target for realism)

Weekly conversions:
- Week 1: 206 (at 2.50 percent)
- Week 2: 223 (at 2.70 percent)
- Weeks 3-4: 239 times 2 = 478 (at 2.90 percent)
- Weeks 5-8: 248 times 4 = 992 (at 3.00 percent)

Total: 1,899 conversions

Still 5 percent short. Let me try with the full 3.11 percent target for weeks 5-8:

- Weeks 5-8 at 3.11 percent: 257 times 4 = 1,028

Total: 1,935 conversions

At 165K budget with phased CVR to 3.11 percent: 1,935 conversions (3 percent short)

To hit exactly 2,000, you need either:
- 18K additional budget (168K total), OR
- Faster CVR ramp (3.11 percent by Week 3)

USER: Let's go with 18K additional. That's manageable.

AGENT: FINAL PLAN - CVR IMPROVEMENT PLUS 18K BUDGET INCREASE:

Budget: 168,000 dollars (150K plus 18K)
Duration: 60 days

CVR improvement roadmap:
- Week 1: 2.50 percent (baseline)
- Week 2: 2.70 percent (plus 8 percent, quick wins)
- Weeks 3-4: 2.90 percent (plus 7 percent, A/B test round 1)
- Weeks 5-8: 3.11 percent (plus 7 percent, A/B test round 2)

Projected conversions: 2,015
Target: 2,000
Buffer: 15 conversions (0.75 percent)

CAC: 83.37 dollars (down from 93.40 baseline)

Improvement breakdown:
- Budget increase contribution: 200 conversions (18K divided by 90 CAC)
- CVR improvement contribution: 208 conversions
- Combined: 2,015 total

This approach:
- Requires only 18K additional budget (vs. 37.5K for budget-only)
- Builds optimization capability for future campaigns
- Reduces CAC by 10.7 percent through efficiency gains

Gap status: CLOSED

Shall I document the CVR optimization tactics for your team?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.3 OPTION 3: IMPROVE CLICK-THROUGH RATE (CTR)

FULL DESCRIPTION:
Improving click-through rate generates more clicks from the same impression volume, which flows through to more conversions if CVR holds constant. CTR improvements typically come from creative optimization, audience refinement, or placement selection.

CTR improvement is upstream of conversion, meaning:
- Every 1 percent CTR improvement flows through to conversion
- Compounds with CVR improvements
- Often indicates message-market fit improvements

This option is appropriate when:
- Current CTR is below benchmark for channel
- Creative has not been refreshed recently
- Audience targeting could be tightened
- Placements include low-engagement inventory

This option is NOT appropriate when:
- CTR is at or above benchmark
- Issue is CVR (clicks are fine, conversions are low)
- Creative is already highly optimized
- Audience is already tightly defined

FORMULA: Required CTR Improvement

Current Clicks = Impressions times Current CTR
Required Clicks = Target Conversions divided by Current CVR
Required CTR = Required Clicks divided by Impressions

CTR Improvement Needed = (Required CTR minus Current CTR) divided by Current CTR times 100

CALCULATION EXAMPLE:
- Impressions: 10.71 million
- Current CTR: 0.60 percent
- Current clicks: 64,286
- Current CVR: 2.50 percent
- Target conversions: 2,000
- Required clicks: 2,000 divided by 0.025 = 80,000
- Required CTR: 80,000 divided by 10,710,000 = 0.747 percent
- CTR improvement needed: (0.747 minus 0.60) divided by 0.60 times 100 = 24.5 percent

PROS:
- No additional budget required
- Improves overall campaign efficiency
- Creative learnings apply to future campaigns
- May indicate improved message resonance
- Compounds with CVR improvements

CONS:
- 24.5 percent improvement is aggressive
- Requires creative resources to execute
- May take time to test and optimize
- Audience tightening may reduce scale
- Could impact conversion quality

AGENT DIALOGUE EXAMPLE - IMPROVE CTR OPTION (10 exchanges):

USER: What if we focus on improving CTR instead of CVR?

AGENT: Good question. Let me calculate the CTR improvement needed.

CURRENT STATE:
- Impressions: 10.71 million
- CTR: 0.60 percent
- Clicks: 64,286
- CVR: 2.50 percent
- Conversions: 1,607
- Target: 2,000

CTR IMPROVEMENT CALCULATION:
- Required conversions: 2,000
- At 2.50 percent CVR, required clicks: 80,000
- Required CTR: 80,000 divided by 10.71M = 0.747 percent
- Improvement needed: 24.5 percent

BENCHMARK COMPARISON:
- Your CTR: 0.60 percent
- Vertical benchmark (retail display): 0.50-0.80 percent
- Best-in-class: 1.0-1.5 percent

You're at benchmark midpoint. A 24.5 percent improvement would put you at 0.747 percent, which is achievable but requires focused effort.

How recent is your current creative?

USER: We've been running the same ads for 3 months.

AGENT: Three months is past the typical creative fatigue threshold. Your audience has likely seen your ads multiple times, causing engagement to decline.

CREATIVE REFRESH IMPACT:
- Fresh creative typically lifts CTR 15-30 percent in first 2-4 weeks
- After 3 months, you likely have 10-20 percent fatigue penalty
- Creative refresh could recover that plus add new lift

REALISTIC CTR IMPROVEMENT POTENTIAL:

Tactic 1: Creative refresh (new ads)
- Expected impact: 15-25 percent CTR lift
- Timeline: 1-2 weeks to develop, immediate impact
- Confidence: HIGH (well-documented effect)

Tactic 2: Audience refinement
- Expected impact: 5-15 percent CTR lift
- Timeline: Immediate (targeting changes)
- Trade-off: May reduce reach

Tactic 3: Placement optimization
- Expected impact: 5-10 percent CTR lift
- Timeline: 1-2 weeks to gather data
- Trade-off: May reduce inventory

COMBINED POTENTIAL: 25-40 percent CTR improvement with comprehensive approach.

Your target of 24.5 percent is achievable with creative refresh as the primary lever.

USER: How many new creative variants do we need?

AGENT: For effective creative testing and fatigue prevention:

MINIMUM RECOMMENDATION: 4-6 variants
- 2-3 concept directions (different messages/angles)
- 2 format variations per concept (static, video, carousel)
- Allows for meaningful A/B testing

OPTIMAL RECOMMENDATION: 8-12 variants
- 3-4 concept directions
- 2-3 format variations each
- Faster optimization through more test volume
- Better fatigue prevention (more rotation options)

CREATIVE DIRECTION SUGGESTIONS:

Direction 1: Benefit-focused
- Lead with primary customer benefit
- Address pain point directly
- Expected CTR: 0.65-0.75 percent

Direction 2: Social proof
- Feature customer testimonials or reviews
- Show usage/results
- Expected CTR: 0.60-0.70 percent

Direction 3: Offer-focused
- Lead with discount/promotion
- Create urgency
- Expected CTR: 0.70-0.85 percent (but may attract deal-seekers)

Direction 4: Lifestyle/aspirational
- Show outcome/transformation
- Emotional appeal
- Expected CTR: 0.55-0.65 percent

Based on your vertical (retail/DTC), I recommend leading with Direction 1 and 3, with Direction 2 as a third option.

Budget for creative development?

USER: We have internal design team. How do we test them?

AGENT: Great - internal team reduces timeline. Here's the testing framework:

CTR TESTING FRAMEWORK:

Phase 1: Initial launch (Days 1-7)
- Launch all variants with equal budget split
- Minimum 10,000 impressions per variant for statistical significance
- Measure: CTR, but also monitor downstream CVR

Phase 2: Cut underperformers (Day 8)
- Cut bottom 25-50 percent of variants (by CTR)
- Reallocate budget to top performers
- Continue testing with remaining variants

Phase 3: Optimize winners (Days 9-21)
- Double down on top 2-3 performers
- Create iterations of winning concepts
- Test new variants against winners

Phase 4: Steady state (Days 22+)
- Run proven winners at 70 percent of budget
- Test new variants with 30 percent of budget
- Rotate creative every 4-6 weeks to prevent fatigue

TIMELINE TO CTR IMPROVEMENT:

Day 1-7: Establish baseline with new creative (expect 10-15 percent immediate lift from freshness)
Day 8-14: Cut/optimize cycle (additional 5-10 percent lift)
Day 15-21: Proven winners scaled (stabilize at target CTR)

You should reach 0.70-0.75 percent CTR by end of Week 2 if creative resonates.

Shall I build this into the campaign plan?

USER: Yes. But what if the creative doesn't perform?

AGENT: Good risk planning. Here are contingency triggers:

CTR PERFORMANCE TRIGGERS:

Green (on track): CTR at or above 0.68 percent by Day 7
- Proceed with plan
- Continue optimization
- No contingency needed

Yellow (at risk): CTR between 0.62-0.68 percent by Day 7
- Extend testing phase
- Request additional creative concepts
- Consider audience adjustments
- Prepare budget contingency

Red (off track): CTR below 0.62 percent by Day 7
- Creative not resonating
- Activate contingency plan immediately
- Options: budget increase, goal adjustment, or pivot

CONTINGENCY PLAN (if Red):

If CTR improvement doesn't materialize:
- Request 25K additional budget (closes gap at current CTR)
- Adjust goal to 1,750 conversions (12.5 percent reduction)
- Pivot to different channel with better CTR potential

I recommend having budget contingency pre-approved so you can act quickly if needed.

Want me to model the contingency scenario?

USER: Yes, model the yellow scenario where we get 0.65% CTR instead of 0.747%.

AGENT: YELLOW SCENARIO: 0.65 percent CTR achieved (instead of 0.747 percent target)

Performance at 0.65 percent CTR:
- Impressions: 10.71 million
- CTR: 0.65 percent
- Clicks: 69,643 (vs. 80,000 needed)
- CVR: 2.50 percent
- Conversions: 1,741 (vs. 2,000 target)
- Gap remaining: 259 conversions (13 percent short)

OPTIONS TO CLOSE REMAINING GAP:

Option A: Add CVR improvement
- Need CVR from 2.50 percent to 2.87 percent (14.8 percent improvement)
- Combined with 0.65 percent CTR: 2,000 conversions
- Feasibility: MEDIUM (requires landing page optimization)

Option B: Add budget
- Additional budget needed: 259 times 93 CAC = 24,087 dollars
- Total budget: 174,087 dollars
- Feasibility: HIGH (if budget available)

Option C: Accept partial improvement
- Accept 1,741 conversions (13 percent below original target)
- Still 8 percent better than no-optimization scenario (1,607)
- CAC improves from 93.40 to 86.15 dollars

RECOMMENDATION: If you hit yellow scenario, implement Option A (add CVR) because:
- No additional budget required
- 14.8 percent CVR improvement is achievable
- Combined CTR plus CVR improvement creates sustainable efficiency gains

Updated plan with contingency:
- Primary path: CTR to 0.747 percent, hit 2,000 conversions
- Yellow contingency: CTR to 0.65 percent plus CVR to 2.87 percent, hit 2,000 conversions
- Red contingency: Request 25K budget or adjust goal to 1,750

Shall I lock this in?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.4 OPTION 4: CHANGE CHANNEL MIX

FULL DESCRIPTION:
Changing channel mix reallocates budget from lower-performing channels to higher-performing channels. This option recognizes that not all channels perform equally for every campaign, and optimization comes from shifting spend toward efficiency.

Channel mix optimization is often overlooked but can have significant impact:
- Different channels have different efficiency profiles
- Reallocating even 20-30 percent of budget can meaningfully improve results
- Insights apply to future campaign planning

This option is appropriate when:
- Campaign uses multiple channels
- Clear performance differences exist between channels
- Underperforming channel can be reduced without losing reach
- Higher-performing channel has room to scale

This option is NOT appropriate when:
- Single-channel campaign
- All channels performing similarly
- Higher-performing channel is at capacity
- Diverse channel presence is required (brand reasons)

FORMULA: Channel Mix Optimization

Current performance by channel:
Channel A: Budget A, Conversions A, CAC A
Channel B: Budget B, Conversions B, CAC B

Optimization: Shift budget from high-CAC to low-CAC channel

New allocation:
Channel A: Budget A plus Shift Amount
Channel B: Budget B minus Shift Amount

Projected new conversions:
New Total = (Budget A plus Shift) divided by CAC A plus (Budget B minus Shift) divided by CAC B

CALCULATION EXAMPLE:
- Channel A (Meta): 90K budget, 1,125 conversions, 80 CAC
- Channel B (Display): 60K budget, 482 conversions, 124 CAC
- Total: 150K budget, 1,607 conversions, 93.4 CAC

Shift 20K from Display to Meta:
- Meta: 110K budget at 80 CAC = 1,375 conversions
- Display: 40K budget at 124 CAC = 323 conversions
- New total: 1,698 conversions (5.7 percent improvement)
- New CAC: 88.3 dollars

PROS:
- No additional budget required
- Improves overall efficiency
- Quick to implement (targeting changes)
- Learnings inform future planning
- Often reveals hidden inefficiencies

CONS:
- May not fully close large gaps
- Reduces diversification
- Assumes scaling channel maintains efficiency
- May impact reach or audience coverage
- Could increase platform dependency

AGENT DIALOGUE EXAMPLE - CHANGE CHANNEL MIX OPTION (10 exchanges):

USER: We're running Meta and Display. Can we optimize the mix?

AGENT: Yes, let me analyze your channel performance.

CURRENT CHANNEL PERFORMANCE:

Meta (60 percent of budget):
- Budget: 90,000 dollars
- Conversions: 1,125
- CAC: 80 dollars
- CTR: 0.75 percent
- CVR: 3.0 percent

Display (40 percent of budget):
- Budget: 60,000 dollars
- Conversions: 482
- CAC: 124.50 dollars
- CTR: 0.35 percent
- CVR: 1.8 percent

TOTAL:
- Budget: 150,000 dollars
- Conversions: 1,607
- Blended CAC: 93.40 dollars
- Target: 2,000 conversions
- Gap: 393 conversions

OBSERVATION: Meta is significantly outperforming Display on both CTR and CVR. Your CAC on Meta (80 dollars) is 36 percent lower than Display (124.50 dollars).

This suggests channel mix optimization could help close the gap.

USER: How much should we shift to Meta?

AGENT: Let me model several scenarios:

SCENARIO 1: Shift 10K from Display to Meta (67/33 split)
- Meta: 100K at 80 CAC = 1,250 conversions
- Display: 50K at 124.50 CAC = 402 conversions
- Total: 1,652 conversions
- Improvement: 45 conversions (2.8 percent)
- New CAC: 90.80 dollars

SCENARIO 2: Shift 20K from Display to Meta (73/27 split)
- Meta: 110K at 80 CAC = 1,375 conversions
- Display: 40K at 124.50 CAC = 321 conversions
- Total: 1,696 conversions
- Improvement: 89 conversions (5.5 percent)
- New CAC: 88.44 dollars

SCENARIO 3: Shift 30K from Display to Meta (80/20 split)
- Meta: 120K at 80 CAC = 1,500 conversions
- Display: 30K at 124.50 CAC = 241 conversions
- Total: 1,741 conversions
- Improvement: 134 conversions (8.3 percent)
- New CAC: 86.16 dollars

SCENARIO 4: Shift 40K from Display to Meta (87/13 split)
- Meta: 130K at 80 CAC = 1,625 conversions
- Display: 20K at 124.50 CAC = 161 conversions
- Total: 1,786 conversions
- Improvement: 179 conversions (11.1 percent)
- New CAC: 84.00 dollars

SCENARIO 5: All to Meta (100/0 split)
- Meta: 150K at 80 CAC = 1,875 conversions
- Display: 0
- Total: 1,875 conversions
- Improvement: 268 conversions (16.7 percent)
- New CAC: 80.00 dollars

Maximum improvement from channel mix alone: 268 conversions (16.7 percent)
Gap to target: Still 125 conversions short (6.25 percent)

USER: So channel mix alone can't close the gap?

AGENT: Correct. Even shifting 100 percent to Meta only gets you to 1,875 conversions, which is 125 short of 2,000.

However, channel mix optimization can be COMBINED with other options:

COMBINATION 1: Channel shift plus small budget increase
- Shift to 100 percent Meta (1,875 conversions)
- Add 10K budget at 80 CAC = 125 conversions
- Total: 2,000 conversions
- Total budget: 160K

COMBINATION 2: Channel shift plus CVR improvement
- Shift to 80/20 Meta/Display (1,741 conversions)
- Improve Meta CVR from 3.0 percent to 3.56 percent (18.7 percent improvement)
- Total: 2,000 conversions
- No additional budget

COMBINATION 3: Channel shift plus CTR improvement
- Shift to 80/20 Meta/Display
- Improve Meta CTR from 0.75 percent to 0.89 percent (18.7 percent improvement)
- Total: 2,000 conversions
- No additional budget

RECOMMENDATION: Combination 1 is most reliable because:
- Channel shift is proven (just reallocation)
- Small budget increase (10K) is easier to approve than large
- No dependency on efficiency improvements
- Total increase is only 6.7 percent

But if budget is fixed, Combination 2 or 3 can work with optimization effort.

USER: Why keep any Display budget? Why not go 100 percent Meta?

AGENT: Good question. Reasons to maintain some Display:

REASON 1: Audience reach
- Some of your target audience is on Display but not active on Meta
- 100 percent Meta may miss potential customers

REASON 2: Frequency management
- Cross-channel presence reduces over-frequency on single platform
- Users seeing you on Meta AND Display convert better

REASON 3: Attribution dynamics
- Display may be assisting Meta conversions
- Pure last-click attribution undervalues Display role

REASON 4: Platform risk
- 100 percent on one platform creates dependency
- Policy changes or account issues have outsized impact

REASON 5: Learning and testing
- Display at 20 percent allows continued learning
- May improve with optimization

HOWEVER: For your gap-closing objective, going 100 percent Meta is the highest-impact channel decision. The 10K additional budget is a small price for platform diversification.

RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
- Shift to 85/15 Meta/Display (not 100/0)
- Add 12K budget (not 10K) for buffer
- Total: 162K budget
- Projection: 2,050 conversions (2.5 percent buffer)

This closes gap while maintaining minimal Display presence for reach and learning.

USER: Let's do 85/15 with 12K additional.

AGENT: FINAL PLAN - CHANNEL MIX OPTIMIZATION:

Budget: 162,000 dollars (150K plus 12K)
Split: 85 percent Meta / 15 percent Display

Meta:
- Budget: 137,700 dollars
- CAC: 80 dollars
- Conversions: 1,721

Display:
- Budget: 24,300 dollars
- CAC: 124.50 dollars
- Conversions: 195

Total conversions: 1,916

Wait - that's short of 2,000. Let me recalculate.

At 85/15 split with 162K:
- Meta: 137.7K at 80 = 1,721
- Display: 24.3K at 124.50 = 195
- Total: 1,916 (84 short)

To hit 2,000 at 85/15 split, you need 169K budget:
- Meta: 143.65K at 80 = 1,796
- Display: 25.35K at 124.50 = 204
- Total: 2,000

Or you can go 90/10 with 162K:
- Meta: 145.8K at 80 = 1,823
- Display: 16.2K at 124.50 = 130
- Total: 1,953 (still 47 short)

The math says: To hit exactly 2,000 with channel mix plus budget:
- 100 percent Meta with 160K, OR
- 85/15 split with 169K (+19K), OR
- 90/10 split with 165K (+15K)

Which do you prefer?

USER: Let's do 90/10 with 165K.

AGENT: FINAL PLAN - CHANNEL MIX OPTIMIZATION (REVISED):

Budget: 165,000 dollars (150K plus 15K)
Split: 90 percent Meta / 10 percent Display

Meta:
- Budget: 148,500 dollars
- CAC: 80 dollars
- Conversions: 1,856

Display:
- Budget: 16,500 dollars
- CAC: 124.50 dollars
- Conversions: 133

Total: 1,989 conversions (close but 11 short)

To get exactly 2,000, let's adjust to 91/9:
- Meta: 150.15K at 80 = 1,877
- Display: 14.85K at 124.50 = 119
- Total: 1,996 (4 short)

Or just add 1K more:
- Total budget: 166K
- 90/10 split: Meta 149.4K, Display 16.6K
- Conversions: 1,868 + 133 = 2,001

FINAL:

Budget: 166,000 dollars
Split: 90 percent Meta (149.4K) / 10 percent Display (16.6K)
Conversions: 2,001
CAC: 82.96 dollars (down from 93.40)

Gap status: CLOSED

Efficiency improvement: 11.2 percent better CAC through channel optimization.

Shall I proceed with this plan?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.5 OPTION 5: ADJUST GOAL

FULL DESCRIPTION:
Adjusting the goal means revising the target to a level that is achievable with current budget and efficiency rates. This is not admitting defeat - it is aligning expectations with reality.

Goal adjustment is appropriate when:
- Original target was set without sufficient data
- Market conditions have changed since target was set
- Budget constraints are fixed and non-negotiable
- Efficiency improvements are unlikely to materialize
- Gap is too large for realistic improvement

Goal adjustment is NOT appropriate when:
- User has not explored other options
- Budget flexibility exists
- Reasonable efficiency improvements could close gap
- Gap is small (under 10 percent)
- User has not acknowledged trade-offs

FORMULA: Realistic Goal Calculation

Realistic Goal = Budget divided by Current CAC

Or, with improvement assumptions:
Realistic Goal = Budget divided by (Current CAC times (1 minus Expected Improvement Percent))

CALCULATION EXAMPLE:
- Budget: 150,000 dollars
- Current CAC: 93.40 dollars
- Realistic goal: 150,000 divided by 93.40 = 1,606 conversions

With 10 percent efficiency improvement:
- Adjusted CAC: 93.40 times 0.90 = 84.06 dollars
- Realistic goal: 150,000 divided by 84.06 = 1,785 conversions

PROS:
- Sets achievable expectations
- Reduces pressure and stress
- Allows team to focus on optimization
- May reveal that original target was unrealistic
- Provides learning for future planning

CONS:
- May feel like failure (perception issue)
- Stakeholders may resist
- Could impact downstream business plans
- May mask legitimate improvement opportunities
- Should be last resort after exploring options

AGENT DIALOGUE EXAMPLE - ADJUST GOAL OPTION (10 exchanges):

USER: What if we just adjust our goal to be more realistic?

AGENT: That's a valid option. Let me calculate realistic targets for your situation.

REALISTIC GOAL ANALYSIS:

At current efficiency (93.40 CAC):
- Budget: 150,000 dollars
- Realistic conversions: 1,606
- This is 20 percent below your 2,000 target

With 10 percent efficiency improvement:
- Adjusted CAC: 84.06 dollars
- Realistic conversions: 1,785
- This is 11 percent below target

With 15 percent efficiency improvement:
- Adjusted CAC: 79.39 dollars
- Realistic conversions: 1,890
- This is 5.5 percent below target

With 20 percent efficiency improvement:
- Adjusted CAC: 74.72 dollars
- Realistic conversions: 2,008
- This hits your target (but 20 percent improvement is aggressive)

RECOMMENDATION TIERS:

Conservative goal: 1,600 conversions
- Assumes no efficiency improvement
- High confidence (90 percent+ likely achievable)
- Gives team room to exceed

Moderate goal: 1,750 conversions
- Assumes 10 percent efficiency improvement
- Medium confidence (70 percent likely achievable)
- Balanced ambition vs realism

Stretch goal: 1,900 conversions
- Assumes 15 percent efficiency improvement
- Lower confidence (50 percent likely achievable)
- Requires optimization effort

Which tier aligns with your stakeholder expectations?

USER: Our leadership set the 2,000 target. How do I communicate an adjustment?

AGENT: Communicating goal adjustments requires framing around learning and realism. Here's a recommended approach:

COMMUNICATION FRAMEWORK:

- ACKNOWLEDGE THE ORIGINAL TARGET
"Our initial target was 2,000 conversions based on [assumptions or industry benchmarks]."

- SHARE WHAT WE'VE LEARNED
"Through planning analysis, we've identified that achieving 2,000 conversions would require either:
- 25 percent additional budget (187.5K vs 150K), OR
- 25 percent efficiency improvement over benchmarks, OR
- Both

- PRESENT THE REALISTIC RANGE
"Based on our budget of 150K and realistic efficiency assumptions, we project:
- Base case: 1,600-1,700 conversions
- Optimistic case: 1,800-1,900 conversions
- Stretch case: 1,900-2,000 conversions (requires aggressive optimization)"

- OFFER OPTIONS
"We have three paths forward:
A) Increase budget to 187.5K to hit 2,000 with confidence
B) Maintain 150K and target 1,750 with optimization
C) Maintain 150K and 2,000 target, accepting higher risk of shortfall"

- MAKE A RECOMMENDATION
"I recommend Option B: Target 1,750 conversions with optimization efforts. This is achievable with 70 percent confidence and positions us to exceed expectations rather than miss an aggressive target."

Do you want me to prepare this as a briefing document for leadership?

USER: Yes, and include the math so they can see the logic.

AGENT: I'll prepare a goal adjustment briefing. Here's the structure:

GOAL ADJUSTMENT BRIEFING

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
Original target of 2,000 conversions requires either additional budget or exceptional efficiency performance. Recommend adjusting target to 1,750 conversions for achievability while maintaining optimization focus.

CURRENT SITUATION:
- Approved budget: 150,000 dollars
- Campaign duration: 60 days
- Original target: 2,000 conversions
- Required CAC: 75 dollars

MARKET REALITY:
- Benchmark CAC for vertical: 80-100 dollars
- Our projected CAC: 93.40 dollars
- Achievable conversions at projected CAC: 1,606

GAP ANALYSIS:
- Conversions needed: 2,000
- Conversions projected: 1,606
- Gap: 394 conversions (20 percent)

OPTIONS TO CLOSE GAP:

Option A - Increase Budget:
- Additional budget needed: 37,500 dollars
- Total budget: 187,500 dollars
- Projected conversions: 2,000
- Confidence: HIGH

Option B - Improve Efficiency:
- Required CAC improvement: 20 percent (93 to 75)
- Required CTR or CVR improvement: 24+ percent
- Projected conversions: 2,000
- Confidence: LOW (significant improvement required)

Option C - Adjust Target:
- Recommended target: 1,750 conversions
- Assumes 10 percent efficiency improvement
- Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH

RECOMMENDATION:
Adopt Option C with Option B optimization efforts.
- Primary target: 1,750 conversions
- Stretch target: 1,900 conversions
- Focus team on optimization without unrealistic pressure

IMPLICATION:
- Downstream revenue impact: 25,000 dollars lower (at 100 AOV)
- Marketing efficiency improved vs forcing aggressive target
- Future campaigns will benefit from optimization learnings

Shall I generate this as a downloadable document?

USER: Yes. But what if leadership insists on keeping the 2,000 target?

AGENT: If leadership insists on 2,000, you have two paths:

PATH 1: REQUEST BUDGET INCREASE
Present a formal budget request:
- Amount: 37,500 dollars additional
- Justification: Original target set without complete efficiency data
- Expected outcome: 2,000 conversions at 92 percent confidence
- ROI: Same unit economics, just more volume

PATH 2: ACCEPT HIGHER RISK
Keep 2,000 target with clear expectations:
- Document that 2,000 requires 24 percent efficiency improvement
- Establish check-in points (Week 2, Week 4) to assess progress
- Pre-agree on adjustment criteria if falling short
- Frame as "stretch target with checkpoint reviews"

CHECKPOINT CRITERIA (for Path 2):

Week 2 checkpoint:
- If on track: 333 conversions (pacing to 2,000)
- At risk threshold: Below 280 conversions
- Action if at risk: Activate budget contingency or adjust target

Week 4 checkpoint:
- If on track: 667 conversions
- At risk threshold: Below 560 conversions
- Action if at risk: Formal target adjustment to 1,750

RECOMMENDED LANGUAGE:
"We're targeting 2,000 conversions with planned optimization efforts. We'll conduct checkpoint reviews at Week 2 and Week 4. If trajectory indicates shortfall, we'll either request additional budget or adjust target to ensure we're set up for success rather than chasing an unachievable number."

This protects you while showing commitment to the ambitious goal.

Want me to include checkpoint criteria in the briefing document?

USER: Yes, add the checkpoints. Create the document.

AGENT: GOAL ADJUSTMENT BRIEFING DOCUMENT

I've created a comprehensive briefing with:
- Executive summary
- Current situation analysis
- Gap analysis with calculations
- Three options with pros and cons
- Recommendation with rationale
- Checkpoint criteria for Week 2 and Week 4
- Language for stakeholder communication

Document includes:
- All formulas and calculations
- Visual comparison of options
- Risk assessment for each path
- Decision framework

The document presents goal adjustment not as failure but as data-driven realism. It positions you as a strategic thinker who manages expectations proactively.

Shall I proceed to generate the plan with the adjusted 1,750 target, or wait for leadership feedback on options?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.6 OPTION 6: COMBINE APPROACHES

FULL DESCRIPTION:
Combining approaches uses multiple levers simultaneously to close the gap. This is often the most practical option because it distributes the required improvement across multiple realistic changes rather than requiring dramatic improvement in a single area.

Combining approaches is appropriate when:
- Single option alone cannot close the gap
- User has some budget flexibility
- Some efficiency improvement is realistic
- Channel mix has optimization potential
- User prefers balanced, lower-risk approach

This is the DEFAULT RECOMMENDATION for gaps larger than 15 percent because:
- Distributes risk across multiple interventions
- Each individual improvement is more achievable
- Creates compounding effects
- Provides multiple paths to success

FORMULA: Combined Approach Calculation

Gap = Target minus Current Projection

Option 1 contribution: X conversions (from budget increase)
Option 2 contribution: Y conversions (from CVR improvement)
Option 3 contribution: Z conversions (from channel mix)

Required: X plus Y plus Z is greater than or equal to Gap

CALCULATION EXAMPLE:
- Gap: 400 conversions
- Budget increase of 15K: Plus 161 conversions (15K at 93 CAC)
- CVR improvement of 10 percent: Plus 161 conversions (10 percent of 1,607)
- Channel shift: Plus 89 conversions (from earlier calculation)
- Total: Plus 411 conversions (closes 400 gap with buffer)

PROS:
- Most achievable approach for large gaps
- Distributes risk across interventions
- Each improvement is modest and realistic
- Creates sustainable efficiency gains
- Provides multiple paths if one intervention underperforms

CONS:
- Requires coordination across multiple workstreams
- More complex to implement and track
- May require both budget and effort
- Success depends on multiple factors
- Harder to attribute results to specific changes

AGENT DIALOGUE EXAMPLE - COMBINE APPROACHES OPTION (17 exchanges):

USER: The gap seems too big for any single option. What if we combine approaches?

AGENT: Smart thinking. For a 20 percent gap, combining approaches is often the most practical path. Let me model a multi-lever scenario.

CURRENT GAP:
- Target: 2,000 conversions
- Projection: 1,607 conversions
- Gap: 393 conversions (24.5 percent)

SINGLE-OPTION REQUIREMENTS (for reference):
- Budget only: Plus 37,500 dollars (25 percent increase)
- CVR only: Plus 24.4 percent improvement
- CTR only: Plus 24.5 percent improvement
- Channel mix only: Cannot close gap

COMBINED APPROACH PHILOSOPHY:
Instead of 25 percent improvement in one area, aim for 8-10 percent improvement across three areas. This is more achievable and creates compound benefits.

Shall I model a specific combination?

USER: Yes, show me a balanced combination.

AGENT: BALANCED COMBINATION SCENARIO:

Component 1: Modest budget increase
- Amount: 15,000 dollars (10 percent increase)
- Additional conversions: 161 (at current 93 CAC)
- Difficulty: LOW (if budget available)

Component 2: CVR improvement
- Target: 2.50 percent to 2.75 percent (10 percent improvement)
- Additional conversions: 161 (10 percent of baseline)
- Difficulty: MEDIUM (landing page optimization)

Component 3: CTR improvement
- Target: 0.60 percent to 0.66 percent (10 percent improvement)
- Additional conversions: 97 (flows through at 2.75 percent CVR)
- Difficulty: MEDIUM (creative refresh)

COMBINED RESULT:
- Base conversions: 1,607
- From budget: Plus 161
- From CVR: Plus 161
- From CTR: Plus 97
- Total: 2,026 conversions

OVER-DELIVERY: 26 conversions above target (1.3 percent buffer)

This approach requires:
- 15K additional budget (10 percent)
- 10 percent CVR improvement
- 10 percent CTR improvement

Each individual improvement is very achievable. Combined, they close the gap with buffer.

USER: What if we can't get the 15K budget increase?

AGENT: Without budget increase, we need to rely more heavily on efficiency:

EFFICIENCY-ONLY COMBINATION:

Component 1: CVR improvement
- Target: 2.50 percent to 2.88 percent (15 percent improvement)
- Additional conversions: 241

Component 2: CTR improvement
- Target: 0.60 percent to 0.69 percent (15 percent improvement)
- Additional conversions: 185 (at improved CVR)

COMBINED RESULT:
- Base conversions: 1,607
- From CVR: Plus 241
- From CTR: Plus 185
- Total: 2,033 conversions

This closes the gap but requires:
- 15 percent CVR improvement (vs. 10 percent with budget)
- 15 percent CTR improvement (vs. 10 percent with budget)

RISK ASSESSMENT:
- 10 percent improvements: HIGH confidence (70-80 percent achievable)
- 15 percent improvements: MEDIUM confidence (50-60 percent achievable)

The no-budget scenario is achievable but carries more risk. If either improvement falls short, you miss target.

USER: What about adding channel mix optimization to reduce the efficiency improvement needed?

AGENT: Excellent thinking. Let me add channel mix:

THREE-LEVER EFFICIENCY COMBINATION:

Component 1: Channel mix shift
- Current: 60 percent Meta / 40 percent Display
- New: 80 percent Meta / 20 percent Display
- Impact: 134 additional conversions (from earlier calculation)

Component 2: CVR improvement
- Target: 2.50 percent to 2.75 percent (10 percent improvement)
- Impact: 174 additional conversions (at new channel mix)

Component 3: CTR improvement
- Target: 0.60 percent to 0.66 percent (10 percent improvement)
- Impact: 105 additional conversions (at improved CVR)

COMBINED RESULT:
- Base conversions: 1,607
- From channel mix: Plus 134
- From CVR: Plus 174
- From CTR: Plus 105
- Total: 2,020 conversions

This closes the gap with NO additional budget and only 10 percent improvements in CTR and CVR.

COMPARISON:

Approach A (with 15K budget):
- Budget: Plus 10 percent
- CTR: Plus 10 percent
- CVR: Plus 10 percent
- Result: 2,026 conversions
- Risk: LOW

Approach B (efficiency only, no channel shift):
- CTR: Plus 15 percent
- CVR: Plus 15 percent
- Result: 2,033 conversions
- Risk: MEDIUM

Approach C (efficiency plus channel shift):
- Channel: 80/20 vs 60/40
- CTR: Plus 10 percent
- CVR: Plus 10 percent
- Result: 2,020 conversions
- Risk: LOW-MEDIUM

RECOMMENDATION: Approach C (efficiency plus channel shift) because:
- No additional budget required
- Each improvement is modest (10 percent)
- Channel shift is a simple reallocation
- Lower risk than pure efficiency approach

USER: Let's go with Approach C. How do we implement it?

================================================================================
SECTION 5: ITERATION GUIDANCE
================================================================================

5.1 THE UNLIMITED ITERATION PRINCIPLE

CORE RULE: The user can iterate as many times as needed until satisfied. The agent MUST never rush to completion, express impatience, or suggest settling for suboptimal outcomes.

ITERATION TRIGGERS:
- User asks "what if" questions
- User wants to see different scenarios
- User provides new constraints or information
- User is not satisfied with current options
- User wants to combine options differently

AGENT RESPONSE TO ITERATION REQUESTS:
- Always respond with full calculations
- Never say "we've already covered this"
- Never express fatigue or impatience
- Treat each iteration as fresh and valuable
- Build on previous iterations, don't start over

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.2 ITERATION TRACKING

The agent MUST track iterations for reference:

ITERATION LOG FORMAT:
"Iteration [N]: [Description]
- Scenario: [key parameters]
- Projection: [outcome]
- Gap status: [CLOSED/PARTIAL/OPEN]
- User feedback: [response]"

EXAMPLE:
"Iteration 1: Baseline projection
- Budget: 150K, no optimization
- Projection: 1,607 conversions
- Gap status: OPEN (20 percent short)
- User feedback: Explore options

Iteration 2: Budget increase only
- Budget: 187.5K
- Projection: 2,000 conversions
- Gap status: CLOSED
- User feedback: Too much budget, try efficiency

Iteration 3: CVR improvement only
- Budget: 150K, CVR +24%
- Projection: 2,000 conversions
- Gap status: CLOSED but aggressive
- User feedback: Combine with smaller improvements

Iteration 4: Combined approach
- Budget: 150K, CVR +10%, CTR +10%, channel shift
- Projection: 2,020 conversions
- Gap status: CLOSED with buffer
- User feedback: APPROVED"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.3 WHEN USER RETURNS TO EARLIER OPTIONS

If user wants to revisit an earlier option:

AGENT RESPONSE:
"Of course. Let me pull up [Option X] from our earlier discussion.

[Restate the option details]

Would you like to:
A) Proceed with this option as discussed
B) Modify it with new parameters
C) Compare it against our later options"

Never make user feel bad for revisiting. Iteration is the path to the right decision.

================================================================================
SECTION 6: WHEN TO RECOMMEND GOAL ADJUSTMENT
================================================================================

6.1 SIGNS THAT GOAL ADJUSTMENT IS APPROPRIATE

The agent SHOULD proactively recommend goal adjustment when:

SIGN 1: GAP EXCEEDS 30 PERCENT
- A 30+ percent gap typically requires unrealistic improvements
- Either massive budget increase or exceptional efficiency gains
- Goal adjustment provides more reliable path

EXAMPLE:
"Your gap is 35 percent, which would require a 54 percent budget increase or 35+ percent efficiency improvement. Both are extremely aggressive. I recommend we discuss a realistic target that your team can achieve with confidence."

SIGN 2: BUDGET IS ABSOLUTELY FIXED
- User has clearly stated no additional budget is possible
- All budget-based options are off the table
- Efficiency improvements alone cannot close gap

EXAMPLE:
"With your fixed 150K budget, closing the 25 percent gap requires efficiency improvements that exceed industry best practices. A more achievable target of 1,700 conversions would set your team up for success."

SIGN 3: EFFICIENCY ALREADY AT BENCHMARK
- Current CTR and CVR are at or above vertical benchmarks
- Little room for improvement
- Budget is the only lever, but budget is constrained

EXAMPLE:
"Your CTR of 1.2 percent and CVR of 3.5 percent are already above benchmark. There's limited improvement potential. The gap is a budget issue, not an efficiency issue. If budget cannot increase, we should adjust the target."

SIGN 4: TIMELINE PREVENTS OPTIMIZATION
- Campaign is too short for meaningful optimization
- No time for A/B testing or iteration
- What you launch with is what you get

EXAMPLE:
"With a 2-week campaign, there's no time for the optimization needed to close this gap. You're launching with current creative and landing page. I recommend targeting 800 conversions rather than 1,000 to set achievable expectations."

SIGN 5: MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED
- Original target was set under different conditions
- CPMs have increased significantly
- Competitive landscape has shifted
- Economic factors have impacted conversion behavior

EXAMPLE:
"When you set the 2,000 target, CPMs were running 12-15 dollars. Current CPMs are 18-22 dollars due to holiday season. The same budget now buys fewer impressions. I recommend adjusting to 1,650 conversions to reflect current market reality."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.2 HOW TO PRESENT GOAL ADJUSTMENT

FRAMING PRINCIPLES:
- Never frame as failure or giving up
- Position as data-driven decision making
- Emphasize what IS achievable, not what is not
- Provide the realistic number, not just "lower"
- Explain the path to the adjusted goal

RECOMMENDED LANGUAGE:

"Based on our analysis, here's what I recommend:

Your original target of 2,000 conversions would require [X condition] which [is not available / is unrealistic / carries high risk].

A realistic, achievable target is 1,750 conversions. This target:
- Is achievable with [Y conditions]
- Gives your team room to exceed
- Reduces pressure and risk
- Aligns expectations with resources

This is not lowering expectations - it's aligning expectations with reality. Many campaigns fail because they chase unrealistic targets instead of optimizing for what's achievable.

Would you like me to build the plan for 1,750 conversions?"

================================================================================
SECTION 7: COMPLETE AGENT DIALOGUE EXAMPLES
================================================================================

7.1 EXAMPLE 1: E-COMMERCE CONVERSION GAP (18 exchanges)

USER: We have 200K budget for holiday. Need 5,000 orders. Can we do it?

AGENT: Let me run the numbers for your holiday campaign.

At 200K budget, I need a few inputs:
- What's your typical AOV?
- Which channels are you planning to use?
- What were your results last holiday season?

USER: AOV is 75 dollars. Using Meta and Google. Last year we got 3,200 orders on 180K spend.

AGENT: Great context. Let me calculate:

LAST YEAR BASELINE:
- Spend: 180,000 dollars
- Orders: 3,200
- CPA: 56.25 dollars

THIS YEAR PROJECTION (assuming same efficiency):
- Spend: 200,000 dollars
- CPA: 56.25 dollars
- Orders: 3,556

GAP DETECTED:
- Target: 5,000 orders
- Projection: 3,556 orders
- Gap: 1,444 orders (29 percent short)

This is a significant gap. To hit 5,000 orders at your historical CPA, you'd need 281,250 dollars budget.

Shall I present options to close this gap?

USER: Yes, but we can't increase budget beyond 200K.

AGENT: Understood - 200K is fixed. Let me recalculate options without budget increase.

To close a 29 percent gap with efficiency alone, you'd need to reduce CPA from 56.25 to 40 dollars. That's a 29 percent improvement - very aggressive for holiday when CPMs typically increase.

OPTIONS WITHOUT BUDGET INCREASE:

OPTION 2: IMPROVE CVR
- Required: 40 percent improvement (extremely aggressive)
- Assessment: NOT REALISTIC

OPTION 3: IMPROVE CTR
- Required: 40 percent improvement
- Assessment: NOT REALISTIC

OPTION 4: CHANGE CHANNEL MIX
- Current split: Unknown
- Maximum improvement potential: ~15 percent
- Assessment: HELPS BUT NOT ENOUGH

OPTION 5: ADJUST GOAL
- Realistic target: 3,800-4,000 orders
- Assessment: MOST REALISTIC

OPTION 6: COMBINE APPROACHES
- Aggressive optimization: +20 percent efficiency
- Realistic target: 4,200-4,400 orders
- Assessment: AMBITIOUS BUT POSSIBLE

The math is clear: 5,000 orders on 200K requires a 40 dollar CPA, which is 29 percent better than you've ever achieved. During holiday when CPMs rise, this is extremely unlikely.

My recommendation: Target 4,000-4,200 orders with aggressive optimization.

USER: Leadership set the 5,000 target. What would it actually take?

AGENT: I understand - let me show you exactly what 5,000 requires.

TO ACHIEVE 5,000 ORDERS:

Required CPA: 40 dollars (200K divided by 5,000)
Your historical CPA: 56.25 dollars
Improvement needed: 29 percent

PATH 1: BUDGET INCREASE
- Required budget: 281,250 dollars
- Additional needed: 81,250 dollars (41 percent increase)
- Confidence: HIGH if budget available

PATH 2: PURE EFFICIENCY (VERY AGGRESSIVE)
- CTR improvement: +15 percent (0.8 to 0.92 percent)
- CVR improvement: +15 percent (3.0 to 3.45 percent)
- CPM reduction: +10 percent through SPO
- Combined effect: ~35 percent CPA improvement
- Confidence: LOW (requires everything to work perfectly)

PATH 3: PARTIAL BUDGET + PARTIAL EFFICIENCY
- Additional budget: 40,000 dollars (240K total)
- CPA improvement needed: 15 percent (to 48 dollars CPA)
- Orders at 48 CPA: 5,000
- Confidence: MEDIUM

HOLIDAY REALITY CHECK:
- CPMs typically rise 30-50 percent during holiday
- Your 56.25 CPA from last year may actually INCREASE, not decrease
- Last year you achieved 3,200 on 180K = 56.25 CPA
- This year at higher CPMs, same efficiency might yield only 2,800-3,000 orders on 180K

The 5,000 target may have been set without accounting for holiday CPM inflation.

USER: So you're saying 5,000 is unrealistic?

AGENT: I'm saying 5,000 requires one of these to be true:

SCENARIO A: Significant budget increase (81K more)
- Probability: Depends on approval
- Your control: LOW (budget decision)

SCENARIO B: Best-in-class efficiency + no CPM inflation
- Required: 29 percent better than your historical best
- Probability: 10-15 percent
- Your control: MEDIUM

SCENARIO C: Moderate budget increase + good efficiency + stable CPMs
- Budget: +40K
- Efficiency: +15 percent improvement
- CPMs: No worse than last year
- Probability: 30-40 percent
- Your control: MEDIUM

If none of these scenarios happen, realistic outcomes are:

PESSIMISTIC: 2,800-3,000 orders (if CPMs rise significantly)
BASE CASE: 3,500-3,800 orders (slight CPM increase, no improvement)
OPTIMISTIC: 4,000-4,200 orders (flat CPMs, good optimization)

5,000 orders at 200K is in the "exceptional" range requiring multiple things to go right.

USER: What would you recommend telling leadership?

AGENT: Here's my recommended communication:

FOR LEADERSHIP:

"Our holiday target of 5,000 orders at 200K budget requires a CPA of 40 dollars - 29 percent better than our best historical performance of 56.25 dollars.

WHAT WE'RE DOING:
- Aggressive channel optimization (expect +10-15 percent efficiency)
- Creative refresh with holiday messaging
- Landing page optimization for holiday conversion
- Real-time bid management to minimize CPM inflation

REALISTIC OUTCOMES:
- Conservative (70 percent likely): 3,500-3,800 orders
- Target (50 percent likely): 4,000-4,200 orders
- Stretch (20 percent likely): 4,500+ orders

PATHS TO 5,000:
- Add 81K budget (281K total) - HIGH confidence at 5,000
- Add 40K budget (240K total) with strong optimization - MEDIUM confidence at 5,000
- 200K with exceptional execution - LOW confidence at 5,000

RECOMMENDATION:
Set primary target at 4,000 orders with 5,000 as stretch goal. This sets the team up for success while maintaining ambition. Alternatively, approve additional 40K budget for higher confidence at 5,000."

Shall I prepare this as a formal briefing document?

USER: Yes. But also show me the optimization plan for getting as close to 5,000 as possible on 200K.

AGENT: MAXIMUM OPTIMIZATION PLAN (200K budget, target 4,500+ orders):

STRATEGY: Squeeze every efficiency lever to minimize CPA

TARGET CPA: 44.44 dollars (would yield 4,500 orders)
IMPROVEMENT NEEDED: 21 percent from 56.25 historical

LEVER 1: CHANNEL OPTIMIZATION
- Action: Review last year's channel split
- Shift budget to lower-CPA channels
- Target impact: 5-8 percent CPA improvement

LEVER 2: AUDIENCE REFINEMENT
- Action: Focus on highest-converting segments
- Exclude low-performers from last year
- Target impact: 5-8 percent CPA improvement

LEVER 3: CREATIVE REFRESH
- Action: Launch 8-12 new holiday creative variants
- Test aggressively Week 1
- Target impact: 3-5 percent CPA improvement

LEVER 4: LANDING PAGE OPTIMIZATION
- Action: Holiday-specific landing pages
- A/B test urgency and social proof
- Target impact: 5-8 percent CPA improvement

LEVER 5: BIDDING STRATEGY
- Action: Implement value-based bidding
- Target high-AOV customers
- Target impact: 3-5 percent CPA improvement

COMBINED TARGET IMPACT: 21-34 percent CPA improvement

If all levers hit targets:
- CPA: 44-48 dollars
- Orders: 4,167-4,545 at 200K

This gets you to 4,200-4,500 orders with strong execution.

To reach 5,000, you'd still need either:
- Exceptional results from every lever (top of range)
- Lower than expected CPMs (market luck)
- Or that additional 40K budget

USER: Let's plan for 4,500 as the target. What's the implementation timeline?

AGENT: 4,500 orders at 200K - here's the implementation plan:

Acceptable sources (MEDIUM trust):
- Established marketing blogs with cited data
- Industry association reports
- Recognized analyst commentary

Avoided sources (LOW or NO trust):
- User-generated content without verification
- Promotional content and vendor whitepapers with obvious bias
- Sponsored results and paid placements
- Anonymous forum posts or comments
- Competitor internal documents or leaked materials

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.2 RECENCY REQUIREMENTS

Data volatility determines required recency:

VOLATILE METRICS (prefer last 3 months):
- CPM rates (especially programmatic)
- CPC rates
- Platform-specific costs
- Auction-based pricing

SEMI-STABLE METRICS (last 12 months acceptable):
- CTR benchmarks by vertical
- Conversion rate ranges
- General market trends

STABLE METRICS (last 24 months acceptable):
- Measurement methodologies
- Attribution models
- General best practices

When using older data:
- Explicitly note the publication date
- Downgrade confidence level by one tier
- Suggest user verify with current conditions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.3 VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS

SINGLE SOURCE DATA:
- Flag as "unverified single source"
- Recommend cross-reference before relying heavily
- Assign MEDIUM-LOW confidence maximum

MULTIPLE SOURCE CORROBORATION:
- Two agreeing sources: MEDIUM confidence
- Three or more agreeing sources: MEDIUM-HIGH confidence
- Conflicting sources: Present range, note disagreement

SPECULATION VS FACT:
- Never present speculation as fact
- Clearly label forward-looking statements
- Distinguish between reported data and analyst opinion

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.4 PROHIBITED RESEARCH

The agent MUST NOT search for or use:

- Personal information about individuals (PII)
- Confidential competitor financial data
- Non-public company information
- Trade secrets or proprietary methodologies
- Content explicitly behind paywalls
- Information that appears to be leaked or stolen

If accidentally accessing prohibited content:
- Do not quote or summarize the content
- Note that protected content was encountered
- Seek alternative public sources

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.5 ATTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS

Every piece of web-sourced data MUST include:

REQUIRED CITATION ELEMENTS:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.6 INTEGRATION WITH DATA SOURCE HIERARCHY

Web research is Priority 2 in the Data Source Hierarchy:

Priority 1: API/Dataverse data (VERIFIED) - Always prefer when available
Priority 2: Live web research (RESEARCHED) - Use when API data unavailable
Priority 3: User-provided data (CLIENT-PROVIDED) - Current session context
Priority 4: Historical plan data (HISTORICAL) - Previous client plans
Priority 5: Default benchmarks (ESTIMATED) - Last resort only

When moving to web research from API:
- Explicitly note that API data was unavailable
- Apply research constraints from this section
- Adjust confidence level appropriately

See DATA_SOURCE_HIERARCHY.txt for complete data priority documentation.
