MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK v5.5

================================================================================
VERSION INFORMATION
================================================================================

VERSION: 5.5
DATE: January 2026
STATUS: Production Ready
COMPLIANCE: 6-Rule Compliant
PURPOSE: Measurement strategy, attribution model selection, conversion tracking

================================================================================
OVERVIEW
================================================================================

This document provides systematic guidance for measurement strategy, attribution model selection, conversion tracking, and performance evaluation across campaign types. The agent should use this framework to recommend appropriate measurement approaches while adapting to user data availability and organizational maturity.

================================================================================
FALLBACK BEHAVIOR
================================================================================

If this document does not contain relevant guidance for a specific measurement scenario:
- Research current best practices using available tools
- Apply general measurement principles to novel situations
- Clearly state when recommendations are based on general principles versus documented guidance
- Never fail or error due to missing information - adapt and inform the user

If user measurement approaches conflict with best practices in this document:
- Present the recommended approach with rationale
- Acknowledge organizational constraints or legacy systems
- Proceed with user direction if they confirm after seeing the recommendation
- Do not repeatedly challenge user decisions after initial guidance

================================================================================
MEASUREMENT PHILOSOPHY
================================================================================

Measurement exists to inform decisions, not to prove success. The goal is accurate understanding of marketing impact, not favorable reporting. Honest measurement enables optimization. Biased measurement enables waste.

================================================================================
THE MEASUREMENT TRINITY
================================================================================

Modern measurement requires three complementary approaches working together:

MARKETING MIX MODELING (MMM)
- Top-down statistical analysis using aggregate data
- Measures impact of all channels including offline
- Accounts for external factors (seasonality, economy, competition)
- Strategic planning timeframe (quarterly, annually)
- Privacy-safe (no user-level tracking required)
- Best for: Budget allocation decisions, channel mix optimization, long-term planning

MULTI-TOUCH ATTRIBUTION (MTA)
- Bottom-up analysis using user-level journey data
- Assigns credit to digital touchpoints
- Near real-time optimization insights
- Tactical execution timeframe (daily, weekly)
- Requires user-level tracking (privacy challenged)
- Best for: In-flight optimization, creative testing, tactical decisions

INCREMENTALITY TESTING
- Controlled experiments measuring true causal impact
- Holdout groups establish baseline
- Isolates marketing effect from organic demand
- Campaign or test timeframe
- Gold standard for proving causation
- Best for: Validating channel value, major budget decisions, new channel evaluation

TRIANGULATION PRINCIPLE

No single measurement approach provides complete truth. Triangulate findings across methods:
- If MMM and MTA agree: High confidence in finding
- If MMM and incrementality agree: Strong evidence for strategic decision
- If MTA and incrementality disagree: Investigate attribution model assumptions
- If all three disagree: Examine data quality and methodology

================================================================================
ATTRIBUTION MODEL SELECTION
================================================================================

SINGLE-TOUCH MODELS

First-Touch Attribution
- Assigns 100 percent credit to first interaction
- Best for: Understanding awareness channel effectiveness
- Weakness: Ignores conversion drivers
- Use when: Evaluating top-of-funnel campaigns, simple acquisition funnels

Last-Touch Attribution
- Assigns 100 percent credit to final interaction before conversion
- Best for: Understanding immediate conversion triggers
- Weakness: Ignores awareness and consideration drivers
- Use when: Short purchase cycles, direct response campaigns, limited data

Last Non-Direct Click
- Assigns credit to last marketing touchpoint (excludes direct)
- Best for: Understanding which marketing drove conversion
- Weakness: Still ignores earlier touchpoints
- Use when: Default in many platforms, acceptable starting point

MULTI-TOUCH MODELS

Linear Attribution
- Distributes credit equally across all touchpoints
- Best for: Acknowledging full journey contribution
- Weakness: No differentiation by touchpoint value
- Use when: Long consideration cycles, B2B with many touchpoints

Time-Decay Attribution
- Weights touchpoints closer to conversion more heavily
- Best for: Recognizing recency importance
- Weakness: May undervalue awareness
- Use when: Moderate sales cycles, consideration-heavy purchases

Position-Based (U-Shaped)
- 40 percent to first touch, 40 percent to last touch, 20 percent distributed middle
- Best for: Valuing both awareness and conversion
- Weakness: Arbitrary weighting
- Use when: Balanced full-funnel campaigns

W-Shaped Attribution
- Credit to first touch, lead creation, and opportunity creation
- Best for: B2B with defined funnel stages
- Weakness: Requires clear stage definitions
- Use when: B2B campaigns with CRM integration

Data-Driven (Algorithmic)
- Machine learning assigns credit based on conversion probability impact
- Best for: Large datasets with sufficient conversion volume
- Weakness: Requires substantial data, black box methodology
- Use when: High conversion volume, sophisticated measurement needs

ATTRIBUTION MODEL SELECTION BY CAMPAIGN TYPE

AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS
- Primary Model: First-Touch
- Supporting: Linear (to see full journey)
- Rationale: Awareness channels rarely get last-touch credit despite driving demand
- Key Consideration: Use brand lift studies alongside attribution

CONSIDERATION CAMPAIGNS
- Primary Model: Linear or Time-Decay
- Supporting: Position-Based
- Rationale: Middle funnel deserves proportional credit
- Key Consideration: Define consideration actions clearly (content consumption, site engagement)

CONVERSION CAMPAIGNS
- Primary Model: Last-Touch or Time-Decay
- Supporting: Data-Driven if volume supports
- Rationale: Focus on conversion efficiency
- Key Consideration: Ensure proper conversion tracking across all touchpoints

FULL-FUNNEL CAMPAIGNS
- Primary Model: Position-Based or Data-Driven
- Supporting: View across all models for different insights
- Rationale: Need to value both awareness and conversion
- Key Consideration: Align attribution model with budget allocation philosophy

B2B LONG-CYCLE CAMPAIGNS
- Primary Model: W-Shaped or Custom multi-touch
- Supporting: Account-level attribution
- Rationale: Long cycles with multiple stakeholders need full journey view
- Key Consideration: Integrate CRM data with marketing touchpoints

CONVERSION TRACKING BEST PRACTICES

- Conversion lift (platform-run experiments)
- Matched market tests

TEST DESIGN PRINCIPLES

Statistical Power:
- Ensure sufficient sample size for detection
- Define minimum detectable effect in advance
- Run for adequate duration

- CTV/Video: 40-60 percent incremental

WHEN TO DEVIATE FROM RECOMMENDATIONS

User context overrides framework guidance when:
- Organizational measurement maturity differs from recommendation
- Data availability limits implementation options
- Industry-specific requirements apply
- User has validated alternative approaches

Agent response to deviation requests:
- Present recommended approach with rationale
- Acknowledge practical constraints
- Proceed with user direction
- Suggest improvement path for future

SUMMARY

Measurement strategy should match campaign objectives and organizational maturity. Use the measurement trinity (MMM, MTA, Incrementality) for comprehensive understanding. Select attribution models based on campaign type and sales cycle. Implement privacy-first tracking for future-proof measurement. Triangulate findings across methods for confidence. When guidance is missing, apply general principles and research current practices. Adapt to user context while sharing best practices.
