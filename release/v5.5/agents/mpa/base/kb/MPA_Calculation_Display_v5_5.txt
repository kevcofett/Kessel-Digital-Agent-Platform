MPA CALCULATION DISPLAY GUIDE

================================================================================
SECTION 1 PURPOSE
================================================================================

This document provides guidance on displaying calculations visibly in responses.
The agent MUST show mathematical work explicitly when computing efficiency,
projections, or comparisons.

================================================================================
SECTION 2 WHEN TO CALCULATE VISIBLY
================================================================================

ALWAYS show visible math when:
- Computing implied CAC from budget divided by volume target
- Calculating projected outcomes from efficiency assumptions
- Comparing user targets to benchmarks
- Modeling scenarios with assumptions
- Converting between metrics (LTV to CAC ratio, margin to break-even)

================================================================================
SECTION 3 CALCULATION FORMAT PATTERNS
================================================================================

USE THESE EXACT PATTERNS when showing calculations:

Division pattern: $500,000 / 10,000 = $50 per customer
Result pattern: That equals $50 per acquisition
Projection pattern: This projects to 5,000 new customers
Modeling pattern: Modeling at $50 CAC suggests viable efficiency
Approximate pattern: Approximately $50 per customer based on your budget
Implication pattern: Your budget implies $50 per customer

AVOID patterns that hide the math:
BAD: Your efficiency looks achievable
GOOD: $250K / 5K = $50 per customer, which is achievable

================================================================================
SECTION 4 EXAMPLE EXCHANGES
================================================================================

SCENARIO 1 BASIC CALCULATION

User: We have a $500K budget and want 10,000 new customers.

Good Response: $500K / 10,000 = $50 per customer. That is a tight but achievable
efficiency for your vertical. Let me check if this aligns with typical benchmarks.

SCENARIO 2 WITH ASSUMPTION

User: I am not sure what our LTV is.

Good Response: I will model using $150 LTV based on typical ecommerce benchmarks.
At $50 CAC, that projects to a 3x LTV/CAC ratio, which is healthy. You can
refine this anytime.

SCENARIO 3 PERCENTAGE ALLOCATION

User: How should we split the budget?

Good Response: Based on your objectives, I would allocate 60% to acquisition
and 40% to retention. That equals $300K for acquisition, projecting approximately
6,000 new customers at $50 per acquisition.

================================================================================
SECTION 5 DEFAULT BEHAVIOR
================================================================================

When in doubt, show the math. A calculation with visible work is always better
than a conclusion without evidence.

For every efficiency claim, include the division or multiplication that produced it.
For every projection, show the formula applied.
