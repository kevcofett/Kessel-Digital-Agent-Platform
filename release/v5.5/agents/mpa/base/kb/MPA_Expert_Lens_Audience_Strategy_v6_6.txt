MPA EXPERT LENS: AUDIENCE STRATEGY v6.6

PURPOSE

This document provides expert-level guidance for audience definition with v6.6 mandatory response patterns and full ADIS model integration. Use this document for Steps 3-4 Audience and Geography.

V6.6 AUDIENCE RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS

Every audience discussion MUST include:

1. CONTEXT CALLBACK: Reference objective and vertical
2. FOUR DIMENSIONS: Verify demographic, behavioral, contextual, geographic
3. SIGNAL COUNT: Match rigor to campaign type
4. KB BENCHMARK: Cite audience size benchmarks
5. ADIS OFFER: Proactively offer customer data analysis

AUDIENCE DEFINITION PATTERN

When defining audience:

STEP 1: Reference context
For your [objective] campaign in [vertical]...

STEP 2: Check four dimensions
Let me verify we have all four dimensions:
- Demographic: [status]
- Behavioral: [status]
- Contextual: [status]
- Geographic: [status]

STEP 3: Assess signal count
For [campaign type], I recommend [X-Y] targeting signals. We currently have [Z].

STEP 4: Offer ADIS
Do you have customer transaction data? ADIS can identify your best customer segments and create lookalike profiles.

FOUR DIMENSION REQUIREMENTS

DIMENSION 1: DEMOGRAPHIC
Required signals:
- Age range with specific bounds
- Gender if relevant
- Household income tier
- Education level if relevant
- Homeownership status if relevant
- Presence of children if relevant
- Life stage indicators

Example: Adults 25-54, HHI 75K+, homeowners, no children

DIMENSION 2: BEHAVIORAL
Required signals:
- In-market purchase intent
- Content consumption patterns
- Past purchase history
- Site visitation behavior
- App usage patterns
- Search behavior
- Engagement patterns

Example: In-market for fitness equipment, gym membership, health app users

DIMENSION 3: CONTEXTUAL
Required signals:
- Daypart targeting
- Device targeting
- Content category alignment
- Weather triggers if applicable
- Seasonal patterns
- Event triggers

Example: Mobile-first, fitness content environments, morning/evening commute

DIMENSION 4: GEOGRAPHIC
Required signals:
- Country or countries
- Region or state level
- DMA or market level
- Urban versus suburban versus rural
- Language preferences

Example: US, top 15 DMAs, suburban and urban

SIGNAL COUNT THRESHOLDS

Based on KB data, recommended signal counts by campaign type:

BRAND AWARENESS: 5-10 signals
- Broader targeting acceptable
- Prioritize reach over precision
- Demographic and geographic focus

CONSIDERATION: 10-20 signals
- Moderate precision
- Add behavioral signals
- Balance reach and relevance

PERFORMANCE/ACQUISITION: 20-40 signals
- High precision required
- Heavy behavioral targeting
- Detailed contextual signals

RETENTION/LOYALTY: 15-30 signals
- Known customer data available
- ADIS segment-based targeting
- Personalization signals

ADIS AUDIENCE INTEGRATION

ALL EIGHT MODELS create audiences. Use the appropriate model:

RFM SEGMENTATION
Creates: Behavioral segments (Champions, Loyal, At Risk, etc.)
Use for: Retention, reactivation, lifecycle campaigns
Audience application: Target each segment with tailored messaging

DECILE ANALYSIS
Creates: Value-based tiers (Decile 1-10)
Use for: Budget prioritization, lookalike seeding
Audience application: Weight spend toward high-value deciles

COHORT ANALYSIS
Creates: Temporal segments (by acquisition period)
Use for: Lifecycle stage targeting, retention analysis
Audience application: Adjust messaging by customer maturity

DETERMINISTIC CLV
Creates: Predicted value segments
Use for: Budget allocation, high-value targeting
Audience application: Prioritize high-LTV customers for premium channels

PROBABILISTIC CLV (BG-NBD)
Creates: Predicted value with probability-alive scores
Use for: Reactivation targeting, churn prevention
Audience application: Target low prob-alive but high historical value

K-MEANS CLUSTERING
Creates: Natural groupings based on chosen features
Use for: Audience discovery, creative segmentation
Audience application: Discover segments you did not know existed

PROPENSITY MODEL
Creates: Likelihood scores for specific behaviors
Use for: Precision targeting, lookalike optimization
Audience application: Concentrate spend on high-propensity customers

UPLIFT MODEL
Creates: Incremental response scores
Use for: Incrementality optimization, test prioritization
Audience application: Target customers who respond BECAUSE of marketing

ADIS AUDIENCE PROMPTS BY STEP

STEP 3 INITIAL:
Do you have customer transaction data? I can run ADIS analysis to:
- Identify your Champions, Loyal Customers, and At Risk segments
- Calculate customer lifetime value for budget prioritization
- Discover natural customer clusters for creative development
- Build propensity scores for precision targeting

STEP 3 WITH DATA:
Your ADIS analysis identified [X] segments across [Y] customers. For your [objective] campaign:

Champions ([Z] customers, [%] of value):
Targeting approach: Retention, upsell, referral programs
Channels: Email, direct mail, loyalty programs

At Risk ([Z] customers, [%] of value):
Targeting approach: Win-back, reactivation offers
Channels: Retargeting, email win-back

New Acquisition:
Targeting approach: Lookalike from Champions profile
Channels: Paid social, search prospecting

STEP 4 GEOGRAPHY WITH ADIS:
With your ADIS segments defined, I can size audiences by geography. Your Champions index highest in [DMAs]. Your At Risk concentration is heaviest in [DMAs]. Want me to build the geography-segment matrix?

AUDIENCE SIZING REQUIREMENTS

All audience estimates MUST include:

1. THE NUMBER: Estimated addressable audience
2. THE CALCULATION: How you arrived at it
3. THE SOURCE: Where base data comes from

EXAMPLE:
Based on KB data for ecommerce fitness, serious athletes represent 2-4% of the fitness population. For adults 25-54 nationally at roughly 120M, that gives 2.4-4.8M fitness enthusiasts. Narrowing to your income and geographic criteria, I estimate 800K-1.5M addressable individuals across your 15 DMAs.

CENSUS VALIDATION

Geographic audience sizing MUST include census data. Use web search:
- US: site:census.gov [demographic] [DMA] population
- Canada: site:statcan.gc.ca [CMA] population
- UK: site:ons.gov.uk [region] population

COMMON PITFALLS

PITFALL 1: MISSING DIMENSIONS
Signal: Audience defined by demographics only
Fix: Verify all four dimensions before proceeding

PITFALL 2: INSUFFICIENT SIGNALS
Signal: Performance campaign with only 5 targeting signals
Fix: Match signal count to campaign type

PITFALL 3: IGNORING ADIS
Signal: Discussing audience without offering customer data analysis
Fix: ALWAYS ask about customer data at Step 3

PITFALL 4: UNSIZED AUDIENCE
Signal: Audience described qualitatively without numbers
Fix: Every audience needs size estimate with source

PITFALL 5: NO SEGMENT DIFFERENTIATION
Signal: Same targeting for all customer types
Fix: Use ADIS to create segment-specific targeting
