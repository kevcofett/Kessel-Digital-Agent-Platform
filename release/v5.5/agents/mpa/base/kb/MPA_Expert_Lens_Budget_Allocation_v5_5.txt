COMPLIANCE - 6-RULE COMPLIANT

================================================================================
SECTION 1: PURPOSE AND SCOPE
================================================================================

1.1 PURPOSE

This document provides diagnostic reasoning patterns and expert-level guidance for budget allocation and pacing decisions. The agent MUST use this document to identify issues a novice might miss, surface implications of budget choices, and ask questions that strengthen the media plan.

1.2 SCOPE

This document covers:
- Critical budget considerations that determine success
- Common pitfalls with recommended alternatives
- Diagnostic signals indicating problems
- Implication mapping for budget decisions
- Questions worth asking that users may not consider
- Benchmark reference points for planning

================================================================================
SECTION 2: WHAT MATTERS MOST
================================================================================

2.1 THE FIVE CRITICAL BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS

CONSIDERATION 1: GOAL ALIGNMENT
Budget MUST be mathematically consistent with stated objectives. If the goal is 10,000 customers and budget is 200K, implied CAC is 20 dollars. The agent MUST verify this is realistic for the vertical and channels.

Why it matters: Misaligned budgets create plans that cannot succeed. Either the goal must adjust or the budget must increase.

CONSIDERATION 2: CHANNEL SUFFICIENCY
Each channel needs minimum investment to generate meaningful data and performance. Spreading budget too thin across many channels produces noise, not signal.

Why it matters: Underfunded channels cannot optimize effectively. Better to focus 3 channels well than 6 channels poorly.

CONSIDERATION 3: FUNNEL BALANCE
Budget allocation across funnel stages affects long-term efficiency. Over-investing in lower funnel depletes demand. Over-investing in upper funnel delays results.

Why it matters: The right balance depends on brand maturity, competitive position, and business timeline. Wrong balance sacrifices either efficiency or growth.

CONSIDERATION 4: TIMING AND PACING
How budget is distributed over time affects learning cycles, competitive positioning, and performance optimization.

Why it matters: Front-loaded budgets generate data faster but risk waste before optimization. Back-loaded budgets optimize better but may miss market timing.

CONSIDERATION 5: FLEXIBILITY RESERVES
Plans SHOULD include contingency for optimization shifts, competitive response, and unexpected opportunities.

Why it matters: Rigid budgets cannot respond to performance signals. Industry practice is 10-15 percent flexibility reserve.

================================================================================
SECTION 3: COMMON PITFALLS
================================================================================

3.1 PITFALL: SPREADING TOO THIN

What it looks like:
- Budget divided across 6 or more channels with small allocations
- No channel exceeds minimum investment threshold
- Monthly spend per channel under 2-3K

Why it happens:
- Desire to test everything
- Fear of missing opportunities
- Lack of prioritization framework

Why it matters:
- Platforms need minimum spend to optimize algorithms
- Small budgets generate statistically insignificant data
- Team attention is fragmented

Better approach:
- Prioritize 2-4 channels based on objective alignment
- Fund each channel above minimum threshold
- Add channels only after primary channels mature

3.2 PITFALL: ALL LOWER FUNNEL

What it looks like:
- 80 percent or more budget in search, retargeting, retail media
- Little or no upper funnel investment
- Short-term efficiency metrics look strong

Why it happens:
- Lower funnel shows clearer attribution
- Pressure for immediate results
- ROAS-focused measurement

Why it matters:
- Lower funnel harvests demand created elsewhere
- Without upper funnel, demand pool depletes over time
- Rising CPAs and declining volume follow

Better approach:
- Allocate minimum 30-40 percent to upper and mid funnel
- Accept that upper funnel attribution is harder
- Measure full funnel with MER, not just channel ROAS

3.3 PITFALL: IGNORING MINIMUMS

What it looks like:
- Channel allocations below platform learning thresholds
- Monthly spend under what is needed for 50 or more conversions
- Campaigns stuck in learning phase

Why it happens:
- Budget constraints force compromise
- Unfamiliarity with platform requirements
- Optimistic assumptions about efficiency

Why it matters:
- Platforms need conversion volume to optimize
- Below-threshold campaigns never exit learning
- Data is unreliable for decision-making

Better approach:
- Calculate minimum viable budget per channel before planning
- Cut channels rather than underfund all
- Consolidate budget into fewer, well-funded campaigns

3.4 PITFALL: NO FLEXIBILITY RESERVE

What it looks like:
- 100 percent of budget committed to specific channels
- No contingency for optimization shifts
- No ability to respond to performance signals

Why it happens:
- Pressure to maximize working media
- Planning process requires committed numbers
- Underestimation of uncertainty

Why it matters:
- Best plans require mid-flight adjustment
- Opportunities arise that were not anticipated
- Underperforming channels need reallocation

Better approach:
- Reserve 10-15 percent for optimization
- Build flexibility into contracts where possible
- Establish reallocation triggers and thresholds

3.5 PITFALL: FRONT-LOADING WITHOUT PURPOSE

What it looks like:
- Heavy spend in early weeks
- Declining investment over campaign duration
- No strategic rationale for timing

Why it happens:
- Pressure to spend budget
- Fear of underspending
- Default to aggressive start

Why it matters:
- Early weeks often least efficient due to learning period
- Later optimization benefits wasted if budget exhausted
- Competitive timing may not align

Better approach:
- Match pacing to campaign objectives
- Consider learning period efficiency sacrifice
- Align heavy periods with market timing

================================================================================
SECTION 4: DIAGNOSTIC SIGNALS
================================================================================

4.1 IF BUDGET SEEMS LOW FOR GOALS

What to check:
- Is goal mathematically achievable at benchmark CAC
- Does client understand implied efficiency requirements
- Are there constraints driving the mismatch

Questions to ask:
- Have you achieved this CAC level before and what was the context
- What flexibility exists to adjust either budget or goal
- Are there non-media factors that could improve efficiency

Typical implications:
- Plan will likely underdeliver on stated goals
- Channel selection must prioritize efficiency over reach
- Measurement must account for realistic expectations

4.2 IF BUDGET SEEMS HIGH FOR GOALS

What to check:
- Is there growth beyond stated goal that justifies budget
- Is reach or awareness an unstated objective
- Are there constraints requiring spend regardless of efficiency

Questions to ask:
- Are there objectives beyond customer acquisition
- Is there value in building awareness for future periods
- What happens to unspent budget

Typical implications:
- Opportunity to invest in brand building
- Can afford to test emerging channels
- Should establish more ambitious goals or save for future

4.3 IF CHANNEL MIX SEEMS IMBALANCED

What to check:
- Does allocation match stated objectives
- Are high-allocation channels appropriate for goals
- What is the rationale for the mix

Questions to ask:
- Why is channel X receiving this level of investment
- Have you considered impact on demand generation
- What measurement will validate this mix

Typical implications:
- May need to rebalance based on funnel alignment
- Could be sacrificing long-term for short-term
- Measurement plan needs to account for mix

4.4 IF PACING SEEMS AGGRESSIVE OR CONSERVATIVE

What to check:
- Does pacing match market timing and campaign type
- Is there sufficient time for optimization
- Are there external factors driving timing

Questions to ask:
- What drives this pacing approach
- How will you optimize if front-loaded
- Are there seasonal or competitive factors

Typical implications:
- May need to adjust expectations for learning period
- Could be missing optimal market timing
- Flexibility reserves become more critical

4.5 IF CLIENT HAS NO HISTORICAL DATA

What to check:
- What benchmarks are most relevant
- How much variance should we expect
- What learning plan should accompany the campaign

Questions to ask:
- Is this your first campaign of this type
- What adjacent data might inform expectations
- How will you capture learnings for future planning

Typical implications:
- Projections carry higher uncertainty
- Should widen confidence ranges
- Learning capture becomes priority

SECTION 7: BENCHMARKS AND REFERENCE POINTS
================================================================================

7.1 CHANNEL MINIMUM INVESTMENT THRESHOLDS

These are approximate minimums for meaningful data:

- Paid Search: 1,000-3,000 per month depending on competition

- Lower funnel: 20-30 percent

Short purchase cycle (e-commerce, retail, CPG):
- Upper funnel: 20-30 percent
- Mid funnel: 20-30 percent
- Lower funnel: 40-50 percent

New brand or market entry:

================================================================================
SECTION 8: FALLBACK BEHAVIOR
================================================================================

8.1 IF BUDGET INFORMATION IS INCOMPLETE

When total budget is unknown:
- Ask directly: What is your total media investment for this campaign
- If unavailable: Work backward from goals using benchmark efficiency
- Default: Provide recommendations for multiple budget scenarios

When channel allocation is not specified:
- Ask: Do you have preferences for how budget is distributed
- If unavailable: Recommend based on objectives and funnel alignment
- Default: Use vertical and objective-based benchmarks

8.2 IF GOALS SEEM UNREALISTIC

When budget and goals are misaligned:
- Surface the gap supportively: These numbers imply a CAC of X, which would be exceptional for your vertical
- Provide context: Typical range for similar campaigns is Y to Z
- Offer paths: We can adjust the goal, increase budget, or plan for a test phase
- Document: If proceeding with misaligned numbers, note the assumption and risk

8.3 IF CLIENT INSISTS ON SUBOPTIMAL ALLOCATION

When allocation contradicts best practice:
- Explain implication: This allocation may affect long-term demand generation
- Propose mitigation: We can monitor these signals to catch issues early
- Document: Note the approach and establish review triggers
- Proceed: Support the client decision while ensuring risks are understood
