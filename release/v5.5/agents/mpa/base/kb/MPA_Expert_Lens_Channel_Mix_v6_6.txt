EXAMPLE CHANNEL RESPONSES

EXAMPLE 1: ACQUISITION CAMPAIGN

USER: Which channels should we use for our 300K customer acquisition budget targeting fitness enthusiasts?

RESPONSE:
With your 300K acquisition budget targeting fitness enthusiasts for ecommerce, I recommend a three-channel approach:

Primary - Meta (50%, 150K):
Based on KB data for ecommerce fitness, Meta CPM runs 12-18 with strong interest targeting for fitness audiences. Your 150K budget provides 8-12M impressions.

Secondary - Google Search (30%, 90K):
Based on KB data for ecommerce, search CPC for fitness keywords runs 1.50-3.00. Captures high-intent searchers.

Tertiary - YouTube (20%, 60K):
Based on KB data for ecommerce, YouTube CPV runs 0.02-0.05 for fitness content. Builds awareness and consideration.

Do you have customer data? ADIS can identify which channels your Champions use most.

EXAMPLE 2: WITH ADIS SEGMENTS

USER: Based on my ADIS segments, what channels should we prioritize?

RESPONSE:
Based on your ADIS segment analysis for ecommerce apparel:

Champions (4,500 customers):
- Email: Highest ROI, 40% open rates for this segment
- Direct mail: Premium offers for your best customers
- Avoid: Broad prospecting (wasteful for already loyal)

At Risk (6,750 customers):
- Retargeting: Re-engage across display and social
- Email win-back: Special offers to return
- Budget: Invest before they become Lost

High Propensity (if propensity model run):
- Paid social: Concentrate budget on likely converters
- Search: Higher bid multipliers justified by conversion probability

I recommend allocating 25% to Champions retention, 25% to At Risk reactivation, and 50% to new acquisition using Champions as lookalike seed.

ADIS SEGMENT CHANNEL AFFINITY

When ADIS segments exist, apply these channel affinities:

CHAMPIONS (RFM Score 555)
Best channels:
- Email: Highest engagement, lowest cost
- Direct mail: Premium tactile experience
- Loyalty programs: Exclusive access, rewards
- SMS: Time-sensitive offers

Avoid:
- Broad prospecting: Wasteful for existing loyalists
- Discount-heavy retargeting: Devalues relationship

LOYAL CUSTOMERS (High F and M, Good R)
Best channels:
- Email: Regular engagement
- Social organic: Community building
- Content marketing: Deepen relationship

Avoid:
- Aggressive acquisition messaging: Already converted

AT RISK (Declining R, Previously High F/M)
Best channels:
- Retargeting: Re-engage across platforms
- Email win-back: We miss you campaigns
- Direct mail: Tangible reminder

Avoid:
- Ignoring them: They will become Lost
- Generic messaging: Need personalized re-engagement

NEW CUSTOMERS (Recent R, Low F)
Best channels:
- Onboarding email: Drive second purchase
- Social proof: Reviews, testimonials
- Cross-sell: Related products

Avoid:
- Treating like Champions: They need nurturing first

HIGH PROPENSITY (Propensity Model Score 80%+)
Best channels:
- Paid social: Concentrate spend here
- Search: Higher bid multipliers
- Retargeting: Accelerate conversion

Rationale: Higher conversion likelihood justifies higher spend

HIGH UPLIFT (Uplift Model Score Top Decile)
Best channels:
- A/B test priority: These customers respond to marketing
- Incremental campaigns: Highest ROI from marketing investment

Rationale: These customers convert BECAUSE of marketing, not despite it

CHANNEL MINIMUM THRESHOLDS

Based on KB data, minimum monthly investment for optimization:

Digital Social (Meta, TikTok): 3-5K
Search (Google, Bing): 5-10K
Programmatic Display: 10-15K
CTV/OTT: 15-25K
YouTube: 5-10K
LinkedIn: 5-10K
Podcast/Audio: 10-20K

Below these thresholds, platforms cannot optimize effectively. Better to cut channels than underfund all.

FUNNEL ALLOCATION BENCHMARKS

Based on KB data by campaign objective:

BRAND AWARENESS:
- Upper funnel: 60-70%
- Mid funnel: 20-30%
- Lower funnel: 10-20%

CONSIDERATION/ENGAGEMENT:
- Upper funnel: 30-40%
- Mid funnel: 40-50%
- Lower funnel: 20-30%

PERFORMANCE/ACQUISITION:
- Upper funnel: 20-30%
- Mid funnel: 20-30%
- Lower funnel: 40-60%

RETENTION/LOYALTY:
- Upper funnel: 10-20%
- Mid funnel: 20-30%
- Lower funnel: 50-70%

COMMON PITFALLS

PITFALL 1: IGNORING FUNNEL STAGE
Signal: All budget in lower funnel for awareness objective
Fix: Match channel selection to campaign objective

PITFALL 2: CHANNEL PROLIFERATION
Signal: 6+ channels with small allocations
Fix: Focus 2-4 channels, fund each above minimum

PITFALL 3: IGNORING PLATFORM MINIMUMS
Signal: Campaigns stuck in learning phase
Fix: Consolidate into fewer, well-funded campaigns

PITFALL 4: SEGMENT MISMATCH
Signal: Champions getting acquisition messaging
Fix: Use ADIS segments to tailor channel and message
