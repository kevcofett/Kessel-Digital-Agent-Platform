MPA EXPERT LENS: MEASUREMENT AND ATTRIBUTION v6.6

PURPOSE

This document provides expert-level guidance for measurement and attribution decisions with v6.6 mandatory response patterns and ADIS segment measurement integration. Use this document for Step 8 Measurement.

V6.6 MEASUREMENT RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS

Every measurement discussion MUST include:

1. CONTEXT CALLBACK: Reference objective and KPIs
2. METHODOLOGY MATCH: Align measurement to campaign type
3. KB BENCHMARK: Cite typical lift expectations
4. ADIS INTEGRATION: If segments exist, add segment-level measurement

MEASUREMENT RECOMMENDATION PATTERN

When discussing measurement:

STEP 1: Reference context
For your [objective] campaign measuring [KPI]...

STEP 2: Recommend methodology
I recommend [methodology] because [rationale].

STEP 3: Cite benchmarks
Based on KB data for [vertical], typical [metric] lift is [range].

STEP 4: Add ADIS measurement
With your ADIS segments, I also recommend tracking [segment-level metrics].

MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY SELECTION

LAST-TOUCH ATTRIBUTION
Use when: Quick directional reads, lower funnel campaigns, limited budget
Limitations: Over-credits last touchpoint, ignores assist channels
Based on KB data: Last-touch over-credits search by 30-50%

MULTI-TOUCH ATTRIBUTION (MTA)
Use when: Understanding cross-channel paths, digital-heavy campaigns
Limitations: Limited to trackable touchpoints, privacy headwinds
Based on KB data: MTA reduces search credit 20-30%, increases display credit

MEDIA MIX MODELING (MMM)
Use when: Full funnel view, significant offline spend, long time horizons
Limitations: Requires 2+ years data, less granular, slower insights
Based on KB data: MMM typically shows 15-25% incremental value from upper funnel

INCREMENTALITY TESTING
Use when: Validating true channel impact, budget allocation decisions
Limitations: Requires holdout groups, statistical significance needs volume
Based on KB data: Incremental lift typically 30-50% lower than attributed lift

GEO EXPERIMENTS
Use when: Testing market-level impact, privacy-compliant measurement
Limitations: Requires geographic flexibility, longer test periods
Based on KB data: Geo tests need 4-8 weeks and 10+ markets per cell

BRAND LIFT STUDIES
Use when: Measuring awareness, consideration, brand perception
Limitations: Self-reported, sampling limitations
Based on KB data: Typical brand lift studies show 5-15% awareness lift, 3-8% consideration lift

METHODOLOGY BY OBJECTIVE

BRAND AWARENESS
Primary: Brand lift studies, MMM
Secondary: Reach and frequency analysis
Segment measurement: Awareness lift by ADIS segment

CONSIDERATION
Primary: MTA, engagement metrics
Secondary: Brand lift for consideration
Segment measurement: Engagement rates by ADIS segment

PERFORMANCE/ACQUISITION
Primary: Incrementality testing, MTA
Secondary: Last-touch for directional
Segment measurement: CAC and conversion rate by ADIS segment

RETENTION/LOYALTY
Primary: Cohort analysis, retention tracking
Secondary: Incrementality for campaigns
Segment measurement: Retention rate by ADIS segment, segment migration

ADIS SEGMENT MEASUREMENT

When ADIS segments exist, add segment-level KPIs:

CHAMPIONS SEGMENT
Track:
- Retention rate (target: 90%+ annual)
- Repeat purchase rate
- Average order value trend
- NPS/satisfaction scores

Benchmark: Based on KB data, Champion retention should exceed 85% annually

LOYAL CUSTOMERS SEGMENT
Track:
- Purchase frequency trend
- Cross-sell/upsell rate
- Engagement metrics
- Migration to Champions rate

Benchmark: Based on KB data, 10-15% of Loyal should migrate to Champions annually

AT RISK SEGMENT
Track:
- Reactivation rate (target: 8-15%)
- Win-back campaign response
- Recovered revenue
- Time to reactivation

Benchmark: Based on KB data, well-executed win-back campaigns reactivate 8-15%

NEW CUSTOMERS SEGMENT
Track:
- Second purchase rate (target: 25-40%)
- Time to second purchase
- 90-day retention rate
- Early LTV signals

Benchmark: Based on KB data, second purchase within 60 days indicates 3x higher LTV

PROPENSITY DECILES (If Propensity Model Run)
Track:
- Actual versus predicted conversion by decile
- Lift chart performance
- AUC validation over time

Benchmark: Top decile should convert 5-10x more than bottom decile

UPLIFT DECILES (If Uplift Model Run)
Track:
- Incremental conversions by decile
- True lift versus baseline
- AUUC metric

Benchmark: Top uplift decile should show 3-5x incremental response versus control

HOLDOUT TESTING FRAMEWORK

For incrementality validation:

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
- Minimum 5-10% holdout for statistical power
- Random assignment at user or geo level
- Sufficient duration (4-8 weeks typical)
- Clean measurement of exposed versus holdout

ANALYSIS APPROACH
- Compare conversion rates: exposed versus holdout
- Calculate incremental lift: (exposed rate - holdout rate) / holdout rate
- Confidence intervals at 90% or 95%

Based on KB data, common findings:
- Retargeting incremental lift: 30-50% (versus 100%+ attributed)
- Prospecting incremental lift: 50-70% of attributed
- Brand campaigns: 5-15% incremental lift on baseline

MEASUREMENT PLAN TEMPLATE

For your [objective] campaign with [budget] budget:

PRIMARY KPIs:
- [KPI 1]: Target [value], measurement method [method]
- [KPI 2]: Target [value], measurement method [method]

SECONDARY KPIs:
- [KPI 3]: Directional tracking
- [KPI 4]: Diagnostic metric

SEGMENT-LEVEL KPIS (if ADIS):
- Champions: [retention metric]
- At Risk: [reactivation metric]
- New: [second purchase metric]

MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY:
- Primary: [methodology]
- Validation: [incrementality approach]

REPORTING CADENCE:
- Daily: [metrics]
- Weekly: [metrics]
- Monthly: [metrics]

COMMON PITFALLS

PITFALL 1: SINGLE-SOURCE ATTRIBUTION
Signal: Relying only on platform-reported conversions
Fix: Triangulate with MMM, incrementality testing, or MTA

PITFALL 2: IGNORING INCREMENTALITY
Signal: Optimizing to attributed conversions without validation
Fix: Run holdout tests, especially for retargeting

PITFALL 3: NO SEGMENT MEASUREMENT
Signal: Aggregate metrics only, no ADIS segment tracking
Fix: Add segment-level KPIs for Champions, At Risk, New

PITFALL 4: MISMATCHED METHODOLOGY
Signal: Using last-touch for brand campaign
Fix: Match methodology to campaign objective
