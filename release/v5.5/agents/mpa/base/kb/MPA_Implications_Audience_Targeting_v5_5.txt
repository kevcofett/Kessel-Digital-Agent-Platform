================================================================================
SECTION 1: PURPOSE AND SCOPE
================================================================================

1.1 PURPOSE

This document provides comprehensive implication mapping for audience targeting decisions. The agent MUST consult this document when users define audience strategies, targeting parameters, or segmentation approaches. Expert advisors never simply execute targeting decisions without helping clients understand how audience choices affect reach, efficiency, and long-term customer acquisition.

1.2 SCOPE

This document covers implication chains for:
- Audience size decisions
- Targeting precision trade-offs
- First-party versus third-party data strategies
- Lookalike and expansion strategies
- Audience exclusion decisions
- Retargeting pool management

================================================================================
SECTION 2: AUDIENCE SIZE IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

2.1 NARROW AUDIENCE IMPLICATIONS (UNDER 500K)

When targeting highly specific audiences:
- Week 1-2: Rapid audience saturation possible
- Week 3-4: Frequency escalates quickly within small pool
- Week 5-8: Creative fatigue accelerates due to repeated exposure
- Month 2-3: Audience exhaustion limits scale
- Long-term: Efficiency may decline as addressable market depletes

2.2 MEDIUM AUDIENCE IMPLICATIONS (500K TO 5M)

When targeting moderately sized audiences:
- Week 1-2: Balanced reach and frequency build
- Week 3-4: Optimization identifies high-value segments
- Week 5-8: Sustainable pacing without rapid exhaustion
- Month 2-3: Room for audience expansion based on learnings
- Long-term: Sufficient scale for ongoing optimization

2.3 BROAD AUDIENCE IMPLICATIONS (OVER 5M)

When targeting large audiences:
- Week 1-2: Slow frequency build across large pool
- Week 3-4: Algorithm optimization surfaces high performers
- Week 5-8: Waste inherent in broad targeting
- Month 2-3: Strong learnings for future audience refinement
- Long-term: Maximum reach but efficiency trade-offs

2.4 EXPERT DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS FOR AUDIENCE SIZE

When user defines audience size, agent SHOULD ask:
- What is the estimated addressable market for this product or service
- What frequency level is appropriate for this consideration window
- Is scale or precision the higher priority for this campaign
- What expansion strategy exists if primary audience saturates

================================================================================
SECTION 3: TARGETING PRECISION TRADE-OFFS
================================================================================

3.1 HIGH-PRECISION TARGETING IMPLICATIONS

When applying tight targeting parameters:
- Higher relevance to reached users
- Lower reach within budget
- Higher CPMs due to limited inventory
- Faster audience exhaustion
- Lower waste but potentially missing adjacent opportunities
- Conversion rates typically higher
- Cost per acquisition may be lower or higher depending on competition

3.2 LOW-PRECISION TARGETING IMPLICATIONS

When applying loose targeting parameters:
- Lower relevance to many reached users
- Higher reach within budget
- Lower CPMs due to abundant inventory
- Slower audience exhaustion
- Higher waste but captures adjacent opportunities
- Conversion rates typically lower
- Cost per acquisition depends on waste level

3.3 LAYERED TARGETING IMPLICATIONS

When applying multiple targeting criteria:
- Each layer reduces addressable audience
- Combined layers create very narrow pools
- Inventory availability decreases with each layer
- CPMs increase with targeting complexity
- Risk of over-engineering audience
- May exclude valuable prospects who do not match all criteria

3.4 EXPERT DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS FOR PRECISION

When user discusses targeting precision, agent SHOULD ask:
- What evidence supports these specific targeting parameters
- How will you know if precision is too high or too low
- What is the trade-off tolerance between reach and relevance
- Are there audience signals you may be missing with tight targeting

================================================================================
SECTION 4: FIRST-PARTY DATA STRATEGY IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

4.1 CUSTOMER MATCH IMPLICATIONS

When using customer file matching:
- Match rates vary by platform (40-80 percent typical)
- Audience skews toward known, existing relationships
- Limited prospecting value for new customer acquisition
- Strong for retention and cross-sell campaigns
- Privacy-safe but requires data infrastructure
- Excludes prospects who could become valuable customers

4.2 WEBSITE RETARGETING IMPLICATIONS

When retargeting website visitors:
- Audience limited to those who have visited
- Strong intent signal for most visitors
- Pool size depends on traffic volume
- Recency windows affect pool size and relevance
- 7-day pools show highest intent, 30-day pools provide scale
- Pool health requires ongoing prospecting investment

4.3 CRM INTEGRATION IMPLICATIONS

When integrating CRM data for targeting:
- Enables lifecycle-based targeting
- Requires data synchronization infrastructure
- Customer stage influences messaging relevance
- Suppression of existing customers possible
- Enables true customer acquisition measurement
- Data freshness critical for accuracy

4.4 EXPERT DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS FOR FIRST-PARTY DATA

When user discusses first-party data strategy, agent SHOULD ask:
- What first-party data assets are available and activated
- What is the match rate expectation for customer files
- How frequently is first-party data refreshed

- In-market signals indicate active consideration
- Purchase behavior from data partners
- Data freshness varies significantly
- Strong relevance when data is accurate
- Privacy regulations limiting availability

5.3 CONTEXTUAL TARGETING IMPLICATIONS

When using contextual targeting:
- Based on content being consumed, not user identity
- Privacy-safe as no personal data required
- Relevance depends on content-product fit
- Inventory availability varies by context
- Less precise than behavioral but more privacy-compliant
- Growing importance as third-party cookies decline

5.4 EXPERT DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS FOR THIRD-PARTY DATA

When user discusses third-party data strategy, agent SHOULD ask:
- What third-party data sources are being considered
- How has data accuracy been validated
- What is the privacy compliance status of data sources
- How will you measure third-party data effectiveness

================================================================================
SECTION 6: LOOKALIKE AND EXPANSION IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

6.1 LOOKALIKE AUDIENCE IMPLICATIONS

When creating lookalike audiences:
- Seed audience quality determines lookalike quality
- Expansion percentage affects precision and scale
- 1-2 percent lookalikes most similar to seed
- 5-10 percent lookalikes provide scale with less precision
- Performance typically declines as expansion increases
- Requires sufficient seed size (typically 1,000+ users)

6.2 AUDIENCE EXPANSION IMPLICATIONS

When using platform audience expansion:
- Algorithm identifies users beyond defined audience
- Control over expansion varies by platform
- May reach users outside intended targeting
- Can discover valuable segments not anticipated
- Requires monitoring for audience drift
- Trade-off between algorithm learning and targeting control

6.3 PROSPECTING TO RETARGETING RATIO IMPLICATIONS

When balancing prospecting and retargeting:
- Heavy retargeting depletes pools without replenishment
- Heavy prospecting builds pools but lower immediate efficiency
- Typical healthy ratio is 60-70 percent prospecting, 30-40 percent retargeting
- Ratio varies by funnel stage and campaign objective
- Pool health metrics indicate ratio adjustment needs
- Incrementality differs significantly between prospecting and retargeting

6.4 EXPERT DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS FOR EXPANSION

When user discusses lookalike or expansion strategy, agent SHOULD ask:
- What is the seed audience for lookalike creation
- What expansion percentage balances scale and precision needs
- How will you monitor for audience drift with expansion
- What is the current prospecting to retargeting ratio

================================================================================
SECTION 7: AUDIENCE EXCLUSION IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

7.1 EXISTING CUSTOMER EXCLUSION IMPLICATIONS

When excluding existing customers:
- Enables true new customer acquisition measurement
- Reduces waste spending on already-converted users
- May miss cross-sell and upsell opportunities
- Requires customer file integration and matching
- Match rate limitations mean some customers still reached
- Consider separate campaigns for retention versus acquisition

7.2 RECENT CONVERTER EXCLUSION IMPLICATIONS

When excluding recent converters:
- Prevents annoying users with offers for already-purchased items
- Reduces waste on low-propensity users
- Exclusion window affects pool size
- 7-day exclusion prevents immediate annoyance
- 30-day exclusion for consideration products
- 90-day exclusion for durable goods

7.3 NEGATIVE AUDIENCE IMPLICATIONS

When excluding specific audience segments:
- Reduces waste on low-value segments
- May exclude some potential converters incorrectly
- Requires ongoing validation of exclusion effectiveness
- Platform limitations on exclusion implementation
- Consider suppression versus exclusion approaches
- Brand safety exclusions differ from performance exclusions

7.4 EXPERT DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS FOR EXCLUSIONS

When user discusses audience exclusions, agent SHOULD ask:
- What data enables exclusion implementation
- What is the match rate for exclusion audiences
- How will you validate exclusions are working correctly
- Are there segments being excluded that should be reconsidered

================================================================================
SECTION 8: RETARGETING POOL MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS

8.1 POOL HEALTH IMPLICATIONS

Healthy retargeting pools require:
- Consistent traffic from prospecting investment
- Reasonable recency windows for intent relevance
- Sufficient size for campaign scale requirements
- Diversity of entry points and behaviors
- Regular refresh through new visitor acquisition
- Monitoring of conversion rate trends within pools

8.2 POOL DEPLETION IMPLICATIONS

When retargeting pools shrink:
- Frequency increases for remaining pool members
- Performance typically declines as easy conversions complete
- CPMs may decrease due to smaller audience
- Incrementality declines as you reach the same users repeatedly
- Prospecting investment needed to rebuild
- Consider expanding recency windows temporarily

8.3 POOL SEGMENTATION IMPLICATIONS

When segmenting retargeting pools:
- Higher-intent segments warrant higher investment
- Product page visitors outperform homepage visitors
- Cart abandoners show highest purchase intent
- Recency segments have different value

SECTION 9: IMPLICATION CHAIN EXAMPLES
================================================================================

9.1 EXAMPLE: NARROW AUDIENCE REQUEST

User scenario: We want to target only CFOs at companies with 500+ employees in the manufacturing sector.

Agent MUST communicate this implication chain:
- Audience size: Estimated 50,000-100,000 individuals nationally
- Week 1-2: Rapid saturation of addressable audience
- Week 3-4: Frequency escalates to 10+ per user
- Week 5-8: Audience exhaustion limits continued reach
- Cost implications: CPMs 3-5x higher than broader B2B targeting
- Scale limitations: May not support significant budget

Agent SHOULD recommend:
- Validate audience size meets minimum thresholds
- Consider expansion to adjacent titles (VP Finance, Controller)
- Set strict frequency caps to prevent over-exposure
- Plan for audience refresh or expansion mid-campaign
- Set realistic expectations for reach and scale

9.2 EXAMPLE: THIRD-PARTY DATA RELIANCE

- Develop first-party data strategy for long-term sustainability
- Validate data source privacy compliance
- Consider contextual alternatives as backup

9.3 EXAMPLE: HEAVY RETARGETING ALLOCATION

User scenario: We want to put 70 percent of budget into retargeting.

Agent MUST communicate this implication chain:
- Week 1-2: Strong efficiency metrics from high-intent audiences
- Week 3-4: Pool depletion begins if traffic insufficient
- Week 5-8: Incrementality declines as easy conversions complete
- Month 2-3: Pool shrinks without prospecting replenishment
- Long-term: Customer acquisition becomes harder as pools deplete
