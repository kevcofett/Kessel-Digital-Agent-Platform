================================================================================
SECTION 1: PURPOSE AND SCOPE
================================================================================

1.1 PURPOSE

This document provides comprehensive implication mapping for budget decisions. The agent MUST consult this document when users propose budget changes and MUST articulate second-order and third-order effects before proceeding. Expert advisors never simply execute budget changes without helping clients understand downstream implications.

1.2 SCOPE

This document covers implication chains for:
- Total budget increases
- Total budget decreases
- Channel-to-channel reallocations
- Pacing and timing adjustments
- Flexibility allocation decisions

================================================================================
SECTION 2: BUDGET INCREASE IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

2.1 IMMEDIATE EFFECTS (WEEK 1-2)

When budget increases, the agent MUST anticipate and communicate:
- Increased impression volume requires creative fatigue monitoring
- Higher spend velocity may trigger platform learning phase resets
- Audience expansion occurs as frequency caps are reached faster
- Competitive dynamics shift as share of voice increases

2.2 MEDIUM-TERM EFFECTS (WEEKS 3-8)

The agent MUST explain that budget increases typically produce:
- Diminishing returns begin appearing at 120-150 percent of baseline
- Cost per acquisition often rises 10-20 percent before stabilizing
- Incremental reach slows as core audiences saturate
- Cross-channel attribution becomes more complex as touchpoints multiply

2.3 LONG-TERM EFFECTS (MONTHS 2-6)

The agent MUST help users understand:
- Brand awareness metrics respond with 6-12 week lag
- Customer lifetime value cohorts need 90+ days to validate
- Competitive response typically occurs within 60-90 days
- Market share gains require sustained investment to maintain

2.4 EXPERT DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS

When user proposes budget increase, agent SHOULD ask:
- What triggered this increase and is the driver sustainable
- Are current channels already showing diminishing returns signals
- Is creative pipeline sufficient to support increased volume
- What success metrics will validate the increased investment

================================================================================
SECTION 3: BUDGET DECREASE IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

3.1 IMMEDIATE EFFECTS (WEEK 1-2)

When budget decreases, the agent MUST articulate:
- Reduced frequency may push below effective threshold
- Platform algorithms may deprioritize campaigns with lower spend
- Audience reach contracts to highest-propensity segments
- Share of voice decreases relative to competitors

3.2 MEDIUM-TERM EFFECTS (WEEKS 3-8)

The agent MUST explain that budget decreases typically produce:
- Pipeline velocity slows with 4-6 week lag
- Brand awareness metrics begin declining after 8 weeks
- Cost efficiency may temporarily improve as waste is eliminated
- Competitor share of voice increases proportionally

3.3 LONG-TERM EFFECTS (MONTHS 2-6)

The agent MUST help users understand:
- Demand generation deficit compounds over time
- Customer acquisition costs rise as warm audiences shrink
- Market position becomes harder to regain after extended pullback
- Brand equity erosion accelerates after 3-4 months of reduced presence

3.4 EXPERT DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS

When user proposes budget decrease, agent SHOULD ask:
- Is this reduction permanent or temporary with restoration timeline
- Which business objective is being deprioritized
- What monitoring will trigger restoration of funding
- Are there efficiency opportunities before reducing total budget

================================================================================
SECTION 4: CHANNEL REALLOCATION IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

4.1 UPPER FUNNEL TO LOWER FUNNEL SHIFT

When reallocating from awareness to conversion channels:
- Short-term efficiency metrics typically improve
- Lead volume may increase for 4-8 weeks
- Demand generation deficit emerges at 8-12 weeks
- Customer acquisition costs rise as warm audiences deplete
- Brand awareness begins declining after 6-8 weeks

4.2 LOWER FUNNEL TO UPPER FUNNEL SHIFT

When reallocating from conversion to awareness channels:
- Short-term efficiency metrics typically decline
- Lead volume decreases for 4-8 weeks
- Brand metrics begin improving at 6-12 weeks
- Long-term CAC improvement possible after 3-4 months
- Sales cycle may lengthen during transition

4.3 BETWEEN CHANNELS AT SAME FUNNEL STAGE

When reallocating between peer channels:
- Learning phase disruption in both source and destination channels
- Audience overlap effects may be positive or negative
- Platform algorithm resets require 2-3 weeks to stabilize
- Creative requirements may differ significantly

4.4 EXPERT DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS

When user proposes channel reallocation, agent SHOULD ask:
- What performance signal is driving this reallocation
- Have you isolated channel effect from creative or audience effects
- What is the timeline for evaluating the reallocation success
- Is the source channel truly underperforming or facing temporary headwinds

================================================================================
SECTION 5: PACING AND TIMING IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

5.1 FRONT-LOADING BUDGET

When accelerating spend earlier in campaign period:
- Competitive positioning advantage during high-intent periods
- Risk of creative fatigue before campaign completion
- May exhaust optimal audience segments prematurely
- Limited flexibility for in-flight optimization

5.2 BACK-LOADING BUDGET

When reserving budget for later in campaign period:
- Risk of under-delivery if channels cannot absorb increased spend
- May miss early-period high-intent audiences
- Platform algorithms may favor competitors during light periods
- Provides optimization learning before scaling

5.3 EVEN PACING

When distributing budget evenly across campaign period:
- Balanced reach and frequency throughout flight
- May underinvest during peak opportunity periods
- Predictable performance patterns for forecasting
- Reduced risk of delivery issues

5.4 EXPERT DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS

When user proposes pacing changes, agent SHOULD ask:
- What external event or insight is driving the pacing preference
- How will you know if the chosen pacing strategy is working
- What flexibility do you want to preserve for optimization
- Are there seasonal or competitive factors to consider

================================================================================
SECTION 6: FLEXIBILITY ALLOCATION IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

6.1 HIGH FLEXIBILITY RESERVE (20-30 PERCENT)

When holding significant budget in reserve:
- Maximum optimization opportunity during flight
- Lower initial reach and frequency
- Competitive disadvantage during campaign launch
- Requires robust in-flight decision framework

6.2 LOW FLEXIBILITY RESERVE (5-10 PERCENT)

When committing most budget upfront:
- Maximum initial reach and frequency
- Limited ability to respond to performance signals
- Reduced optimization opportunity
- Higher risk if initial strategy underperforms

6.3 EXPERT DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS

When discussing flexibility allocation, agent SHOULD ask:
- How confident are you in the initial channel and audience strategy
- What decision rights exist for in-flight reallocation
- How frequently will performance be reviewed
- What performance thresholds would trigger reallocation

================================================================================
SECTION 7: IMPLICATION CHAIN EXAMPLES
================================================================================

7.1 EXAMPLE: 30 PERCENT BUDGET INCREASE

User scenario: We want to increase Q2 budget from 500K to 650K.

Agent MUST communicate this implication chain:
- Week 1-2: Platform learning phases reset, CPMs may spike temporarily
- Week 3-4: Incremental reach slows as we exhaust core audience segments
- Week 5-8: Diminishing returns appear, CPA rises 15-25 percent versus baseline
- Month 2-3: Brand awareness responds, consideration metrics improve
- Month 3-6: If sustained, market share gains become measurable

Agent SHOULD recommend:
- Phase the increase over 3-4 weeks to limit learning phase disruption
- Increase creative pipeline to support higher volume
- Set expectation that CPA efficiency will temporarily decline
- Define success metrics for the incremental investment

7.2 EXAMPLE: 25 PERCENT BUDGET DECREASE

User scenario: We need to reduce Q2 budget from 500K to 375K.

Agent MUST communicate this implication chain:
- Week 1-2: Reach and frequency decline proportionally
- Week 3-4: Short-term efficiency may appear to improve
- Week 5-8: Pipeline velocity slows as demand generation reduces
- Month 2-3: Brand awareness begins declining
- Month 3-6: Customer acquisition costs rise as warm audiences deplete

Agent SHOULD recommend:
- Prioritize highest-performing channels rather than reducing all proportionally
- Cut channels below minimum viable thresholds entirely
- Shift budget to lower-funnel channels only if short-term efficiency is priority
- Set realistic expectations for reduced goal achievement

7.3 EXAMPLE: CHANNEL REALLOCATION

User scenario: Move 100K from Display to Paid Social.

Agent MUST communicate this implication chain:
- Week 1-2: Display reach and frequency decline, Social enters learning phase
- Week 3-4: Display retargeting pools shrink, Social algorithm optimizes
- Week 5-8: Cross-channel attribution shifts as path to conversion changes
- Month 2-3: Full effect of reallocation becomes measurable
- Month 3-6: Long-term impact on brand awareness if Display was upper-funnel

Agent SHOULD recommend:
- Confirm Display underperformance is not creative or audience issue
- Phase the shift over 2-4 weeks to limit disruption
- Monitor Display retargeting pool health during transition
- Set Social performance expectations for learning period

SECTION 9: AGENT RESPONSE PATTERNS
================================================================================

9.1 WHEN USER PROPOSES BUDGET INCREASE

Agent MUST:
- Acknowledge the opportunity
- Articulate immediate, medium, and long-term implications
- Explain diminishing returns expectations
- Recommend phased approach with monitoring

Example response pattern:
Increasing budget to [amount] creates meaningful opportunity for expanded reach. In the first few weeks, expect platform learning phases to reset and CPMs to temporarily spike. By weeks 3-8, diminishing returns typically emerge with CPA rising 15-25 percent above baseline before stabilizing. Brand awareness metrics respond over 6-12 weeks. Recommend phasing the increase over 3-4 weeks and expanding creative pipeline to support higher volume. What success metrics will validate this investment?

9.2 WHEN USER PROPOSES BUDGET DECREASE

Agent MUST:
- Acknowledge the constraint
- Articulate immediate, medium, and long-term implications
- Explain demand generation deficit risk
- Recommend prioritization over proportional cuts

Example response pattern:
Reducing budget to [amount] requires careful prioritization. In the first few weeks, reach and frequency decline proportionally. Short-term efficiency may appear to improve. By weeks 5-8, pipeline velocity typically slows as demand generation reduces. Brand awareness begins declining after 8 weeks and customer acquisition costs rise over 3-6 months as warm audiences deplete. Recommend concentrating budget on highest-performing channels and cutting underperformers entirely rather than underfunding all channels. Which channels are most critical to preserve?

9.3 WHEN USER PROPOSES CHANNEL REALLOCATION

Agent MUST:
- Acknowledge the rationale
- Articulate source and destination channel implications
- Explain cross-channel attribution effects
- Recommend phased transition with monitoring

Example response pattern:
Shifting [amount] from [source] to [destination] will produce immediate and delayed effects. In the first 2 weeks, [source] reach declines while [destination] enters learning phase. By weeks 3-4, [source] audience pools shrink while [destination] algorithm optimizes. Cross-channel attribution shifts over 5-8 weeks as path to conversion changes. Full impact becomes measurable at month 2-3. Recommend phasing the shift over 2-4 weeks to limit disruption. What performance signal is driving this reallocation?
