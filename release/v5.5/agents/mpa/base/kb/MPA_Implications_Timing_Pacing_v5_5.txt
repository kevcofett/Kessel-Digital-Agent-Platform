SECTION 1: PURPOSE AND SCOPE
================================================================================

1.1 PURPOSE

This document provides comprehensive implication mapping for timing and pacing decisions. The agent MUST consult this document when users define campaign timing, pacing strategies, or flight schedules. Expert advisors never simply accept timing decisions without helping clients understand how timing affects performance, competitive dynamics, and measurement.

1.2 SCOPE

This document covers implication chains for:
- Campaign flight timing decisions
- Pacing strategy selection
- Seasonal and event-based timing
- Always-on versus flighting strategies
- Launch timing and market entry

================================================================================
SECTION 2: FLIGHT TIMING IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

2.1 SHORT FLIGHTS (1-4 WEEKS)

When planning short campaign flights:
- Week 1: Learning phase consumes significant portion of flight
- Week 2-3: Optimization limited by insufficient data
- Week 4: Performance stabilizes just as flight ends
- Post-flight: Measurement window too short for accurate attribution
- Long-term: Brand impact minimal, momentum lost between flights

2.2 MEDIUM FLIGHTS (5-8 WEEKS)

When planning medium campaign flights:
- Week 1-2: Learning phase completes for most channels
- Week 3-4: Optimization adjustments possible with data
- Week 5-6: Performance reaches steady state
- Week 7-8: Creative fatigue may emerge
- Post-flight: Sufficient data for performance analysis

2.3 LONG FLIGHTS (9+ WEEKS)

When planning long campaign flights:
- Week 1-2: Learning phase completes
- Week 3-6: Multiple optimization cycles possible
- Week 7-9: Creative refresh likely required
- Week 10+: Audience fatigue and frequency caps critical
- Long-term: Brand awareness builds cumulatively

2.4 EXPERT DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS FOR FLIGHT TIMING

When user defines flight timing, agent SHOULD ask:
- What objective is this flight designed to achieve
- Does the flight length allow sufficient learning phase
- What creative refresh strategy exists for longer flights
- How will success be measured at flight conclusion

================================================================================
SECTION 3: PACING STRATEGY IMPLICATIONS

When accelerating spend to early flight period:
- Week 1-2: Maximum reach during high-priority period
- Week 3-4: Creative fatigue accelerates
- Week 5-6: Audience exhaustion risk increases
- Week 7-8: Limited budget remaining for optimization
- Long-term: Momentum advantage but flexibility sacrificed

3.2 BACK-LOADED PACING IMPLICATIONS

When reserving spend for later flight period:
- Week 1-2: Lower reach and frequency during opening
- Week 3-4: Competitors may gain advantage early
- Week 5-6: Learning phase data informs later optimization
- Week 7-8: Maximum investment with optimization insights
- Long-term: Risk of under-delivery if channels cannot absorb surge

3.3 EVEN PACING IMPLICATIONS

When distributing spend evenly across flight:
- Week 1-2: Consistent reach from campaign start
- Week 3-4: Predictable frequency builds
- Week 5-6: Steady optimization possible throughout
- Week 7-8: Balanced performance throughout flight
- Long-term: No peak impact but sustained presence

3.4 PULSE PACING IMPLICATIONS

When alternating high and low spend periods:
- Week 1-2: High-burst reaches awareness threshold quickly
- Week 3-4: Low period allows audience refresh
- Week 5-6: Second burst rebuilds momentum
- Week 7-8: Pattern continues based on burst schedule
- Long-term: Efficient reach with managed frequency

3.5 EXPERT DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS FOR PACING

When user defines pacing strategy, agent SHOULD ask:
- What external events or seasonality drive this pacing preference
- What flexibility exists to adjust pacing in-flight
- Are channels capable of absorbing accelerated spend

================================================================================
SECTION 9: IMPLICATION CHAIN EXAMPLES
================================================================================

9.1 EXAMPLE: SHORT FLIGHT REQUEST

User scenario: We want to run a 2-week campaign for our product launch.

Agent MUST communicate this implication chain:
- Week 1: Learning phase consumes 50 percent or more of flight
- Week 2: Limited optimization possible before flight ends
- Post-flight: Insufficient data for accurate performance assessment
- Brand impact: Minimal awareness building in short window
- Recommendation: Consider 4-6 week minimum for measurable impact

Agent SHOULD recommend:
- Extend to 4+ weeks if budget allows to complete learning phase
- If 2 weeks required, concentrate budget for maximum reach
- Set realistic expectations for measurement limitations
- Plan immediate follow-on flight to maintain momentum

9.2 EXAMPLE: FRONT-LOADED PACING REQUEST

User scenario: We want to spend 60 percent of budget in the first 2 weeks.

Agent MUST communicate this implication chain:
- Week 1-2: Maximum reach and frequency during priority period
- Week 3-4: Limited budget for optimization based on learnings
- Week 5-6: Reduced presence during later flight period
- Creative: Accelerated fatigue risk with concentrated exposure
- Flexibility: Limited ability to respond to performance signals later

Agent SHOULD recommend:
- Confirm business reason justifies front-loading
