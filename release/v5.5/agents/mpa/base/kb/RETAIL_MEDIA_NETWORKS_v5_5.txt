SECTION 3 - RETAIL MEDIA STRATEGY FRAMEWORK

ENDEMIC VERSUS NON-ENDEMIC ADVERTISERS

Endemic Advertisers (Sell products at the retailer)
- Can measure direct sales attribution
- Sponsored products typically highest ROI
- Defend and grow shelf share
- Balance advertising investment with retail margin
- Typical budget range - 3 to 15 percent of retailer sales

Non-Endemic Advertisers (Do not sell at the retailer)
- Use audience targeting for reach
- Cannot measure direct sales but can track secondary metrics
- Often leverage off-site inventory
- Categories include auto, finance, travel, entertainment, insurance
- Typical CPMs 20 to 40 percent higher than endemic

FUNNEL STRATEGY

Lower Funnel - Conversion Focus
- Sponsored products in search results
- Retargeting recent browsers
- Promotional placements for price-sensitive buyers
- Metrics - ROAS, ACOS, conversion rate

Mid Funnel - Consideration
- Category page placements
- Competitor conquesting
- Product display advertising
- Metrics - detail page views, add to cart, brand searches

Upper Funnel - Awareness
- Homepage and high-traffic placements
- Off-site display with retailer audiences
- CTV and video for reach
- Metrics - impressions, reach, brand lift, new-to-brand

NETWORK SELECTION CRITERIA

- What level of self-serve versus managed service is available
- Are volume commitments required

Data and Measurement
- Is closed-loop attribution available
- Can incrementality be measured
- What reporting granularity is provided
- Can data be exported for unified analysis

================================================================================

SECTION 4 - BUDGET ALLOCATION GUIDANCE

STARTING INVESTMENT LEVELS

Test and Learn Phase (3 to 6 months)
- Amazon Ads - Minimum $10,000 to $25,000 monthly for meaningful testing
- Walmart Connect - Minimum $15,000 to $30,000 monthly
- Other networks - Minimum $10,000 to $20,000 monthly
- Smaller budgets possible but limit optimization potential

Scale Phase
- Allocate budget based on sales distribution across retailers
- Typically 5 to 15 percent of retail sales at each retailer
- Consider share of voice versus competitors
- Account for retailer-specific margin requirements

BUDGET DISTRIBUTION FRAMEWORK

For Endemic Advertisers
- Allocate roughly proportional to sales by retailer
- Weight toward retailers with growth opportunity
- Consider incrementality not just efficiency
- Reserve budget for defensive spending where share is threatened

Example Distribution for CPG Brand with $500K Monthly RMN Budget
- Amazon - 50 percent ($250K) reflecting marketplace sales weight
- Walmart - 25 percent ($125K) reflecting offline strength
- Target - 10 percent ($50K) for premium brand building
- Grocery (Kroger, Instacart, others) - 15 percent ($75K) for category-specific reach

For Non-Endemic Advertisers
- Focus on networks with strongest audience match
- Prioritize measurement capabilities
- Consider off-site inventory for scale
- Typical allocation weighted to Amazon DSP and Walmart off-site

================================================================================

SECTION 5 - MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK

CORE METRICS

Sales Metrics
- ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) - Revenue divided by ad spend
- ACOS (Advertising Cost of Sale) - Ad spend divided by attributed sales
- Attributed sales - Direct sales tied to ad exposure or click
- Incremental sales - Sales that would not have occurred without advertising

Customer Metrics
- NTB Rate (New-to-Brand) - Percentage of purchasers new to brand
- Customer acquisition cost - Spend to acquire new customer
- Repeat purchase rate - Follow-on purchases from acquired customers
- Share of wallet - Brand share within customer's category spending

Efficiency Metrics
- CPC (Cost per Click) - For sponsored search placements
- CPM (Cost per Mille) - For display and awareness
- CTR (Click-through Rate) - Engagement indicator
- Conversion rate - Purchases divided by clicks or landing page views

Brand Metrics
- Brand search volume - Organic searches for brand
- Detail page views - Product page visits
- Add-to-cart rate - Purchase intent indicator
- Share of voice - Brand visibility relative to competitors

INCREMENTALITY MEASUREMENT

Why Incrementality Matters
- ROAS alone may credit sales that would have happened organically
- Loyal customers may see ads but would purchase regardless
- True incremental impact often lower than attributed ROAS suggests
- Incrementality testing isolates actual advertising effect

Testing Approaches
- Geo-based holdouts - Regions without advertising versus exposed
- PSA testing - Public service ads to control group
- Ghost bidding - Bid without showing ads to measure baseline
- On/off testing - Periods without advertising to observe decay

Typical Findings
- Sponsored products incrementality - 30 to 50 percent of attributed
- Display advertising incrementality - 20 to 40 percent of attributed
- Brand building campaigns often show higher incrementality
- Conquest campaigns typically higher incrementality than defense

CROSS-RETAILER MEASUREMENT

Challenges
- Each network reports independently
- No unified view across retail media spend
- Different attribution windows and methodologies
- Potential overlap in off-site reach

Solutions
- Marketing Mix Modeling to allocate credit holistically
- Clean room matching with first-party customer data
- Unified reporting dashboards aggregating network data
- Holdout testing across total retail media investment

================================================================================

SECTION 6 - OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE

Account Structure
- Separate campaigns by objective (brand, category, product)
- Segment by funnel stage
- Isolate testing budgets from core campaigns
- Consider competitor and non-competitor keyword separation

Targeting Layers
- Keyword targeting for search placements
- Category and product targeting for display
- Audience targeting using retailer segments
- Contextual targeting based on browse behavior

Creative Requirements
- Product images must meet retailer specifications
- Video creative increasingly available across networks
- Dynamic creative optimization limited but growing
- Brand store and landing page investments

OPTIMIZATION CADENCE

Daily
- Budget pacing monitoring
- Bid adjustments for major keywords
- Pause significantly underperforming placements

Weekly
- Keyword and targeting performance review
- Negative keyword additions
- Budget reallocation across campaigns

Monthly
- Full performance analysis
- Incrementality assessment
- Strategy refinement
- New test planning

Quarterly
- Cross-network portfolio review
- Budget allocation reassessment
- Competitive benchmarking
- Annual planning inputs

COMMON PITFALLS

Over-Investing in Brand Defense
- Existing customers see brand ads regardless
- Measure incrementality before heavy brand term bidding
- Consider organic baseline before attributing sales

Ignoring Cannibalization
- Retail media may shift sales between retailers
- Total brand sales matter more than retailer-specific ROAS
- Account for margin differences by retailer

Under-Investing in New-to-Brand
- NTB rate is critical for sustainable growth
- Conquest and category campaigns build customer base
- Balance efficiency with customer acquisition

Siloed Network Management
- Each network team optimizes independently
- Portfolio-level optimization missed
- Use unified measurement to allocate holistically

================================================================================

SECTION 7 - INTEGRATION WITH BROADER MEDIA PLAN

ROLE IN MEDIA MIX

Lower Funnel Complement
- Retail media excels at converting demand generated elsewhere
- Pair with upper funnel investment to fill the funnel
- Do not expect retail media alone to drive awareness

First-Party Data Activation
- Retail data can enhance targeting across channels
- Off-site inventory extends retail audiences to broader reach
- Data clean rooms enable matching without data leakage

Measurement Anchor
- Closed-loop sales data validates other channel performance
- Use retail media incrementality as benchmark
- Calibrate MMM with retail media results

BUDGET TRADE-OFF CONSIDERATIONS

Retail Media Versus Retailer Trade Spend
- Some budget may shift from trade to media
- Joint business planning should address holistically
- Margin and advertising work together

Retail Media Versus Social Commerce
- Platforms building commerce capabilities
- Some audience overlap with retail networks
- Test incremental reach across approaches

Retail Media Versus Direct-to-Consumer
- Brand.com and retail not mutually exclusive
- Different margin and data ownership trade-offs
- Customer journey often spans both channels

================================================================================

SECTION 8 - DECISION GUIDANCE FOR MEDIA PLANNERS

WHEN RECOMMENDING RETAIL MEDIA

Include retail media when:
- Brand sells products at retail (endemic)
- Customer acquisition is a priority
- Lower-funnel conversion support needed
- First-party data targeting is valuable
- Measurement accuracy is important
- Omnichannel presence is strategic goal

Consider limiting retail media when:
- Budget insufficient for meaningful test (under $10K monthly)
- Brand does not sell at retail and audience fit is poor
- Upper funnel brand building is sole objective
- Direct-to-consumer is strategic priority

NETWORK RECOMMENDATIONS BY SCENARIO

Scenario - CPG Brand with Broad Retail Distribution
- Lead with Amazon given marketplace scale
- Add Walmart for omnichannel and offline attribution
- Layer in grocery specialists for category presence
- Consider Target for premium brand positioning

Scenario - Electronics Brand
- Amazon as primary for marketplace presence
- Best Buy for consideration phase
- Walmart for mass market reach
- Direct comparison to DTC advertising ROI

Scenario - Beauty Brand
- Ulta for category specialization
- Target Roundel for premium positioning
- Amazon for marketplace reach
- Consider Sephora at Kohls partnership

Scenario - Non-Endemic Advertiser (Auto, Finance, Travel)
- Amazon DSP for scale and audience quality
- Walmart off-site for mass reach
- Focus on measurement despite lack of sales attribution
- Compare to other audience targeting alternatives

BUDGET ALLOCATION GUIDANCE

For budgets under $50K monthly
- Focus on single network to achieve meaningful scale
- Select based on sales distribution or audience fit
- Prioritize learning over diversification

For budgets $50K to $200K monthly
- Primary network with 60 to 70 percent of budget
- Secondary network with 20 to 30 percent for testing
- Reserve 10 percent for experimental placements

For budgets over $200K monthly
- Full portfolio approach across relevant networks
- Allocate roughly proportional to sales opportunity
- Dedicated budget for incrementality testing
- Unified measurement across networks

================================================================================

SECTION 9 - FALLBACK BEHAVIOR

IF RETAILER-SPECIFIC DATA IS UNAVAILABLE

When specific benchmark or capability information is not known for a retailer:

- Recommend contacting retailer media team for current capabilities
- Use general retail media benchmarks as directional guidance
- Suggest starting with conservative test budget
- Emphasize measurement setup before scaling

IF BUDGET RECOMMENDATIONS ARE UNCLEAR

When optimal budget is uncertain:

- Default to 5 to 10 percent of retailer sales for endemic advertisers
- Recommend minimum $15K to $25K monthly for meaningful test
- Suggest 3 to 6 month test period before major commitment
- Emphasize learning objectives over immediate efficiency

IF CATEGORY-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE IS NEEDED

When category benchmarks are not available:

- Use general retail media benchmarks as starting point
- Recommend competitor analysis through share of voice tools
- Suggest incrementality testing to establish baseline
- Adjust expectations based on category dynamics
