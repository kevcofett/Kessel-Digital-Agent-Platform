VERSION: 5.5
DATE: January 2026
STATUS: Production Ready
COMPLIANCE: 6-Rule Compliant
PURPOSE: Foundational philosophy, patterns, and lessons governing media planning
COMPLIANCE: 6-Rule Compliance Framework

================================================================================
OVERVIEW
================================================================================

This document contains the foundational philosophy, patterns, and hard-won lessons that govern all media planning recommendations. These are strong defaults, explicitly overridable when conditions warrant.

The agent MUST apply these principles as defaults and challenge approaches that conflict with them. When user explicitly requests deviation with valid reasoning, agent may accommodate but must document the departure.

================================================================================
SECTION 1: FOUNDATIONAL BELIEFS
================================================================================

1.1 CUSTOMERS OVER TRANSACTIONS

CORE PRINCIPLE:
Incremental customers are the primary acquisition unit, not transactions. Transactions are downstream outcomes of customer relationships.

WHY THIS MATTERS:
Optimizing for orders systematically overspends on repeat buyers who would purchase anyway. This inflates attributed revenue while delivering minimal incremental value.

THE MATH:
- Existing customer order: $100 revenue, $0 incremental (would have occurred)
- New customer order: $100 revenue, $100 incremental + future LTV
- Cost to acquire: Often similar via paid media
- Result: Transaction optimization pays full CAC for zero incremental value

EXAMPLE SCENARIO:
Campaign A: 1,000 orders, 200 new customers, 800 repeat buyers
- Attributed Revenue: $100,000
- True Incremental Revenue: $20,000 + future LTV of 200 customers
- CAC Paid: $50,000
- Effective CAC for new customers: $250 (not $50)

Campaign B: 600 orders, 500 new customers, 100 repeat buyers
- Attributed Revenue: $60,000
- True Incremental Revenue: $50,000 + future LTV of 500 customers
- CAC Paid: $50,000
- Effective CAC for new customers: $100

Campaign B delivers 2.5x more incremental value despite 40% fewer attributed orders.

DEFAULT STANCE:
Always recommend customer-based KPIs for acquisition campaigns. Track new customer percentage alongside order volume.

WHEN TO DEVIATE:
- Pure awareness campaigns where customer tracking unavailable
- Retail/CPG where individual customer identity unknown
- Client explicitly optimizing for total revenue regardless of source
- Document deviation and recommend customer tracking implementation

AGENT BEHAVIOR:
- Challenge order-based targets without new customer distinction
- Recommend new customer percentage targets (minimum 60% for acquisition)
- Flag campaigns with high repeat buyer attribution

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.2 INCREMENTALITY FIRST

CORE PRINCIPLE:
Every recommendation must consider "would this outcome happen without media investment?" Incrementality is the only true measure of media value.

DEFINITION:
Incrementality = Outcomes WITH media - Outcomes WITHOUT media

WHY THIS MATTERS:
Platform attribution systematically over-credits paid media by counting conversions that would have occurred organically. This leads to:
- Overspending on branded search (capturing existing demand)
- Over-investing in retargeting (reaching decided buyers)
- Under-investing in true prospecting

METHODS TO MEASURE INCREMENTALITY:

METHOD 1: Geographic Holdouts
- Identify matched markets
- Hold out media in test markets
- Compare conversion difference
- Minimum 4-week test window
- Requires 10%+ holdout for statistical power

METHOD 2: Audience Holdouts
- Randomly split qualified audience
- Expose one group to ads, hold out control
- Measure conversion difference
- Platform-supported in most DSPs

METHOD 3: Channel Holdouts
- Pause individual channels for test periods
- Measure total conversion impact
- Isolate channel incrementality
- Risk: May lose optimization history

METHOD 4: Ghost Ads / PSA Tests
- Show PSA to control group instead of brand ad
- Both groups entered into attribution
- Difference represents incrementality
- Most rigorous but complex to implement

THE COST OF IGNORING INCREMENTALITY:
- 30-70% of attributed conversions are typically non-incremental
- Overstated ROAS by 2-5x is common
- Misallocated budgets favor low-incrementality channels
- True acquisition costs hidden by inflated metrics

DEFAULT STANCE:
Incrementality testing is the default recommendation. Holdout groups are standard practice. Every media plan should include a testing component.

WHEN TO DEVIATE:
- Budget under $50K (insufficient for statistical significance)
- Campaign duration under 4 weeks
- Client explicitly declines testing
- Crisis/urgent campaigns requiring full deployment
- Document why testing not included

AGENT BEHAVIOR:
- Recommend holdout percentage (typically 10-20%)
- Include test design in media plan
- Calculate sample size requirements
- Flag plans without incrementality measurement

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.3 NET ECONOMICS ALWAYS

CORE PRINCIPLE:
Gross metrics mislead. All targets should be set on net figures. Gross figures are for monitoring only, not optimization.

COMPONENTS OF NET ECONOMICS:

REVENUE ADJUSTMENTS:
- Gross Revenue: Total order value
- Returns: Subtract (typically 15-30% for apparel)
- Cancellations: Subtract (varies by vertical)
- Discounts: Already reflected or subtract if not
- Net Revenue: What actually collects

COST ADJUSTMENTS:
- COGS: Cost of goods sold
- Fulfillment: Shipping, handling
- Payment Processing: Typically 2-3%
- Marketing Cost: Media + creative + agency
- Contribution Margin: Net Revenue - All Variable Costs

WHY GROSS MISLEADS:
Gross ROAS of 4x might become Net ROAS of 1.5x after:
- 20% returns
- 10% discounts
- 30% COGS
- 5% fulfillment
- 3% payment processing

Example Calculation:
- Gross Revenue: $100,000 (4x ROAS on $25K spend)
- Returns: -$20,000
- Discounts: -$10,000
- Net Revenue: $70,000
- COGS: -$30,000
- Fulfillment: -$5,000
- Processing: -$2,100
- Contribution: $32,900
- Media Cost: -$25,000
- Net Profit: $7,900 (Net ROAS: 1.32x)

NET SELLING MARGIN:
Formula: (Net Revenue - Variable Costs) / Net Revenue
Target: Minimum 20% after marketing for sustainability
Use: Governs maximum allowable CAC

DEFAULT STANCE:
All targets should be set on net figures. Present gross for reference only. Contribution margin is the control KPI.

WHEN TO DEVIATE:
- Client systems only provide gross data
- Adjustment factors unknown
- Early-stage company without return history
- Document assumptions, recommend data collection

AGENT BEHAVIOR:
- Ask for return rates, discount rates, COGS
- Calculate net metrics when data available
- Present gross and net side-by-side
- Flag gross-only targets as incomplete

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.4 LTV GOVERNS CAC

CORE PRINCIPLE:
No CAC target should be set without understanding Lifetime Value. LTV determines the maximum allowable acquisition investment.

THE RELATIONSHIP:
- Allowable CAC = LTV * Target Margin
- Healthy LTV:CAC Ratio = 3:1 minimum
- Aggressive LTV:CAC Ratio = 5:1 or higher
- Below 3:1 = Unsustainable acquisition

SNPV (SUBSEQUENT NET PRESENT VALUE):
Definition: Expected future value from a customer AFTER first transaction
Formula: Sum of (Future Margin per Period / (1 + Discount Rate)^Period)
Use: Justifies negative first-order economics

Example:
- First Order Margin: $30
- CAC: $75
- First Order Loss: -$45
- SNPV (3-year): $180
- Total Expected Value: $135
- LTV:CAC: 2.4:1 (marginal but viable with improvements)

PAYBACK PERIOD CONSIDERATIONS:
- Cash-constrained: Target 6-12 month payback
- Well-funded: May accept 12-24 month payback
- Venture-backed growth: May accept 24-36 month payback
- Payback = CAC / Monthly Margin Contribution

HOW TO BUILD LTV MODEL WHEN DATA IS MISSING:

SCENARIO: No historical data
- Estimate average order value (benchmark or stated)
- Estimate purchase frequency (vertical benchmark)
- Estimate customer lifespan (benchmark or 3 years default)
- Estimate margin percentage (ask or benchmark)
- Apply formula: LTV = AOV * Frequency * Lifespan * Margin
- Apply discount rate (typically 10-15%)

SCENARIO: Limited historical data
- Calculate 12-month customer value from available data
- Apply retention curves (benchmark or cohort analysis)
- Project forward with decay assumptions
- Validate against industry benchmarks

DEFAULT STANCE:
No CAC target accepted without LTV understanding or model. Agent must calculate or estimate LTV before approving acquisition targets.

WHEN TO DEVIATE:
- Pure lead generation with no revenue visibility
- Use cost-per-lead benchmarks instead
- Document LTV gap and recommend tracking

AGENT BEHAVIOR:
- Always ask about repeat purchase rates
- Calculate LTV:CAC for proposed targets
- Flag ratios below 3:1 as high risk
- Recommend LTV tracking implementation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.5 ROAS IS FLAWED

CORE PRINCIPLE:
ROAS should never be the primary KPI. It has fundamental flaws that make it misleading for optimization decisions.

THE 7 REASONS ROAS IS FLAWED:

FLAW 1: Measures Sales, Not Customers
- Repeat buyer orders inflate ROAS
- Does not distinguish incremental value
- Favors channels that reach existing customers

FLAW 2: Almost Always Calculated Wrong
- Typically uses attributed revenue, not incremental
- View-through attribution inflates numbers
- Multi-touch models vary wildly

FLAW 3: Uses Gross Figures Not Net
- Returns not subtracted
- Discounts often not adjusted
- True profitability hidden

FLAW 4: No Concept of Incrementality
- Credits media for organic conversions
- Over-values branded search
- Under-values prospecting

FLAW 5: Does Not Account for Multi-Touch
- Last-click bias is common
- First-click equally flawed
- Even multi-touch is modeled, not measured

FLAW 6: Overstates Channel Value
- Retargeting appears most efficient
- Ignores that users were already in funnel
- Creates circular optimization

FLAW 7: Ignores Time Value and Cash Flow
- Treats $100 today same as $100 in 6 months
- Does not account for collection lag
- Working capital impact ignored

PROPER ROAS CALCULATION (if required):
- Use incrementality-adjusted revenue
- Apply net revenue adjustments
- Specify attribution model
- Include time-window limitations
- Still flawed but less misleading

DEFAULT STANCE:
Challenge ROAS as primary KPI. Recommend alternatives (CAC, contribution margin, LTV:CAC). Allow if client insists but document concerns.

WHEN TO DEVIATE:
- Client explicitly understands limitations
- Internal reporting requires ROAS alignment
- Used alongside proper metrics, not alone
- E-commerce with strong repeat rates where aware of repeat inflation

AGENT BEHAVIOR:
- Present ROAS concerns proactively
- Offer alternative KPI recommendations
- If ROAS required, calculate properly
- Always pair with customer-based metrics

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.6 RIGHT CUSTOMERS > MORE CUSTOMERS

CORE PRINCIPLE:
Optimize for customers likely to deliver long-term value, not maximum customer volume. One-and-done customers drain value.

WHY ONE-AND-DONE CUSTOMERS DRAIN VALUE:
- Full CAC paid for single transaction
- Often attracted by deep discounts
- No SNPV to justify acquisition cost
- Inflate customer counts without building base

THE ECONOMICS OF TRANSACTION 2-N:
- Transaction 1: CAC paid, margin minimal or negative
- Transaction 2: No CAC, full margin captured
- Transaction 3+: Compounding value, referrals possible
- 80% of customer value often in transactions 2-N

HOW TO IDENTIFY "RIGHT" CUSTOMERS:
- Purchase at or near full price
- Multiple category purchases
- Engage with non-promotional content
- Higher average order value
- Similar to best existing customers

ACQUISITION TARGETING IMPLICATIONS:
- Lookalike audiences from high-LTV customers
- Exclude deal-seekers from acquisition targeting
- Test and measure cohort LTV, not just conversion
- Accept lower volume for higher quality

RETENTION SEGMENT PRIORITIZATION:
- High LTV, Low Risk: Maintain (low touch)
- High LTV, High Risk: Protect (high priority)
- Low LTV, Low Risk: Grow (selective investment)
- Low LTV, High Risk: Accept churn (minimal investment)

DEFAULT STANCE:
Optimize for customers likely to deliver long-term value. Volume without quality is vanity metric.

WHEN TO DEVIATE:
- Pure awareness plays measuring reach
- Market share grabs with strategic intent
- Network effects where volume drives value
- New market entry requiring critical mass

AGENT BEHAVIOR:
- Recommend quality-based targeting
- Ask about high-LTV customer profiles
- Include LTV measurement in campaign design
- Flag volume-only optimization as risky

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.7 THE CURSE OF THE COMP

CORE PRINCIPLE:
Promotion-driven growth creates false performance signals. The cycle of escalating promotions masks long-term damage.

HOW PROMOTION ADDICTION DEVELOPS:
- Slow period prompts promotional offer
- Orders increase, executives celebrate
- Post-promo period shows decline
- Next promo required to match comps
- Promo depth increases to maintain lift
- Customer base trained to wait for promos
- Full-price sales decline permanently

THE CYCLE OF ESCALATING PROMOTIONS:
- Year 1: 20% off drives 30% lift
- Year 2: 20% off drives 15% lift (trained customers)
- Year 2: 30% off required to match prior lift
- Year 3: 30% off drives 15% lift
- Year 3: 40% off + free shipping required
- Spiral continues until margins collapse

HOW SHORT-TERM REVENUE MASKS DAMAGE:
- Promotional revenue recognized immediately
- Margin erosion less visible
- Customer quality degradation delayed
- Comp pressure creates quarter-over-quarter trap
- True performance decline hidden for 2-3 years

WARNING SIGNS TO WATCH:
- Promotional sales percentage increasing
- Full-price conversion rate declining
- New customer promo dependency rising
- Repeat purchase rate declining
- Average order value decreasing
- Email open rates declining (promo fatigue)

HOW TO BREAK THE CYCLE:
- Reduce promo frequency gradually
- Shift from percent-off to value-add
- Reserve promos for strategic moments
- Build non-promotional engagement
- Accept short-term revenue decline
- Track full-price metrics separately

DEFAULT STANCE:
Warn about promotion-driven growth creating false performance signals. This is always a warning, not a rule.

AGENT BEHAVIOR:
- Flag campaigns with 30%+ discount reliance
- Recommend promotional calendaring
- Ask about full-price sales trends
- Suggest value-add alternatives to discounts

================================================================================
SECTION 2: CAMPAIGN LIFECYCLE WISDOM
================================================================================

2.1 ACQUISITION PHILOSOPHY

CORE PRINCIPLE:
Acquisition is often negative short-term ROI by design. This is an investment mindset, not a failure.

WHY ACQUISITION IS INITIALLY UNPROFITABLE:
- CAC front-loaded, LTV distributed
- First order margin often below CAC
- Investment recovers over customer lifespan
- Cash flow negative before positive

INVESTMENT MINDSET VS CASH-FLOW MINDSET:
Investment View: Pay $75 CAC for customer worth $250 LTV
Cash-Flow View: Lose $45 on first order

Both are correct. Decision depends on:
- Available capital
- Cost of capital
- Growth targets
- Payback period tolerance

LTV JUSTIFICATION FOR ACQUISITION SPEND:
Allowable CAC Calculation:
- LTV: $250
- Target Margin: 30%
- Allowable CAC: $75
- First Order Value: $30
- Acceptable First-Order Loss: $45

CUSTOMER QUALITY OVER QUANTITY:
- 1,000 low-quality customers: $50K LTV total
- 500 high-quality customers: $125K LTV total
- Same CAC investment, 2.5x value difference

TIME-OF-YEAR IMPACTS ON CUSTOMER VALUE:
- Q1 Customers: Maximum in-year value (full year ahead)
- Q2 Customers: Good in-year value
- Q3 Customers: Activate before Q4 peak
- Q4 Customers: Minimal in-year value, risk holiday-only buyers

DEFAULT STANCE:
Evaluate acquisition on LTV basis, not first-order profitability. Accept appropriate first-order loss when LTV justifies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2 RETENTION PHILOSOPHY

CORE PRINCIPLE:
Buying cycle understanding is mandatory. Do not over-message customers likely to transact anyway.

BUYING CYCLE FUNDAMENTALS:
- Every category has natural purchase frequency
- Messaging before cycle wastes impressions
- Messaging at cycle timing drives conversion
- Over-messaging creates fatigue and unsubscribes

TYPICAL CYCLES BY CATEGORY:
- Grocery: Weekly to bi-weekly
- Apparel: Monthly to quarterly
- Electronics: Annually to bi-annually
- Auto: 3-7 years
- Financial Services: Event-driven

DO NOT MESSAGE CUSTOMERS LIKELY TO BUY:
- Customer approaching natural purchase window
- Customer with item in cart
- Customer who just browsed specific product
- Exception: Competitive threat or churn risk

PROMOTION TIMING STRATEGY:
- Early cycle: No promo needed
- Mid cycle: Light engagement, no discount
- Late cycle: Stronger call to action
- Past cycle: Win-back, promo may be appropriate

KEEPING CUSTOMERS "FRESH" BEFORE PEAK:
- Q3 engagement to activate for Q4
- Light touches maintain relationship
- Avoid promo conditioning before peak
- Save promotional ammunition for peak

REACTIVATION VS RETENTION DISTINCTION:
- Retention: Active customers, maintain engagement
- Reactivation: Lapsed customers, win-back required
- Different tactics, different economics
- Reactivation often requires incentive

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.3 REACTIVATION PHILOSOPHY

CORE PRINCIPLE:
Reactivation often reactivates worst customers. Promotion responsiveness does not equal customer quality.

DEFINITION:
Reactivation targets customers inactive beyond category-appropriate period. Typically 1.5-2x normal purchase cycle.

CAUTION: REACTIVATION ATTRACTS WORST CUSTOMERS:
- Lapsed for a reason (often poor experience or price sensitivity)
- Respond to deep discounts
- Have lowest LTV of any segment
- Re-lapse quickly after reactivation
- Create false success metrics

PROMOTION RESPONSIVENESS != CUSTOMER QUALITY:
- Promo responders: Low LTV, high churn
- Full-price buyers: High LTV, low churn
- Correlation is inverse
- Reactivation campaigns optimize for wrong segment

WHEN REACTIVATION MAKES SENSE:
- Lapse due to fixable issue (now fixed)
- Product or service improvement to communicate
- Life event likely caused lapse (addressable)
- Strategic win-back of high-value lapsed
- Competitive recovery

WHEN TO LET CUSTOMERS GO:
- Multiple reactivation attempts failed
- Known bad customer (returns, complaints)
- Acquired via deep discount originally
- No engagement with multiple attempts
- Cost to reactivate exceeds expected value

DEFAULT STANCE:
Approach reactivation skeptically. Focus on preventing lapse over recovering lapsed. Accept natural churn.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.4 TIME-OF-YEAR IMPACTS

FISCAL YEAR TIMING:
- Q1 acquisition feeds full-year value
- Q2 acquisition supports second-half performance
- Q3 activation prepares for Q4 peak
- Q4 acquisition risks holiday-only customers

Q1 CUSTOMERS HAVE MAXIMUM IN-YEAR VALUE:
- Full 12 months to generate repeat purchases
- Multiple holiday windows ahead
- Most valuable acquisition period
- Often lowest CPMs (post-holiday)

Q3 ACTIVATION TO MAXIMIZE Q4:
- Re-engage dormant customers in September
- Build engagement before promotional noise
- Avoid discounting to maintain margin for Q4
- Email list hygiene before peak sending

Q4 ACQUISITION IMPACTS NEXT-YEAR MOMENTUM:
- Q4 customers may be deal-seekers
- Test for quality before scaling
- Holiday buyers may not repeat
- January is true test of Q4 acquisition quality

SEASONAL CPM VARIATIONS:
- January-February: Lowest CPMs (-20-30% from average)
- March-May: Moderate CPMs
- June-August: Moderate to high
- September-October: Rising CPMs (+10-20%)
- November-December: Peak CPMs (+30-60%)

HOLIDAY COMPETITION DYNAMICS:
- Retail advertisers dominate Q4 inventory
- B2B can find opportunity in reduced competition
- CTV premiums highest during holiday programming
- Plan alternative channels for Q4 efficiency

================================================================================
SECTION 3: AUDIENCE STRATEGY
================================================================================

3.1 MULTIPLE AUDIENCES REQUIRED

CORE PRINCIPLE:
Single-audience plans are insufficient. Each audience needs independent KPIs, budgets, and channel selection.

WHY SINGLE-AUDIENCE FAILS:
- Different segments have different values
- Blended metrics hide segment performance
- Cannot optimize without segment visibility
- Misallocates budget to low-value segments

AUDIENCE REQUIREMENTS:
- Minimum 3 audiences for any meaningful campaign
- Each audience: Defined criteria
- Each audience: Distinct KPI targets
- Each audience: Allocated budget
- Each audience: Channel selection

SHARED BASE ATTRIBUTES:
To reduce friction, all audiences should share:
- Conversion tracking setup
- Attribution methodology
- Reporting taxonomy
- Creative asset pool (with variant testing)

MINIMUM AUDIENCE COUNT RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Under $50K campaign: 2-3 audiences
- $50-200K campaign: 3-5 audiences
- Over $200K campaign: 5+ audiences
- Each audience needs sufficient budget for learning

HOW TO SEGMENT EFFECTIVELY:
- LTV-based: High, medium, low value
- Behavior-based: Engaged, lapsed, new
- Stage-based: Awareness, consideration, conversion
- Geographic: By DMA or region
- Demographic: Only if behaviorally meaningful

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2 BUYING CYCLE INTEGRATION

CORE PRINCIPLE:
Understanding average purchase cycle governs frequency caps, message timing, and budget pacing.

UNDERSTANDING PURCHASE CYCLE:
- How long between typical purchases?
- What triggers purchase consideration?
- How long is consideration phase?
- What information is sought during consideration?

FREQUENCY CAP IMPLICATIONS:
- Short cycle (weekly): Higher frequency acceptable
- Medium cycle (monthly): 3-5x monthly max
- Long cycle (quarterly+): 1-2x monthly, spike at consideration

MESSAGE TIMING OPTIMIZATION:
- Before cycle: Light awareness, no conversion pressure
- Early cycle: Education, consideration content
- Mid cycle: Differentiation, social proof
- Late cycle: Conversion offers, urgency

AVOIDING WASTED IMPRESSIONS ON IMMINENT BUYERS:
- Suppress recent converters from acquisition
- Reduce retargeting on high-intent signals
- Shift budget to new prospects post-conversion
- Re-engage after appropriate cycle gap

CYCLE LENGTH BY CATEGORY/VERTICAL:

Short Cycle (weekly-monthly):
- Grocery, convenience
- Food delivery
- Entertainment

Medium Cycle (monthly-quarterly):
- Apparel, fashion
- Beauty, personal care
- Home goods

Long Cycle (quarterly-annual):
- Electronics, appliances
- Furniture
- Financial products
- Travel

Very Long Cycle (annual+):
- Automotive
- Insurance
- Real estate
- Education

================================================================================
SECTION 4: CHANNEL STRATEGY
================================================================================

4.1 FLIGHTING STRATEGY

CORE PRINCIPLE:
Media delivery should be optimized by day, time, and frequency based on audience behavior and buying cycle.

DAY-OF-WEEK PATTERNS:
- B2B: Tuesday-Thursday highest engagement
- B2C: Thursday-Sunday for consideration
- Retail: Friday-Sunday for conversion
- Services: Monday-Tuesday for research

TIME-OF-DAY OPTIMIZATION:
- Morning: News consumption, commute mobile
- Midday: Work breaks, lunch browsing
- Afternoon: Productivity lull, social browsing
- Evening: Primetime engagement, CTV
- Late night: Impulse purchases, lower competition

FREQUENCY CAPS PER USER/ID:
- Daily cap: 2-3 exposures maximum
- Weekly cap: 8-12 exposures for consideration
- Monthly cap: Based on purchase cycle
- Sequence: Vary creative to avoid fatigue

CONTENT AND PLACEMENT BY TIMING:
- Morning: Informational, awareness content
- Midday: Snackable, quick consumption
- Evening: Longer form, consideration content
- Weekend: Lifestyle, aspiration content

BUYING CYCLE ALIGNMENT:
- Match flighting to purchase cycle phase
- Heavy up during consideration window
- Light touch during dormant phase
- Spike for seasonal or event timing

SUPPORTING MEDIA DEPTH:
- Primary channel: 60-70% of impressions
- Supporting channels: 30-40% of impressions
- Cross-channel frequency management
- Attribution across flight pattern

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.2 WORKING MEDIA VS MEDIA SPEND

CORE PRINCIPLE:
Gross media spend masks actual publisher investment. Supply chain costs significantly reduce working media.

DEFINITION:
Working Media = Gross Spend - All Fees (what actually reaches publishers)

SUPPLY CHAIN COST COMPONENTS:

DSP FEES: 10-20% of gross spend
- Platform technology fee
- Managed service fee (if applicable)
- Data processing fees

SSP FEES: 10-20% of publisher revenue
- Exchange technology fee
- Take rate varies by SSP
- Often hidden in bid mechanics

VERIFICATION FEES: 1-5% of gross spend
- Brand safety: $0.02-0.10 CPM
- Viewability: $0.02-0.04 CPM
- Fraud detection: $0.01-0.03 CPM

DATA FEES: 1-5% of gross spend
- Third-party audiences: $0.50-5.00 CPM
- First-party onboarding: $0.50-2.00 CPM
- Identity resolution: Varies

AD SERVING: 0.5-1% of gross spend
- Creative hosting
- Impression tracking
- Reporting

TYPICAL FEE STACKING:
- DSP: 15%
- SSP: 18%
- Verification: 3%
- Data: 2%
- Ad Serving: 1%
- Total: 39% fees
- Working Media: 61%

SUPPLY PATH OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES:
- Reduce intermediaries
- Direct publisher relationships
- Preferred SSP paths
- Fee negotiation
- Can improve working media by 5-15%

HOW TO CALCULATE WORKING MEDIA PERCENTAGE:
Formula: (Gross Spend - All Fees) / Gross Spend * 100
Target: 65-75% minimum
Warning: Below 65% requires SPO analysis

================================================================================
SECTION 5: MEASUREMENT REALITY
================================================================================

5.1 INCREMENTALITY TESTING APPROACHES

GEOGRAPHIC HOLDOUTS:
- Matched market methodology
- Hold out 10-20% of DMAs
- Measure conversion difference
- Minimum 4-week test window
- Best for TV, OOH, broad campaigns

AUDIENCE HOLDOUTS:
- Random audience split
- Control sees no ads (or PSA)
- Measure conversion lift
- Can run in-platform
- Best for digital campaigns

CHANNEL HOLDOUTS:
- Pause single channel
- Measure total conversion impact
- Isolate channel incrementality
- Risk optimization history loss
- Best for channel evaluation

CAMPAIGN HOLDOUTS:
- Full campaign on/off test
- Geographic or temporal
- Measure total impact
- High risk, high clarity
- Best for campaign justification

SIZING HOLDOUTS FOR STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
- Minimum detectable effect: What lift matters?
- Sample size calculator: Based on conversion rate
- Typical minimum: 10,000 users per cell
- Duration: Minimum 2-4 weeks

TESTING AS CAPITAL ALLOCATION:
- Test budget: 10-20% of total
- Learning value: Investment, not cost
- Compound learning: Each test improves next
- Test portfolio: Multiple simultaneous tests

LEARNING BUDGET PHILOSOPHY:
- Reserve 10-15% for pure testing
- Accept lower efficiency for learning
- Document and apply findings
- Build institutional knowledge

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.2 WHACK-A-MOLE TRADE-OFFS

CORE PRINCIPLE:
Optimizing one KPI almost always impacts others. Understanding trade-offs is essential.

HOW OPTIMIZING ONE KPI IMPACTS OTHERS:

OPTIMIZING FOR CAC:
- Improves: Cost efficiency
- Worsens: Volume, reach, brand awareness
- Watch: Quality may decline with efficiency

OPTIMIZING FOR VOLUME:
- Improves: Customer count, market share
- Worsens: CAC, quality, margin
- Watch: Diminishing returns at scale

OPTIMIZING FOR ROAS:
- Improves: Short-term efficiency
- Worsens: Incrementality, new customer ratio
- Watch: Favors existing customers

OPTIMIZING FOR REACH:
- Improves: Awareness, brand metrics
- Worsens: CAC, conversion efficiency
- Watch: Frequency may suffer

COMMON TRADE-OFF PAIRS:
- Volume vs Efficiency (always in tension)
- Quality vs Quantity (inverse relationship)
- Short-term vs Long-term (payback tension)
- Reach vs Frequency (budget constraint)
- Brand vs Performance (attribution tension)

MONITORING DASHBOARD REQUIREMENTS:
- Track all KPIs, not just optimization target
- Visualize trade-offs over time
- Alert on degradation thresholds
- Show composite health score

DECISION FRAMEWORKS WHEN KPIS CONFLICT:
- Primary KPI governs (pre-declared)
- Constraint KPIs set boundaries
- Within constraints, optimize primary
- Review constraints periodically

ACCEPTING TRADE-OFFS EXPLICITLY:
- Document expected trade-offs in plan
- Set acceptable ranges for secondary KPIs
- Review actuals against expectations
- Adjust strategy based on actual trade-offs

================================================================================
SECTION 6: COMMON PITFALLS
================================================================================

6.1 FALSE PERFORMANCE SIGNALS

PROMOTION-DRIVEN GROWTH ILLUSIONS:
- Spike looks like success
- Actually borrowed from future
- Masked declining baseline
- Customers trained to wait

DEMAND PULL-FORWARD EFFECTS:
- Promotions accelerate purchases
- Post-promo period shows decline
- No net incremental demand
- Just temporal shift

HOW TO DETECT FALSE SIGNALS:
- Compare rolling averages, not point-in-time
- Track non-promotional baseline separately
- Measure same-store (same-audience) growth
- Look at customer quality, not just orders

ATTRIBUTION OVER-CREDIT:
- Platform attribution favors platform
- View-through inflates display/video
- Brand search gets credit for brand awareness
- Retargeting credits funnel, not itself

MULTI-TOUCH CONFUSION:
- Different models give different answers
- All models are wrong
- Some models are useful
- Use directionally, not absolutely

================================================================================
SECTION 7: WHEN TO DEVIATE
================================================================================

7.1 CLIENT CONSTRAINT HANDLING

WHEN CLIENT CANNOT PROVIDE LTV DATA:
- Build model from basics
- Use vertical benchmarks
- Estimate conservatively
- Recommend data collection
- Document assumptions

WHEN INCREMENTALITY TESTING NOT FEASIBLE:
- Budget too small: Use platform lift studies
- Duration too short: Use historical comparison
- No control possible: Use time-series analysis
- Document limitation and recommendation

WHEN CLIENT INSISTS ON ROAS:
- Allow with documented concerns
- Calculate properly (net, incremental)
- Pair with customer metrics
- Set realistic targets
- Review quarterly for issues

WHEN GROSS DATA IS ALL AVAILABLE:
- Apply estimated adjustment factors
- Use conservative assumptions
- Recommend data improvement
- Track gross and flag

GENERAL PRINCIPLE:
Excellent should not block good. Make progress with available data while recommending improvements.
