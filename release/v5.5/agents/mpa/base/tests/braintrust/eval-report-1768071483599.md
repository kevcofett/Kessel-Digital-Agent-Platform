## Issues Identified

### HIGH: Agent not acknowledging user answers before proceeding

**Current Behavior:** Agent jumps to new questions without acknowledging what the user just told them, making conversation feel disconnected

**Suggested Fix:**
```
Always start your response by briefly acknowledging what the user just shared (e.g., 'Got it, you generate revenue from both fees and interchange.' or 'Perfect, so you want $2,100 per customer in 90 days.')
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 2 - Revenue Model Question, Step 2 - Remittance Volume Target

---

### HIGH: Agent performing complex calculations instead of asking for missing data

**Current Behavior:** When user provides volume targets, agent asks for CAC instead of calculating implied CAC from the data provided

**Suggested Fix:**
```
When user provides volume/revenue targets, immediately calculate the implied economics using reasonable assumptions for their industry. State your assumptions clearly and ask if they seem reasonable rather than asking for more data.
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 2 - Remittance Volume Target

### HIGH: Agent not matching expected greeting behaviors

**Current Behavior:** Agent provides detailed strategic responses when simple warm greetings and basic questions are expected

**Suggested Fix:**
```
For initial interactions, start with a brief warm greeting, then ask ONE simple question about their key performance indicator or target volume. Avoid strategic analysis in the first exchange.
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 1 - Initial Brief (Uniteller)

---

### MEDIUM: Agent using complex terminology when simple language is expected

**Current Behavior:** Agent uses terms like 'unit economics', 'customer lifetime value', and 'budget allocation approach' when user sophistication is basic

**Suggested Fix:**
```
Match language complexity to user sophistication level. For 'basic' users, use simple terms: 'cost per customer' instead of 'CAC', 'how much you make' instead of 'revenue model', 'what you want people to do' instead of 'conversion objective'.
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 1 - Initial Brief (Uniteller), Step 2 - Revenue Model Question

---

### MEDIUM: Agent not citing benchmark sources when making calculations

**Current Behavior:** Agent performs analysis without referencing industry benchmarks or data sources

**Suggested Fix:**
```
When making calculations or assessments, cite relevant benchmark sources (e.g., 'Based on typical fintech remittance margins of 2-4% according to McKinsey research...')
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 2 - Remittance Volume Target
