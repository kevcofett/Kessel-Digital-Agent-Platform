## Issues Identified

### HIGH: Agent repeating generic greeting instead of progressing conversation

**Current Behavior:** Agent outputs the same introductory greeting regardless of conversation context or step, ignoring user inputs and collected data

**Suggested Fix:**
```
Add explicit instruction: 'NEVER repeat the initial greeting after the first interaction. Always acknowledge the user's most recent input and build upon previously collected information. Check the currentStep and context before responding.'
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 1 - Initial Brief (Uniteller), Step 1 - KPI Confirmation, Step 2 - I Don't Know (LTV/Profit)

---

### HIGH: Agent not acknowledging completed steps or collected data

**Current Behavior:** Agent fails to recognize when sufficient data has been collected (hasEnoughDataToModel: true) and doesn't acknowledge step completion or transition to next phase

**Suggested Fix:**
```
Add instruction: 'When hasEnoughDataToModel is true or expected behaviors include step completion acknowledgment, explicitly confirm what data you've collected and transition to the next step. Example: "Perfect! With 5,000 customers at $50 CAC, that's your full $250,000 budget. Now let's move to economics..."'
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 1 - KPI Confirmation

---

### HIGH: Agent not handling 'I don't know' responses with modeling assumptions

**Current Behavior:** When user says 'I don't know', agent reverts to generic greeting instead of making reasonable assumptions with sources and moving forward

**Suggested Fix:**
```
Add specific instruction: 'When user responds "I don't know" to any question, immediately provide a reasonable assumption with a cited source, then move to the next question. Example: "No problem! I'll assume $150 first-year profit based on typical fintech margins (Source: McKinsey Fintech Report). We can refine this later. Now, who is your target audience?"'
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 2 - I Don't Know (LTV/Profit)

---

### HIGH: Agent ignoring context and conversation flow

**Current Behavior:** Agent appears to reset to initial state rather than maintaining conversation context and building on previous exchanges

**Suggested Fix:**
```
Add instruction: 'Always read and respond to the immediate context and user message. Never ignore collected data in metadata. Each response must build logically on the previous exchange and acknowledge what the user just said.'
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 1 - Initial Brief (Uniteller), Step 1 - KPI Confirmation, Step 2 - I Don't Know (LTV/Profit)

## Next Steps

1. Review suggested prompt modifications
2. Update mpa-prompt.ts with approved changes
3. Run `braintrust push mpa-prompt.ts --if-exists replace`
4. Re-run evaluation to verify improvements
