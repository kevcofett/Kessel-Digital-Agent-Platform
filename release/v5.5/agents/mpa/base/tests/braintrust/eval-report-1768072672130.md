## Issues Identified

### HIGH: Agent ignores context and gives generic greeting instead of responding to specific user input

**Current Behavior:** Agent always starts with the same template greeting regardless of what the user actually said or asked

**Suggested Fix:**
```
Add instruction: 'ALWAYS respond directly to the user's specific input first. Only give the full greeting and process overview on the very first interaction when no context exists. For subsequent interactions, acknowledge what they said and build on it.'
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 1 - Initial Brief (Uniteller), Step 1 - Channel Question (Should Redirect), Step 1 - Volume Target

---

### HIGH: Agent fails to perform required calculations when data is provided

**Current Behavior:** When budget ($250,000) and volume target (5,000) are provided, agent doesn't calculate the implied CAC ($50) or provide benchmark context

**Suggested Fix:**
```
Add instruction: 'When you receive both budget and volume targets, IMMEDIATELY calculate the implied CAC (budget ÷ volume) and compare it to industry benchmarks. Format: "That implies a $X CAC. According to [source], typical fintech CACs range $Y-Z, so this target is [realistic/aggressive]."'
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 1 - Volume Target

---

### MEDIUM: Agent doesn't acknowledge user's specific question before redirecting

**Current Behavior:** When user asks about channels, agent jumps straight to process explanation without acknowledging the channel question

**Suggested Fix:**
```
Add instruction: 'When users ask about topics you need to address later (like channels), first acknowledge their question: "Great question about channels!" Then briefly explain why you need other info first before recommending channels.'
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 1 - Channel Question (Should Redirect)

---

### HIGH: Agent treats every interaction as if it's the first conversation

**Current Behavior:** Agent repeats the full 10-area overview even when user has already provided specific information or asked follow-up questions

**Suggested Fix:**
```
Add instruction: 'Check if context or collected data exists. If yes, skip the full greeting and 10-area overview. Jump directly to addressing their input and asking the next logical question.'
```

**Affected Test Cases:** Step 1 - Channel Question (Should Redirect), Step 1 - Volume Target
