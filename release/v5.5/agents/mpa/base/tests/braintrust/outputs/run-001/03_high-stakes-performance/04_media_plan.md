# Media Plan Output: High-Stakes Performance Campaign

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect starting point - you've given me strong foundation data. Let me quickly model what you've shared:

$2M ÷ 50,000 = $40 per merchant acquisition
At $850 LTV, that's a 21.25x LTV/CAC ratio - extremely healthy efficiency.

Before we dive deeper into the economics, I want to clarify your primary business outcome. When you say "acquire 50,000 new merchants" - are you focused on total merchant sign-ups, or merchants who reach a specific activation threshold like processing their first $1,000 in transactions?

This distinction affects how we structure attribution and optimize campaigns.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 3:
Great context. Let me validate your LTV math:
$45K monthly × 2.8% = $1,260 annual revenue per merchant
Over 3 years = $3,780 total revenue per merchant

Your $850 LTV suggests roughly 22% contribution margin after processing costs, ops, and support - that's realistic for your segment.

The 21x LTV/CAC ratio IS aggressive. High-performing fintech typically sees 8-12x ratios, with exceptional cases hitting 15x. Your target requires extremely tight execution.

Here's what concerns me: if retention assumptions prove optimistic (common with fast-scaling fintechs), your actual LTV could be closer to $600-700. That would put you at 15-17x ratio - still ambitious but more defensible.

Two quick economics questions:
1. Do you have cohort data showing actual 12-month retention rates?
2. What's driving the pressure for such aggressive efficiency - is this purely ARR targets or also profitability constraints?

Understanding this helps me recommend the right risk level for channel mix and audience targeting.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Excellent clarification - focusing on activated merchants is much smarter than vanity sign-ups. Your 60% activation rate gives us a clear conversion funnel to model.

Let me recalculate with the activation reality:
- 83,000 sign-ups needed → $2M ÷ 83,000 = $24 cost per sign-up
- 50,000 activated merchants → $2M ÷ 50,000 = $40 cost per activated merchant

That $40 CAC against $850 LTV maintains your strong 21.25x ratio.

Now for the critical economics question: What's your average take rate on merchant transactions? For payment platforms, I typically see 2-3%, but knowing your specific rate helps me validate whether that $850 LTV calculation accounts for realistic transaction volumes and retention patterns.

This affects whether your efficiency target is conservative, typical, or aggressive for fintech merchant acquisition.

Turn 4:
That's the classic Series B squeeze - growth AND efficiency simultaneously. Your 75% 12-month retention from smaller cohorts is solid, but you're wise to worry about retention at scale with less hands-on touch.

Let me model a more conservative scenario:
If retention drops to 65% at scale and average lifespan becomes 2.5 years:
$1,260 annual revenue × 2.5 years × 22% margin = ~$693 LTV

That would put you at 17.3x LTV/CAC - still aggressive but more realistic for board presentations.

Given the board pressure and tight efficiency requirements, we need a precision-focused strategy. This means:
- Extremely tight audience targeting (likely 20-30 audience signals)
- Heavy emphasis on lookalike audiences from your best merchants
- Rigorous incrementality testing since platform ROAS will inflate

Quick transition question: Do you have a solid first-party data foundation? Specifically, can you export your highest-value activated merchants for lookalike modeling, and do you have enough volume for meaningful lookalikes across major platforms?

This determines whether we can hit your aggressive targets or need contingency planning.

Turn 5:
Perfect - 12,000 activated merchants is excellent seed data, and service-based businesses are ideal because they have predictable cash flow and lower churn than retail.

Your first-party advantage changes everything. Lookalike audiences from high-value merchants typically outperform cold prospecting by 40-60%, which is exactly what you need to hit that aggressive $40 CAC target.

With your strong data foundation established, let's move to audience definition. Given your $2M budget and precision requirements, we need laser-focused targeting.

Your best merchants are service-based businesses (contractors, consultants, agencies) processing $10K-100K monthly. To build the tightest possible audiences:

What are the 3-4 most specific business types within that service category that show the highest LTV and fastest activation? For example, are HVAC contractors better than general contractors, or do marketing agencies activate faster than accounting firms?

This granularity determines whether we build 3-4 highly specific lookalike audiences or one broader service-business lookalike.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent segmentation - that gives us a clear targeting hierarchy. Marketing agencies and IT consultants are perfect for aggressive CAC targets since they activate quickly and process consistently.

For your $2M budget, I'd recommend building separate lookalike audiences for each tier:
- Tier 1: Marketing agencies + IT consultants (fastest activation)
- Tier 2: Commercial contractors (solid volume)
- Tier 3: Professional services (retention play)

We'd weight budget heavily toward Tier 1 for your aggressive targets, with Tier 2 as volume support and Tier 3 as a longer-term efficiency play.

Now for geography - this affects both audience size and competitive dynamics. Are you targeting nationwide, or do you have geographic constraints? Payment platforms often see regional clustering, especially for contractors who work locally.

Also, are there any states or metros where you already have strong merchant density that could serve as expansion bases?

Turn 8:
Perfect positioning - "processing payments in 24-48 hours vs. weeks" is a compelling rational differentiator, especially for service businesses who need immediate cash flow.

That value prop works beautifully for your target audiences:
- Marketing agencies: Need to bill retainers quickly to maintain cash flow
- IT consultants: Often project-based, need fast payment setup between clients
- Commercial contractors: Cash flow critical, can't wait weeks for payment processing

The "get paid faster + look professional" combination gives us both rational proof points and emotional resonance.

Now let's structure your $2M budget. Based on everything we've covered:

**Geographic Split:**
- $1.4M core metros (70%) - proven $40 CAC performance
- $600K expansion markets (30%) - testing cheaper CPMs

**Audience Priority:**
- 50% marketing agencies + IT consultants (fast activation)
- 30% commercial contractors (volume support)  
- 20% professional services (retention play)

Does this allocation align with your growth priorities, or would you weight differently between audience tiers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Smart geographic strategy - that 70/30 split leverages your proven markets while testing expansion. The network effect you're seeing is gold for payment platforms, especially with contractors who work together on projects.

Your core metros (NYC, LA, Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta) likely have higher CPMs but proven conversion paths. The expansion markets (Austin, Denver, Nashville, Southeast) offer cheaper media costs but unknown activation rates.

Given your aggressive $40 CAC target, this geographic approach is crucial:
- Core metros: Higher confidence in hitting efficiency targets
- Expansion markets: Potential for better-than-modeled performance if conversion rates hold

Before we dive into budget allocation across these markets, let me understand your value proposition positioning. When marketing agencies or IT consultants are evaluating payment platforms, what's your key differentiator?

Is it pricing/rates, ease of integration, specific features, or something else? This determines whether we lead with rational benefits (save money, integrate faster) or emotional benefits (grow your business, professional image).

Your messaging strategy directly impacts which channels will be most effective.
