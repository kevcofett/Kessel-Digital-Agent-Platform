# Media Plan Output: Full 10-Step Media Planning

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your business outcome. You mentioned acquiring 15,000 new customers - is customer acquisition your primary objective, or are you also focused on revenue growth, brand awareness, or retention alongside new customer acquisition?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Customer acquisition is your primary objective with 15,000 new customers as your success target. 

Now let's check if your efficiency target is realistic. Your budget breakdown: $750K / 15,000 customers = $50 per customer acquisition cost. 

For home decor and furniture e-commerce, this is quite aggressive. Industry benchmarks typically show $75-150 acquisition costs for this vertical, depending on average order value. To hit $50 per customer, we'll need very tight audience targeting and channel efficiency.

What's your average customer value? For example, does a typical customer spend $200 on their first order, or do they purchase multiple times over the year for a higher total value?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Great data! At $450 LTV and $50 target acquisition cost, that projects to a 9x LTV/CAC ratio - which is exceptionally strong if achievable.

However, you're right to question the realism. At typical home decor benchmarks of $75-150 CAC:
- $75 CAC = 10,000 customers (6x LTV/CAC ratio)
- $100 CAC = 7,500 customers (4.5x LTV/CAC ratio)  
- $150 CAC = 5,000 customers (3x LTV/CAC ratio)

All of these ratios are healthy for your business. The 3-6x range is considered strong performance.

To hit your original 15,000 target at realistic efficiency, you'd need roughly $1.1-1.5M budget.

Given your $750K budget and $450 LTV economics, I'd recommend targeting 7,500-10,000 customers as a more achievable goal. This gives us room for effective audience targeting without requiring perfect execution.

Would you prefer to adjust the customer target to match your budget, or explore if there's flexibility in the budget to support higher volume?

Turn 4:
Excellent strategic thinking! Let's model at 8,500 customers as our target - right in that sweet spot.

$750K / 8,500 customers = $88 per customer acquisition cost. This sits comfortably within industry benchmarks and gives you a healthy 5.1x LTV/CAC ratio ($450 / $88).

This efficiency target is definitely achievable with solid execution, and you're absolutely right about preferring realistic success over stretched failure.

Now that we have solid economics established, let's move to audience definition. For home decor and furniture, precision targeting will be crucial to hit that $88 efficiency.

Who is your ideal customer? Think beyond demographics - what behaviors, interests, or life situations make someone most likely to purchase home decor and furniture online?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Perfect audience definition! You've identified strong behavioral and contextual signals that go well beyond basic demographics.

Let me organize your key targeting signals:

**Demographics:** Ages 30-55, homeowners, $60K+ household income

**Life Stage Triggers:** New home purchase, marriage, new parents, empty nesters

**Behavioral:** Active on Pinterest/Instagram, seeks design inspiration, values convenience, room-by-room renovators

**Purchase Patterns:** Seasonal refreshers (holidays, spring), style + value conscious

**Psychographics:** Busy professionals, quality-focused, online shopping preference

This gives us multiple targeting layers to work with across channels. The life transition triggers are particularly valuable - those moments create high purchase intent.

One key question: Do you have first-party data on your existing customers that could help us refine these signals further? For example, purchase history, email engagement, or website behavior data we could use for lookalike modeling?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
That's actually more data than many companies have to work with! Your 25,000 email subscribers with good engagement is a solid foundation for lookalike modeling, and purchase history showing dining room furniture and seasonal decor preferences gives us clear category signals.

Given your data situation, here's what we can leverage immediately:
- Email subscriber list for lookalike audiences (high-value seed audience)
- Purchase history for category-specific targeting
- Website visitor data for retargeting and behavioral signals

The sophisticated segmentation can be a Phase 2 optimization - we'll start with what's available and refine as we gather more performance data.

Now let's talk geography. Are you targeting nationally, or do you focus on specific regions? Also, are there any shipping limitations or areas where your products perform particularly well that should influence our geographic strategy?

Turn 7:
Perfect - US-focused with strength in major metros and suburbs makes complete sense for your target audience and product mix.

Your strong performance in Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, and Pacific Northwest suggests we should prioritize similar markets: growing metro areas with high homeownership rates and your target demographics. This geographic focus will help optimize our $88 CAC target by concentrating spend where conversion rates are historically higher.

Now let's finalize budget allocation. We have $750K total for 8,500 customers at $88 CAC. 

I typically recommend holding 10-15% as a flexibility reserve for optimization shifts and unexpected opportunities. That would mean:
- $637K-675K for active media spend
- $75K-113K flexibility reserve

Does this allocation approach work for your planning, or do you prefer to allocate the full $750K upfront across channels?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Perfect value proposition! "Curated, on-trend pieces at accessible prices" with room-by-room collections that remove decorating guesswork - that's a compelling positioning for your target audience of busy professionals.

Your key differentiators:
- **Trend Authority:** Buyers stay ahead of design trends
- **Accessible Premium:** Better than budget, more affordable than high-end
- **Simplified Selection:** Room collections eliminate guesswork
- **Risk Reduction:** Free shipping over $75, generous returns

This value prop will be crucial for creative messaging and channel selection. The "no interior designer needed" angle particularly resonates with your busy professional audience.

Now for channels. Given your $78 active CAC target, audience profile, and value proposition, I'm thinking a mix that leverages both your strong first-party data and the visual nature of home decor.

What channels have you used before, and which ones performed best? Also, are there any channels you've been curious about but haven't tried yet?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
Excellent decision! $660K active spend with $90K flexibility reserve gives you exactly the agility successful campaigns need.

So we have: $660K active media / 8,500 customers = $78 per customer on active spend, with that $90K reserve available when we find winning combinations.

Now let's define your value proposition. When your ideal customer is comparing home decor options - whether online or in-store - what makes them choose HomeStyle Decor over competitors? 

Think about the key reasons customers pick you: is it product selection, pricing, quality, convenience, style curation, or something else that sets you apart?

Turn 10:
Excellent channel foundation! Your experience perfectly aligns with what works for home decor.

Google's consistency makes sense - high intent search converts well at reasonable costs. Facebook/Instagram's visual strength is right for your products, but the targeting inconsistency is common and fixable with your better first-party data.

Pinterest is absolutely worth testing for your vertical. Home decor performs exceptionally well there since users are actively seeking design inspiration. It's often more efficient than Facebook for home/lifestyle brands.

Connected TV could work for brand building, but at your $78 CAC target, we need to prioritize direct response channels first.

Here's my recommended channel mix for your $660K active spend:
- **Google Ads: 45%** ($297K) - Your proven performer
- **Facebook/Instagram: 35%** ($231K) - Visual strength with better targeting
- **Pinterest: 15%** ($99K) - Test the inspiration channel
- **Email/Retention: 5%** ($33K) - Support your existing base

This keeps 80% in channels you know while testing Pinterest at meaningful scale. Does this allocation feel right for your comfort level?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 11:
Great question! That $33K for email/retention is primarily for existing customer reactivation and repeat purchases, not new acquisition. Think of it as protecting your investment in those 8,500 new customers.

For retention channels, email is definitely the best starting point given your 25K subscriber base and good engagement rates. SMS and loyalty programs can be powerful, but they require more infrastructure setup and ongoing management.

With your budget and objectives, I'd allocate that $33K as:
- **Email campaigns: $25K** - Seasonal promotions, new product launches, win-back campaigns
- **Retention testing: $8K** - Small tests of SMS or other retention tactics

The key insight: every retained customer reduces pressure on acquisition. If that retention spend helps you keep even 200 customers who might have churned, it effectively "creates" acquisition capacity.

Now let's talk measurement. You mentioned Google has been most consistent - what metrics are you currently tracking to determine that? Are you measuring last-click attribution, looking at assisted conversions, or using another approach?

Turn 12:
You're absolutely right about under-crediting upper-funnel efforts! Last-click attribution typically over-credits Google (bottom-funnel) and under-credits Facebook/Instagram/Pinterest (upper-funnel awareness).

For your multi-channel plan, this attribution gap could lead to budget misallocation. Here's what I recommend:

**Primary KPIs:**
- **Blended CAC across all channels** - Your true $78 target
- **New customer count** - Your 8,500 goal
- **30-day and 90-day revenue per customer** - Validates LTV assumptions

**Attribution approach:**
- **Platform native reporting** for optimization (what you're doing now)
- **Google Analytics 4 data-driven attribution** - Better than last-click
- **Monthly holdout tests** - The gold standard for incrementality

Start with GA4's improved attribution while planning holdout tests for Q2. This gives you better cross-channel visibility without perfect being the enemy of good.

The key insight: measure blended performance while optimizing within platforms. If your overall $78 CAC holds, individual channel efficiency variations matter less.

Does this measurement approach feel manageable to implement alongside the campaign launch?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 10: Risks

Turn 13:
Perfect! You're thinking like a true performance marketer - implementation that builds momentum rather than creating roadblocks.

Now let's talk testing strategy. With Pinterest as your new channel and questions about Facebook/Instagram attribution, we need a testing framework that generates learnings quickly.

Here's what I recommend for your first 90 days:

**Month 1-2: Baseline establishment**
- Launch all channels with conservative targeting
- Focus on data collection and initial optimization

**Month 2-3: Systematic testing**
- Pinterest: Test 3-4 different campaign types (shopping, awareness, traffic)
- Facebook/Instagram: Test your refined first-party data audiences vs. current targeting
- Google: Test expanded match vs. exact match for your top keywords

**Key testing principle:** One variable at a time, with clear success metrics.

What's your biggest concern or uncertainty going into this plan? Is it Pinterest performance, the attribution challenges, or something else that keeps you up at night about this media strategy?
