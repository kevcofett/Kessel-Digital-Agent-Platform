USER:
I'm the Director of Performance Marketing at LuxeFinance, a wealth management firm. We need to build a precision media plan to acquire high-net-worth individuals - specifically people with $1M+ in investable assets, typically 45-65, executives and business owners who are either approaching retirement or have a major liquidity event coming up. We're interested in people researching tax optimization and estate planning. Budget is $1.5M, targeting 2,500 qualified leads. We have CRM data on 50K existing clients we can use for modeling. Focus on top DMAs by HNW concentration - NYC, SF, LA, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Denver, Miami, Dallas, DC. Quality matters more than volume here.

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a precision media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Your brief shows sophisticated planning - targeting HNW individuals with $1M+ investable assets in top DMAs with a $1.5M budget for 2,500 qualified leads.

$1.5M ÷ 2,500 = $600 per qualified lead. That's aggressive but achievable for HNW targeting given the asset thresholds and life stage precision you've described.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 2,500 qualified leads? Are you optimizing for AUM conversion, client onboarding velocity, or pipeline value creation?

TURN 2 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're primarily focused on AUM conversion - our sales team has been pushing for higher quality leads that actually convert to managed assets rather than just initial consultations. The $600 CPL is definitely aggressive, but given our average client brings in $2.5M in AUM and our fee structure, we can justify the investment if we're hitting the right prospects. Pipeline value creation is secondary - we'd rather have fewer leads that convert at higher asset levels than volume plays that waste our relationship managers' time.

AGENT:
Perfect - AUM conversion with quality over volume aligns with your $600 CPL investment. With $2.5M average AUM and wealth management fees, that efficiency becomes highly defensible.

Your primary KPI should be qualified leads that convert to AUM, but I need to understand your conversion funnel. What percentage of qualified leads typically convert to managed assets? And what's your definition of "qualified" - is it asset verification, needs assessment completion, or meeting attendance?

This conversion rate is critical because it determines if your $600 CPL translates to viable client acquisition costs.

TURN 3 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Honestly, our conversion tracking has been pretty fragmented - we're working on cleaning that up. Best estimate is around 15-20% of qualified leads convert to managed assets, but that's based on incomplete data. Our definition of qualified is someone who completes our initial assessment form with verified assets over $1M and books a consultation with one of our wealth advisors. We've been loose on lead qualification in the past, which is why our relationship managers are frustrated with lead quality.

AGENT:
Got it. I'll model using 18% conversion (mid-range of your estimate) with the caveat that improving lead qualification could significantly impact this rate. You can refine as tracking improves.

At 18% conversion: 2,500 qualified leads × 18% = 450 new AUM clients
$1.5M ÷ 450 = $3,333 per AUM client

With $2.5M average AUM per client, that's a 0.13% client acquisition cost relative to assets under management - extremely efficient for wealth management.

However, this assumes your current 18% conversion rate. Given your focus on precision targeting and improved qualification, we should build the plan to potentially drive higher conversion rates.

What's the typical timeline from qualified lead to AUM conversion? This affects how we structure nurturing and attribution windows.

TURN 4 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
The timeline varies quite a bit depending on the complexity of their situation. For straightforward cases - maybe someone who just sold their business and needs immediate wealth management - we're seeing 30-45 days from first consultation to AUM onboarding. But for more complex estate planning situations or people who are still in research mode, it can stretch to 6-9 months. Our relationship managers tell me the average is probably around 90 days, but the higher-value clients tend to take longer since they're usually more sophisticated and do more due diligence.

AGENT:
Excellent context. The 90-day average with longer cycles for higher-value clients is typical for wealth management. This means we need attribution windows that capture the full conversion cycle, and your $3,333 client acquisition cost gets even more attractive when factoring in the extended LTV relationship.

Now let's assess if your $600 CPL target is realistic. Based on wealth management benchmarks, HNW lead generation typically runs $400-$1,200 per qualified lead depending on precision. Your $600 target sits in the achievable range, especially with your 50K client CRM for lookalike modeling.

The key will be tight audience definition and channel efficiency. Given the 6-9 month research cycles for complex cases, we'll need channels that can maintain engagement throughout extended consideration periods.

Your economics look solid: $600 CPL → 18% conversion → $3,333 CAC against $2.5M AUM. Ready to move into audience precision?

TURN 5 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Yes, let's dive into audience precision. The extended consideration periods are exactly why we need to get the targeting right from the start - we can't afford to nurture unqualified prospects for 6-9 months. Our first-party data from existing clients shows some clear behavioral signals we should be able to leverage for lookalike modeling, and I'm particularly interested in how we can layer in intent data around tax optimization and estate planning research to catch people earlier in their decision-making process.

AGENT:
Perfect - your 50K client CRM gives us a significant targeting advantage, and layering intent signals will help capture prospects early in their 6-9 month research cycles.

For precision HNW targeting, we need 15-20 audience signals minimum given your aggressive $600 CPL target. Let's start with your strongest first-party signals.

From your existing 50K clients, what are the 3-4 most predictive characteristics that separate your highest-value AUM clients from lower performers? For example: specific industries, company size, geographic concentration, age ranges, or behavioral patterns in your CRM?

These core signals become our lookalike foundation before we layer in intent data around tax optimization and estate planning research.

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 6 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Looking at our highest-performing clients, the strongest predictive signals are definitely industry concentration - we see outsized success with tech executives, private equity partners, and healthcare practice owners. Company size matters too - our best clients typically come from companies with 100+ employees or are founders/C-suite at mid-market firms. 

Geographically, we're seeing much higher AUM per client in the SF Bay Area and Seattle tech corridors versus other DMAs, probably due to equity compensation and liquidity events. Age-wise, the sweet spot is really 50-62 - old enough to have accumulated significant assets but young enough to need active wealth management rather than just preservation strategies. Our CRM shows these clients also tend to have multiple financial touchpoints - existing relationships with CPAs, estate attorneys, or business brokers, which suggests they're already thinking strategically about their wealth.

AGENT:
Excellent - those are highly predictive signals for wealth management targeting. Tech executives, PE partners, and healthcare practice owners in the 50-62 age range with equity compensation patterns and existing professional advisor relationships.

The SF Bay Area and Seattle outperformance makes perfect sense given liquidity events and equity comp concentration.

For intent layering, you mentioned tax optimization and estate planning research. Are you seeing specific search behaviors or content consumption patterns that indicate someone is approaching a liquidity event or major wealth transition? For example: business valuation research, tax planning content, "selling my company" searches, or retirement planning tools?

These intent signals will help us catch prospects 3-6 months before they actively seek wealth management, giving us first-mover advantage in those extended consideration cycles.

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 7 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're seeing some clear patterns in our analytics. The strongest intent signals are around business exit planning - searches for "business valuation," "selling company tax implications," and "liquidity event planning" are huge predictors. Estate planning content consumption is another big one, especially around "generation-skipping trusts" and "charitable remainder trusts" which indicates sophisticated wealth planning needs.

Tax optimization research spikes during certain periods - we see increased activity around "tax loss harvesting," "charitable giving strategies," and "1031 exchanges" especially in Q4 when people are doing year-end planning. The interesting thing is we're also seeing engagement with content around "executive compensation planning" and "stock option strategies" which suggests people who are still building wealth but thinking ahead.

Our content team has been tracking which pieces drive the highest-quality leads, and anything related to "preparing for retirement sale" or "maximizing business exit value" converts extremely well for us.

AGENT:
Outstanding intent mapping - those signals perfectly align with your target's wealth transition moments. Business exit planning, sophisticated estate strategies, and executive compensation research are all high-intent indicators for your services.

The Q4 tax optimization surge gives us clear seasonality patterns to leverage, and the "preparing for retirement sale" content performance validates you're capturing prospects at the right moment in their wealth journey.

Now for geographic precision: You mentioned SF Bay Area and Seattle outperform, but you're targeting 10 DMAs total. Should we weight budget allocation toward the higher-performing markets, or do you need presence across all markets for relationship manager coverage?

Also, within each DMA, are there specific zip codes or neighborhoods where your highest-value clients concentrate? HNW targeting often benefits from hyper-local precision rather than broad metro targeting.

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 8 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We should definitely weight toward the higher-performing markets - I'd say allocate 40-45% of budget to SF Bay Area and Seattle since that's where we're seeing the best AUM per client ratios. The other DMAs need presence for our relationship manager coverage, but we can be more efficient there.

For hyper-local targeting, absolutely. In SF we're seeing concentration in Palo Alto, Los Altos, Saratoga - basically the Peninsula tech money. Seattle it's Bellevue, Medina, Mercer Island. In NYC it's Upper East Side, Tribeca, and certain Westchester suburbs. Our CRM shows clear clustering patterns that we should leverage - these prospects want advisors who understand their peer networks and local market dynamics.

AGENT:
Perfect geographic strategy. 40-45% to SF Bay/Seattle captures your highest-performing markets, with hyper-local precision in those wealth concentration zones.

$600K-$675K to SF Peninsula (Palo Alto, Los Altos, Saratoga) and Seattle Eastside (Bellevue, Medina, Mercer Island) with the remaining $825K-$900K distributed across the other 8 DMAs for relationship manager coverage.

Your audience precision is strong: tech executives/PE partners/healthcare practice owners, age 50-62, in wealth-concentrated zip codes, with business exit/estate planning intent signals, layered on 50K client lookalikes.

Now let's confirm your $1.5M budget allocation. Is this purely media spend, or does it include creative production, landing page development, and campaign management? Understanding the true media allocation affects our $600 CPL feasibility.

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 9 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
The $1.5M is pure media spend - we've got separate budget lines for creative production and campaign management through our agency. We're planning to refresh our creative assets anyway since our current materials are too generic for this precision targeting approach. Landing page development might need some additional investment to create specific experiences for the different intent signals we discussed, but that would come from our digital infrastructure budget, not the media allocation.

So we should be able to hit that $600 CPL target with the full $1.5M going toward media placement. The question is whether we can generate enough qualified volume in those hyper-targeted zip codes without driving up costs through over-concentration.

AGENT:
Excellent - pure media spend gives us full $1.5M for placement, making the $600 CPL much more achievable.

Your concern about volume concentration is valid. HNW audiences in those zip codes are finite, and over-targeting can drive up costs through auction competition and frequency saturation.

Based on your targeting precision and geographic concentration, I estimate your total addressable audience across all DMAs at roughly 75K-100K individuals. To generate 2,500 qualified leads, you need approximately 3% response rate from your addressable audience - aggressive but feasible with your intent layering and lookalike modeling.

The key will be channel diversification to avoid over-saturating any single platform's HNW inventory. We'll likely need a mix that includes LinkedIn for professional targeting, programmatic for geographic precision, search for intent capture, and possibly direct mail for the ultra-targeted zip codes.

What's your value proposition messaging strategy for these sophisticated prospects who likely receive multiple wealth management pitches?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 10 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our value prop needs to be highly differentiated since these prospects get pitched constantly. We're positioning around three key pillars: liquidity event expertise, tax-efficient wealth transition, and institutional-quality investment access typically reserved for family offices.

The messaging focuses on "wealth transition specialists" rather than generic wealth management - we emphasize our experience with business exits, equity compensation optimization, and complex estate structures. Our differentiator is that we've guided over 500 entrepreneurs and executives through major liquidity events, so we understand the nuances of their specific situations rather than treating them like typical retirees.

For creative execution, we're moving away from stock photos of handshakes toward case study-driven content - "How we helped a SaaS founder minimize taxes on a $50M exit" resonates much better than generic wealth building messages. The sophisticated audience wants proof of expertise with their peer group, not aspirational lifestyle imagery.

AGENT:
Exceptional positioning - "wealth transition specialists" with liquidity event expertise directly addresses your audience's specific pain points and differentiates from generic wealth management.

The case study approach with specific examples like "SaaS founder $50M exit" builds credibility with sophisticated prospects who want evidence of peer-level expertise. This messaging aligns perfectly with your intent signals around business exit planning and tax optimization.

Your value prop creates natural content segmentation opportunities:
- Business exit prospects: Liquidity event case studies
- Executive comp prospects: Equity optimization examples  
- Estate planning prospects: Tax-efficient transition strategies

This messaging sophistication supports your $600 CPL target because it speaks directly to high-value prospects' specific situations rather than broad wealth building themes.

Ready to map this to channel strategy? Given your audience precision, geographic concentration, and sophisticated messaging, we need channels that can deliver both targeting accuracy and creative storytelling capability.
