# Media Plan Output: Precision Targeting with Complex Attributes

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a precision media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Your brief shows sophisticated planning - targeting HNW individuals with $1M+ investable assets in top DMAs with a $1.5M budget for 2,500 qualified leads.

$1.5M ÷ 2,500 = $600 per qualified lead. That's aggressive but achievable for HNW targeting given the asset thresholds and life stage precision you've described.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 2,500 qualified leads? Are you optimizing for AUM conversion, client onboarding velocity, or pipeline value creation?

Turn 2:
Perfect - AUM conversion with quality over volume aligns with your $600 CPL investment. With $2.5M average AUM and wealth management fees, that efficiency becomes highly defensible.

Your primary KPI should be qualified leads that convert to AUM, but I need to understand your conversion funnel. What percentage of qualified leads typically convert to managed assets? And what's your definition of "qualified" - is it asset verification, needs assessment completion, or meeting attendance?

This conversion rate is critical because it determines if your $600 CPL translates to viable client acquisition costs.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it. I'll model using 18% conversion (mid-range of your estimate) with the caveat that improving lead qualification could significantly impact this rate. You can refine as tracking improves.

At 18% conversion: 2,500 qualified leads × 18% = 450 new AUM clients
$1.5M ÷ 450 = $3,333 per AUM client

With $2.5M average AUM per client, that's a 0.13% client acquisition cost relative to assets under management - extremely efficient for wealth management.

However, this assumes your current 18% conversion rate. Given your focus on precision targeting and improved qualification, we should build the plan to potentially drive higher conversion rates.

What's the typical timeline from qualified lead to AUM conversion? This affects how we structure nurturing and attribution windows.

Turn 4:
Excellent context. The 90-day average with longer cycles for higher-value clients is typical for wealth management. This means we need attribution windows that capture the full conversion cycle, and your $3,333 client acquisition cost gets even more attractive when factoring in the extended LTV relationship.

Now let's assess if your $600 CPL target is realistic. Based on wealth management benchmarks, HNW lead generation typically runs $400-$1,200 per qualified lead depending on precision. Your $600 target sits in the achievable range, especially with your 50K client CRM for lookalike modeling.

The key will be tight audience definition and channel efficiency. Given the 6-9 month research cycles for complex cases, we'll need channels that can maintain engagement throughout extended consideration periods.

Your economics look solid: $600 CPL → 18% conversion → $3,333 CAC against $2.5M AUM. Ready to move into audience precision?

Turn 5:
Perfect - your 50K client CRM gives us a significant targeting advantage, and layering intent signals will help capture prospects early in their 6-9 month research cycles.

For precision HNW targeting, we need 15-20 audience signals minimum given your aggressive $600 CPL target. Let's start with your strongest first-party signals.

From your existing 50K clients, what are the 3-4 most predictive characteristics that separate your highest-value AUM clients from lower performers? For example: specific industries, company size, geographic concentration, age ranges, or behavioral patterns in your CRM?

These core signals become our lookalike foundation before we layer in intent data around tax optimization and estate planning research.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Excellent - those are highly predictive signals for wealth management targeting. Tech executives, PE partners, and healthcare practice owners in the 50-62 age range with equity compensation patterns and existing professional advisor relationships.

The SF Bay Area and Seattle outperformance makes perfect sense given liquidity events and equity comp concentration.

For intent layering, you mentioned tax optimization and estate planning research. Are you seeing specific search behaviors or content consumption patterns that indicate someone is approaching a liquidity event or major wealth transition? For example: business valuation research, tax planning content, "selling my company" searches, or retirement planning tools?

These intent signals will help us catch prospects 3-6 months before they actively seek wealth management, giving us first-mover advantage in those extended consideration cycles.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Outstanding intent mapping - those signals perfectly align with your target's wealth transition moments. Business exit planning, sophisticated estate strategies, and executive compensation research are all high-intent indicators for your services.

The Q4 tax optimization surge gives us clear seasonality patterns to leverage, and the "preparing for retirement sale" content performance validates you're capturing prospects at the right moment in their wealth journey.

Now for geographic precision: You mentioned SF Bay Area and Seattle outperform, but you're targeting 10 DMAs total. Should we weight budget allocation toward the higher-performing markets, or do you need presence across all markets for relationship manager coverage?

Also, within each DMA, are there specific zip codes or neighborhoods where your highest-value clients concentrate? HNW targeting often benefits from hyper-local precision rather than broad metro targeting.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Perfect geographic strategy. 40-45% to SF Bay/Seattle captures your highest-performing markets, with hyper-local precision in those wealth concentration zones.

$600K-$675K to SF Peninsula (Palo Alto, Los Altos, Saratoga) and Seattle Eastside (Bellevue, Medina, Mercer Island) with the remaining $825K-$900K distributed across the other 8 DMAs for relationship manager coverage.

Your audience precision is strong: tech executives/PE partners/healthcare practice owners, age 50-62, in wealth-concentrated zip codes, with business exit/estate planning intent signals, layered on 50K client lookalikes.

Now let's confirm your $1.5M budget allocation. Is this purely media spend, or does it include creative production, landing page development, and campaign management? Understanding the true media allocation affects our $600 CPL feasibility.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Excellent - pure media spend gives us full $1.5M for placement, making the $600 CPL much more achievable.

Your concern about volume concentration is valid. HNW audiences in those zip codes are finite, and over-targeting can drive up costs through auction competition and frequency saturation.

Based on your targeting precision and geographic concentration, I estimate your total addressable audience across all DMAs at roughly 75K-100K individuals. To generate 2,500 qualified leads, you need approximately 3% response rate from your addressable audience - aggressive but feasible with your intent layering and lookalike modeling.

The key will be channel diversification to avoid over-saturating any single platform's HNW inventory. We'll likely need a mix that includes LinkedIn for professional targeting, programmatic for geographic precision, search for intent capture, and possibly direct mail for the ultra-targeted zip codes.

What's your value proposition messaging strategy for these sophisticated prospects who likely receive multiple wealth management pitches?

Turn 10:
Exceptional positioning - "wealth transition specialists" with liquidity event expertise directly addresses your audience's specific pain points and differentiates from generic wealth management.

The case study approach with specific examples like "SaaS founder $50M exit" builds credibility with sophisticated prospects who want evidence of peer-level expertise. This messaging aligns perfectly with your intent signals around business exit planning and tax optimization.

Your value prop creates natural content segmentation opportunities:
- Business exit prospects: Liquidity event case studies
- Executive comp prospects: Equity optimization examples  
- Estate planning prospects: Tax-efficient transition strategies

This messaging sophistication supports your $600 CPL target because it speaks directly to high-value prospects' specific situations rather than broad wealth building themes.

Ready to map this to channel strategy? Given your audience precision, geographic concentration, and sophisticated messaging, we need channels that can deliver both targeting accuracy and creative storytelling capability.
