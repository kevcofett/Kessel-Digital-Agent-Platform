# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience Unified Media Plan

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build this multi-segment media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've given me excellent segment detail upfront - that's going to make our targeting much sharper. Let me start with the foundation.

**Quick Math Check:**
$3M budget ÷ 25,000 enrollees = $120 per acquisition across all segments

That's aggressive but achievable for health insurance if we nail the targeting and channel mix.

**First Question:** What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 25,000 new enrollees? Are you focused on premium revenue growth, market share expansion in specific regions, or something else? This shapes how we weight the segments and measure success.

Turn 2:
Perfect - premium revenue growth with segment-specific LTV considerations. That suburban family insight is key since higher LTV justifies higher acquisition costs.

**Your Primary KPI:** Given premium revenue focus, I recommend **Annual Premium Value (APV)** as your north star metric rather than just enrollment count. This weights high-value family enrollments appropriately.

**Quick Modeling:**
If families average $8,000 APV, young professionals $4,000 APV, and pre-Medicare $6,000 APV, your 25,000 enrollees could generate $125M+ in annual premiums depending on segment mix.

**Volume Target Question:** Do you have a preferred split across the three segments, or should we optimize purely for revenue? For example, if families drive 2x the LTV of young professionals, should we weight acquisition toward families even if their CAC is higher?

This affects how we allocate that $3M budget across segments.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent allocation thinking. Let me model this out:

**Budget Allocation:**
- Families: $1.35M (45%) 
- Young Professionals: $1.05M (35%)
- Pre-Medicare: $600K (20%)

**Implied Efficiency by Segment:**
At your suggested split and assuming revenue-weighted enrollment distribution:
- Families: ~$135 CAC (premium target, justified by $8K APV)
- Young Professionals: ~$105 CAC (volume play at $4K APV) 
- Pre-Medicare: ~$120 CAC (middle efficiency at $6K APV)

**Reality Check:** These CACs are ambitious but achievable for health insurance with tight targeting. Families at $135 CAC gives you a 59:1 LTV ratio in year one alone - very healthy.

**Key Question:** Do you have existing customer data we can use for lookalike targeting? First-party data typically improves efficiency by 40-60% versus cold prospecting. With your aggressive targets, lookalikes from high-value current customers could be the difference between hitting these numbers and missing them.

Turn 4:
Perfect - 150K members gives us excellent lookalike foundation. Rich family data is crucial since that's your highest-budget segment.

**Economics Assessment:** Your implied CACs look realistic with strong first-party data:
- Families: $135 CAC with lookalikes should hit efficiently 
- Young Professionals: $105 CAC achievable with digital-native targeting
- Pre-Medicare: $120 CAC reasonable given their research-heavy journey

The math works. $3M budget targeting 25,000 enrollees at $120 blended CAC is aggressive but your lookalike advantage and LTV ratios support it.

**Moving to Audience Definition:** You've outlined broad segments, but let's get precise for targeting. Starting with your highest-budget segment - **Families** - beyond ages 35-50 with kids under 18 in suburban markets, what other signals define your best family customers? 

For example: household income ranges, homeownership, employer size, current insurance status (individual vs group), or specific life events that trigger shopping?

The tighter we define this audience, the better our $1.35M performs.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Perfect - that paints a clear picture of your young professional segment.

**Young Professional Audience Signals:**
- Ages 26-35, urban metros (NYC, SF, LA, Chicago)
- HHI $50K-$90K, gym members, health-conscious
- Startup/tech employees with inadequate coverage, gig workers, freelancers, creators
- Value wellness benefits, broad networks, sports medicine access
- Triggers: aging off parents' plans, job changes, metro area moves
- Digital-first interactions

**Quick Check:** The $50K-$90K range in expensive metros like SF/NYC is tight - these folks are cost-sensitive. Your $4K APV suggests you're offering competitive pricing for this segment, which is smart.

**Final Segment:** For **Pre-Medicare** with $600K budget, you mentioned ages 55-64, national but heavy in FL, AZ, TX, focused on stability and network quality. What income characteristics and employment status define your best pre-Medicare customers? Are they mostly still working, early retirees, or a mix? And what specific concerns drive their insurance shopping at this life stage?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Excellent targeting precision. That's 8-10 strong signals for the family segment:

**Family Audience Signals:**
- Ages 35-50, kids under 18, suburban top 50 metros
- HHI $75K-$150K, homeowners
- Mid-size company employees, self-employed, small business owners
- Life event triggers: new baby, job change, spouse employment shift
- Above ACA subsidy threshold
- Currently on individual plans or COBRA

This level of specificity should drive your $135 CAC down significantly with lookalikes.

**Quick Validation:** Are you seeing seasonal patterns around these life events? January (job changes), spring (new babies), and fall (open enrollment anxiety) could affect pacing strategy.

**Next Segment:** For **Young Professionals** with $1.05M budget, beyond ages 26-35 in urban metros who are health-conscious gym members preferring digital interactions - what income range and employment patterns define your best young professional customers? Are they predominantly employed or do you see gig economy workers, and what triggers their insurance shopping?

Turn 8:
Smart geographic strategy - proven markets for stability, growth markets for expansion.

**Family Geographic Allocation:**
- Proven markets (70% = $945K): Suburban Dallas, Atlanta, Phoenix
- Growth markets (30% = $405K): Suburban Seattle, Denver, Nashville, Austin, Raleigh-Durham

That $405K test budget across 5 growth markets gives you ~$81K per market - enough for meaningful testing without overcommitting.

**Young Professional Geography:** For the $1.05M targeting urban cores, are you planning to concentrate in your strongest metro markets, or does the digital-native behavior of this segment let you cast wider? Urban young professionals often have similar media consumption patterns regardless of city, which could favor broader geographic targeting with digital channels.

**Quick Consideration:** Your proven suburban family markets (Dallas, Atlanta, Phoenix) also have strong urban cores for young professionals. Any advantage to geographic overlap for operational efficiency, or do the audience behaviors differ enough that it doesn't matter?

Turn 9:
Perfect geographic strategy for young professionals.

**Young Professional Geographic Allocation:**
- Proven metros (60% = $630K): Dallas, Atlanta, Phoenix, LA, NYC, Chicago urban cores
- Test metros (40% = $420K): Seattle, Denver, Austin, San Francisco

That gives you $105K per proven metro and $105K per test metro - solid testing budget with digital efficiency.

**Pre-Medicare Geography:** For your $600K pre-Medicare budget, you mentioned heavy concentration in FL, AZ, TX. Given their risk-averse nature and focus on network stability, should we concentrate almost entirely in your established markets? Or does the retirement relocation pattern create opportunities in other Sun Belt markets like NC, SC, NV where retirees are moving but competition might be lighter?

**Strategic Note:** Your operational infrastructure in Phoenix and Dallas suburban markets (families) plus urban cores (young professionals) creates nice synergies. Adding pre-Medicare in those same metros could maximize your local market presence and operational efficiency.

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Excellent - that completes our audience definition across all three segments.

**Pre-Medicare Audience Signals:**
- Ages 55-64, heavy concentration FL/AZ/TX
- HHI $60K-$100K (wide range $40K-$120K+)
- Small company employees, early retirees, bridge-to-Medicare, consultants
- Prioritize network stability, prescription coverage, Medicare transition planning
- Often relocating for retirement, losing employer coverage in moves
- Risk-averse, value continuity over innovation

**Economics Validation Complete:** All three segments show realistic CAC targets with your lookalike data advantage:
- Families: $135 CAC, strong LTV at $8K APV
- Young Professionals: $105 CAC, volume play at $4K APV  
- Pre-Medicare: $120 CAC, solid immediate value at $6K APV

**Moving to Geography:** You've outlined broad markets, but let's get specific for budget allocation. For the $1.35M family budget, should we weight toward specific suburban markets within those top 50 metros based on your current penetration, or are there untapped suburban markets where competition might be lighter?

Turn 10:
Excellent - that completes our geographic strategy across all segments.

**Pre-Medicare Geographic Allocation:**
- Established markets (80% = $480K): FL, AZ, TX focus areas
- Test markets (20% = $120K): Charlotte, Vegas, South Carolina markets

**Complete Budget & Geography Summary:**
- **Families ($1.35M):** 70% proven suburban (Dallas/Atlanta/Phoenix), 30% growth markets
- **Young Professionals ($1.05M):** 60% proven metros, 40% test metros  
- **Pre-Medicare ($600K):** 80% established Sun Belt, 20% retirement relocation markets

**Strategic Validation:** Your $3M budget efficiently targets 25,000 enrollees at $120 blended CAC. The geographic synergies in Dallas and Phoenix create operational leverage across all three segments.

**Moving to Value Proposition:** Each segment needs distinct messaging. For **Families** - your highest LTV segment - what's the primary value proposition that resonates? Is it comprehensive coverage for the whole family, cost predictability, provider choice, or something else that drives their enrollment decisions?

Turn 11:
Perfect - "complete family coverage without surprises" captures their core need brilliantly.

**Family Value Proposition:**
- Primary: Comprehensive protection + cost predictability
- Key messages: No surprise bills, clear out-of-pocket maximums, broad pediatric/specialist networks
- Emotional driver: Peace of mind for family's health AND financial stability
- Not competing on price - competing on value and protection

**Young Professional Value Proposition:** This segment values convenience and digital experience. What's the primary value proposition that resonates with them? Is it flexibility for their mobile lifestyle, wellness benefits that align with their health-conscious behavior, easy digital management, or competitive pricing for their tighter budgets?

**Context:** Your $4K APV suggests you're balancing affordability with benefits - how do you position that value for someone making $50K-$90K in expensive metros?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 12:
Excellent positioning - "health coverage that fits your lifestyle" perfectly captures their values-driven decision making.

**Young Professional Value Proposition:**
- Primary: Lifestyle alignment + digital convenience
- Key messages: Network flexibility, mobile-first experience, wellness benefits inclusion
- Emotional driver: Health partner that supports their priorities, not just coverage
- Value perception: Worth paying more for alignment with health-conscious lifestyle

**Pre-Medicare Value Proposition:** This segment prioritizes stability and Medicare transition planning. What's the primary message that drives their enrollment? Is it network continuity, prescription coverage reliability, seamless Medicare transition, or something else that addresses their specific concerns at this life stage?

**Context:** At $6K APV, you're likely positioning as premium stability rather than budget option - how do you justify that value to someone bridging to Medicare?
