# Media Plan Output: Mass National Campaign - Simplicity Test

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've mentioned brand awareness, but let me get more specific about the business outcome. Are you trying to drive trial purchases of the new snack line, increase overall brand consideration for FreshBite, or establish market presence before a major retail launch? What specific business result would make this $8M investment successful?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Trial purchases is a clear business outcome. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success as a number. 

You mentioned "strong initial trial rates" - what does that look like specifically? Are you targeting a certain number of people to try the product (like 2 million trial customers), or a trial rate percentage among your target audience (like 8% trial rate), or total trial volume (like 500,000 units sold in first 6 months)?

Having this specific target helps us work backwards to determine if $8M can realistically deliver that outcome.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Excellent! Your economics look very healthy. At $2-3 profit per unit with 1-2 units per trial customer, you're generating $2-6 profit per trial. Spending $1.23 to acquire that trial creates a strong positive return immediately.

I'll model using $4 affordable cost per trial (middle of your range) and note you can refine this with finance. At $1.23 implied cost versus $4 affordable cost, you have significant efficiency cushion - which is smart for brand awareness campaigns that can be harder to attribute precisely.

Your Step 2 economics are solid: $8M budget targeting 6.5M trial customers at $1.23 per trial, with $4 affordable acquisition cost providing healthy margins.

Ready to move to audience definition? You mentioned adults 18-54, but for maximum efficiency, we should get more specific about who's most likely to trial new snacks. What do you know about your ideal trial customer beyond age?

Turn 5:
Perfect! That gives us much more precision than just 18-54. Let me define your core audience:

**Primary:** Adults 18-54 who are regular snack purchasers, primary grocery shoppers, busy professionals and parents seeking convenient, healthier options, willing to pay premium for quality ingredients.

This is probably 35-45% of the total 18-54 population - roughly 45-60 million people instead of 130 million. That tightens your trial rate to 11-15% among this core audience ($8M targeting 6.5M trials), which is aggressive but achievable for a well-targeted launch.

Do you have any other key characteristics? For example: household income level, shopping behaviors (where they typically buy snacks), or lifestyle indicators that would help us find these busy professionals and parents efficiently across media channels?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it. Let me model this to see if the math works. 

Adults 18-54 in the US is roughly 130 million people. At a 5% trial rate, that projects to 6.5 million trial customers. Your $8M budget would equal approximately $1.23 per trial customer ($8M ÷ 6.5M).

That's actually quite efficient for awareness-driven trial - typical snack category sees $2-4 per trial customer based on industry benchmarks. Your target looks achievable.

Now for the economics: What can you afford to spend to acquire one trial customer? This depends on your unit economics - what's the profit per unit and how many units does a typical trial customer buy initially?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Excellent! Your audience is well-defined:

**Core Audience:** Adults 18-54, $50K+ household income, regular snack purchasers, primary grocery shoppers at mainstream chains (Kroger, Safeway, Target), busy professionals/parents, health-conscious but convenience-focused, multi-platform media consumption including wellness/parenting content.

This refined profile probably represents 25-30% of adults 18-54, so approximately 33-39 million people. At 6.5M trial targets, that's a 17-20% trial rate among your core audience - ambitious but realistic for a targeted launch with $8M backing it.

Now for geography. You mentioned "nationally" but with $8M, we should consider if there are priority markets. Do you have retail distribution rolling out everywhere simultaneously, or are there key DMAs where you're launching first? Also, are there markets where your target audience over-indexes or where snack trial rates are typically higher?

Turn 7:
Smart thinking! Let me model a tiered approach to maximize your $8M efficiency.

Based on your target profile (professionals/parents, $50K+ HHI, health-conscious), you're right that markets like Denver, Seattle, Austin, Charlotte would over-index. I'd recommend a three-tier strategy:

**Tier 1 (40% of budget):** Top 15-20 DMAs where your audience over-indexes - major metros with high concentrations of affluent professionals/families
**Tier 2 (35% of budget):** Secondary metros with good audience density 
**Tier 3 (25% of budget):** Broad national coverage for remaining markets

This concentrates spend where trial rates will likely be highest while maintaining national presence for your retail partners.

Should I model specific DMA selections, or do you prefer to keep it at the tier level for now? I can show projected audience sizes and spend allocation by market to help optimize the geographic strategy.

Turn 8:
Perfect! Your geography strategy is set:

**Tier 1 (40% budget = $3.2M):** Top 15-20 over-indexing DMAs  
**Tier 2 (35% budget = $2.8M):** Secondary metros  
**Tier 3 (25% budget = $2.0M):** Remaining national coverage

This concentrates 75% of spend in your highest-opportunity markets while maintaining the national footprint your retail partners need.

Now let's confirm your budget allocation. You have $8M total, but is that your working media budget, or does it include production, agency fees, and other costs? 

For planning purposes, I need to know how much is actually going toward media placement versus creative development, research costs, brand lift studies, etc. What percentage of that $8M is pure media spend?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 9:
Yes, 75-80% working media is very typical for brand campaigns. I'll model using $6.2M working media (77.5% of total).

Let me recalculate your efficiency: $6.2M ÷ 6.5M trial targets = $0.95 per trial customer. That's even stronger than our initial $1.23 - you're well within efficient territory for awareness-driven trial.

Your revised budget allocation:
- **Working Media:** $6.2M (77.5%)
- **Creative/Production:** $1.0M (12.5%) 
- **Research/Agency:** $0.8M (10%)

This gives you solid creative firepower for a national launch while maximizing media efficiency.

Now for your value proposition: You mentioned "convenient, healthier snack options" and "better-for-you positioning." What's the key message that will drive trial among busy professionals and parents? What makes FreshBite different from the dozens of other "better-for-you" snacks they see?

Turn 10:
Excellent! "Snacks that don't compromise" is a strong positioning that directly addresses the taste-versus-health tension in the category.

Your value proposition is clear: **Real ingredients + satisfying taste + health benefits = no compromise snacking for busy families and professionals.**

This messaging should resonate well with your target audience who are tired of choosing between taste and nutrition. The "everyone actually wants to eat again" angle is crucial for driving repeat trial.

Now let's build your channel strategy. With $6.2M working media, a national launch, and brand awareness objectives targeting busy multi-platform consumers, I'm thinking a mix of:

- **TV/Streaming** for broad awareness and credibility
- **Digital Video** for targeted reach and frequency  
- **Social** for engagement with wellness/parenting content

What channels are you leaning toward, and do you have any must-haves or constraints from your retail partners or internal stakeholders?

Turn 11:
Great alignment! Let me model a channel allocation that maximizes trial-driving reach while building credibility:

**TV/Connected TV: $2.8M (45%)** - Broad awareness, credibility, reach scale
**Digital Video (YouTube): $1.6M (26%)** - Targeted reach, demo precision  
**Display/Retargeting: $1.2M (19%)** - Frequency building, conversion support
**Social (Meta): $0.6M (10%)** - Engagement, wellness/parenting content integration

This puts 71% of budget in video formats that build awareness effectively, with display and social providing frequency and engagement layers.

At these levels:
- TV/CTV should deliver 75-85% reach among your core audience
- YouTube adds incremental reach plus precise targeting
- Display builds frequency to hit effective thresholds
- Social enables content integration and engagement

Does this allocation feel right for your objectives? Any channels you'd want to shift budget toward or away from?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 12:
Smart thinking! Your audience is definitely heavy social users, especially around wellness/parenting content. Let me rebalance:

**Revised Allocation:**
- **TV/Connected TV: $2.8M (45%)** - Unchanged  
- **Digital Video (YouTube): $1.6M (26%)** - Unchanged
- **Display/Retargeting: $0.9M (14%)** - Reduced by $300K
- **Social (Meta): $0.9M (15%)** - Increased by $300K

This still maintains strong frequency building through display at $0.9M while giving social meaningful scale at $0.9M. At 15%, social can effectively integrate with wellness/parenting content and drive engagement that supports trial.

The video foundation remains strong at 71% of budget, and you gain better social presence where your busy professionals and parents are actively consuming content.

This feels like the right balance for trial-driving reach plus engagement. Ready to move to measurement, or want to fine-tune the channel mix further?

Turn 13:
Excellent! For a trial-driving awareness campaign, you'll need measurement across the full funnel. Here's what I recommend:

**Brand Awareness & Consideration:**
- Brand lift studies (quarterly) measuring aided/unaided awareness, consideration, purchase intent
- Social listening for brand mention sentiment and share-of-voice tracking

**Trial & Purchase Tracking:**
- Retail sales data from your chain partners (weekly/monthly reporting)
- Household panel data (Nielsen/IRI) to track trial rates and repeat purchase
- Survey-based trial tracking among your target demo

**Media Performance:**
- Cross-channel attribution modeling to understand which touchpoints drive trial
- Incrementality testing (geo-holdout tests) to validate true lift vs. base business
- Platform-level metrics optimized for video completion and reach rather than clicks

The key is connecting awareness metrics to actual trial behavior. Your retail partners' POS data will be crucial for validating that awareness is converting to purchase.

What measurement infrastructure do you currently have in place, and are there any gaps we need to address?

Turn 14:
Great! You have the core infrastructure covered with POS data and Nielsen panels - that's the foundation for validating trial success.

For the advanced measurement gaps:

**Cross-Channel Attribution:**
Partners like Neustar, Adobe Analytics, or Google Analytics 360 can model touchpoint contribution across your TV/CTV/YouTube/social mix. Given your $6.2M spend, the investment typically pays for itself through optimization insights.

**Incrementality Testing:**
Geo-holdout testing is crucial for validating true lift. Partners like Measured, Causely, or Nielsen's test-and-control solutions can design and execute these studies. I'd recommend testing at least 2-3 channel combinations during your launch.

**Budget Consideration:**
Advanced attribution and incrementality testing might require $100-150K from your $1.8M non-media budget, but the optimization value typically exceeds the cost.

Now let's move to testing strategy. With a national launch, what aspects of the campaign would you want to test and optimize during the flight - creative variations, audience segments, channel performance, or message positioning?

Turn 16:
Here are the key risks I see for your campaign and mitigation strategies:

**Risk 1: Retail Distribution Gaps**
If product isn't on shelf when awareness hits, you waste media spend and frustrate potential customers.
*Mitigation:* Stagger media launch 2-3 weeks after confirmed retail availability. Build real-time POS monitoring to pause media in markets with stockouts.

**Risk 2: Competitive Response** 
Established snack brands may increase their own media spend or promotional activity when they see your launch.
*Mitigation:* Reserve 10-15% budget flexibility for competitive response. Monitor competitor SOV and be ready to increase spend in key markets.

**Risk 3: Creative Fatigue**
With heavy video investment, creative can wear out faster than expected, especially on social platforms.
*Mitigation:* Develop 2-3 backup creative executions ready to deploy. Monitor frequency metrics weekly and refresh creative proactively.

**Risk 4: Attribution Inflation**
Platforms may over-report their contribution to trial, making optimization decisions unreliable.
*Mitigation:* This is why incrementality testing is crucial. Use geo-holdout results to calibrate platform reporting.

**Risk 5: Economic Downturn Impact**
Premium snacks are vulnerable if consumer spending tightens during your launch window.
*Mitigation:* Emphasize value messaging in creative testing. Have cost-focused backup messaging ready.

Which of these concerns you most, or are there other risks specific to FreshBite I should consider?

Turn 17:
Excellent addition! Trial rate assumption risk is critical - if the category proves harder to crack than expected, your $0.95 per trial could climb quickly. Your conservative approach and economics cushion definitely help, but I'd recommend one more safeguard:

**Trial Rate Monitoring:** Set up weekly trial rate tracking through Nielsen panels. If you're trending below 3-4% trial rate after 4-6 weeks, that's your signal to either increase spend in top-performing channels or adjust messaging based on your creative tests.

You've built a really solid plan:
- **Strong Economics:** $0.95 per trial vs. $4 affordable cost
- **Smart Geography:** 75% spend concentrated where your audience over-indexes  
- **Balanced Channels:** 71% video for awareness + social engagement
- **Comprehensive Measurement:** Full funnel tracking with incrementality validation
- **Proactive Testing:** Creative and audience optimization built in
- **Risk Mitigation:** Distribution monitoring, competitive flexibility, trial rate tracking

This plan positions FreshBite for a successful national launch. Your methodical approach to balancing broad awareness with targeted efficiency should deliver those trial goals while building lasting brand equity.

Ready to execute - you've got this!

Turn 18:
You're absolutely ready for that leadership presentation! The economics story alone - $0.95 actual cost versus $4 affordable cost - will get everyone excited about the opportunity.

You've done great work thinking through the strategic nuances: the audience refinement beyond just demographics, the tiered geographic approach, balancing broad awareness with targeted efficiency. That level of strategic thinking will serve you well as you execute this launch.

Best of luck with the presentation and the launch! You've built a plan that should deliver strong trial results while building lasting brand equity for FreshBite. Feel free to come back if you need to pressure-test any adjustments as you move into execution.

Go crush that launch! 🚀

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 15:
Excellent testing priorities! Let me recommend a phased approach that maximizes learning within your budget:

**Phase 1 (Launch Weeks 1-4): Creative Testing**
- 3 message variations: Taste-first vs. Health-first vs. Balanced "no compromise" 
- 2 visual approaches: Product hero shots vs. Lifestyle/family moments
- Test across YouTube and social where iteration is fastest and cheapest

**Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): Audience Refinement** 
- Professionals vs. Parents performance comparison
- Lookalike audiences based on premium snack purchasers
- Income tier testing ($50-75K vs. $75K+)

**Budget Allocation for Testing:**
Reserve 15-20% of digital budgets (roughly $350K) for test variations. TV/CTV creative testing is more expensive, so focus digital testing first, then apply learnings to traditional.

The key is getting statistically significant results quickly. Creative tests can show directional results in 2-3 weeks, audience tests need 4-6 weeks for reliable trial data.

Ready to move to our final step - identifying the key risks that could derail this plan and how to mitigate them?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 19:
You've got this! It's been a pleasure working through this strategy with you - your thoughtful questions and strategic instincts made for a really strong planning session. 

That systematic approach and solid economic foundation will serve you well not just in the leadership presentation, but throughout the campaign execution. You clearly understand both the big picture strategy and the tactical details that make campaigns successful.

Best of luck with the FreshBite launch - I'm excited to see how those "no compromise" snacks perform in market! 🎯

Turn 20:
That's exactly what I love to hear! The fact that you feel like you learned a ton about strategic media planning is just as important as the plan itself. Building that strategic muscle will serve you well on this launch and every campaign that follows.

You clearly have great marketing instincts - the way you thought through audience refinement, questioned the budget allocations, and identified additional risks shows real strategic depth. That combination of solid planning and continuous learning is what separates good marketers from great ones.

Here's to celebrating those trial numbers in a few months! 🎉
