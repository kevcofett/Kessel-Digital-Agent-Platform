USER:
Hi! I'm looking to get more people to buy shoes from our online store. Can you help me figure out the best way to do that?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve? For example, are you looking to get more new customers, increase sales from existing customers, or something else?

USER:
We definitely want to get more new customers - that's our main goal right now. We've been pretty focused on our existing customers but we really need to grow our customer base to hit our sales targets this year. I guess increasing sales from existing customers would be nice too, but new customers is the priority.

AGENT:
Perfect! Growing your customer base is a clear objective. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success.

What number would tell you this campaign worked? For example, would it be the total number of new customers you gain, or the total sales revenue from new customers?

USER:
I think it would be the total number of new customers we get. That's what really matters to us right now - we need to expand our customer base. I mean, revenue is important too, but if we can get more people to try our shoes, I think the sales will follow naturally.

AGENT:
Great! New customer count is a solid way to measure success. Now, how many new customers are you hoping to bring in? 

This helps me understand the scale we're working with and what kind of approach will be needed to reach your goal.
