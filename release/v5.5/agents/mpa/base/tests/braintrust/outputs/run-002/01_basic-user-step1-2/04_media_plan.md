# Media Plan Output: Basic User - Steps 1-2 Completion

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve? For example, are you looking to get more new customers, increase sales from existing customers, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Growing your customer base is a clear objective. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success.

What number would tell you this campaign worked? For example, would it be the total number of new customers you gain, or the total sales revenue from new customers?

Turn 3:
Great! New customer count is a solid way to measure success. Now, how many new customers are you hoping to bring in? 

This helps me understand the scale we're working with and what kind of approach will be needed to reach your goal.
