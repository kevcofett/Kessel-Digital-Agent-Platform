# Media Plan Output: Sophisticated User - IDK Protocol

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect - you've given me a strong foundation. You want 10,000 new users with $500K spend. That calculates to $50 per user acquisition, which is tight but achievable for fintech.

What's the primary business outcome you're driving toward? Are you focused on user volume, transaction volume, or revenue growth from these 10,000 users?

Turn 3:
Perfect. I'll model using fintech remittance benchmarks and you can refine anytime.

Based on industry data, active remittance users typically generate 2-3x their first 90-day volume over 12 months. Using your $500 first 90 days:
- 12-month volume: ~$1,200 per user
- At 2.5% take rate: ~$30 revenue per user
- Your $50 CAC implies 1.7x LTV/CAC ratio

That's lean but workable for acquisition-focused campaigns. High-performing remittance companies typically target 2.5-3x ratios, but many start tighter while optimizing retention.

The key insight: at $50 CAC, we need very efficient channels and precise audience targeting. Your 30% quality focus becomes critical - inactive users who don't hit that $500 threshold will hurt unit economics significantly.

This efficiency is achievable but requires disciplined execution. Ready to define your target audience to hit these numbers?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Got it - 10,000 quality users who actually transact is your primary objective. That's smart positioning between pure volume and long-term value.

Now let's validate if your $50 per user target is realistic. $500K ÷ 10K = $50 per acquisition. 

For remittance, I'm modeling typical take rates at 2-3% of transaction volume. If your average user sends $500 in their first 90 days, that's $10-15 in revenue per user. To break even at $50 acquisition cost, users would need to generate roughly $500-750 in transaction volume over their lifetime.

Does that transaction volume assumption align with your user behavior data? And what's your actual take rate if you can share it?
