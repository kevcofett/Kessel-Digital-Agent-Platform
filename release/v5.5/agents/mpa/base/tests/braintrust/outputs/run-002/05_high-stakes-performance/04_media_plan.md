# Media Plan Output: High-Stakes Performance Campaign

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by calculating your implied efficiency: $2M ÷ 50,000 = $40 per merchant acquisition. With $850 LTV, that's a strong 21x LTV/CAC ratio - very healthy for fintech.

Your business outcome is clear: acquire 50,000 new merchants. How do you define success beyond merchant count? Are you tracking metrics like time to first transaction, merchant transaction volume, or revenue per merchant in the first 90 days?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your primary KPI is 50,000 new merchants, with quality gates of first transaction within 7 days and $15K monthly volume in first 90 days. That's smart - acquisition without activation kills unit economics.

Your $40 CAC target looks achievable for fintech. Based on industry benchmarks, payment platforms typically see $35-60 CAC for quality merchants, so you're well within range.

One key question on your economics: Does your $850 LTV assume all acquired merchants, or only those who hit your $15K monthly volume threshold? This affects whether we need to factor in activation rates when modeling realistic acquisition volumes.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Brilliant - you're thinking like a performance marketer. Channel-level activation rates completely change the math:

LinkedIn: 75% activation = $53 effective CAC per valuable merchant
Google Ads: 57.5% activation = $70 effective CAC per valuable merchant  
Programmatic: Likely 45-50% initially = $80-89 effective CAC

This suggests LinkedIn should get premium budget allocation despite potentially higher nominal CACs, since your blended efficiency improves.

Quick modeling question: When you factor in these activation differences, are you comfortable with the overall plan requiring ~83,333 total merchant acquisitions to hit 50,000 quality merchants? That's assuming a 60% blended activation rate across all channels.

Or should we target a higher-quality channel mix to reduce total volume needed and improve economics?

Turn 5:
Smart thinking. Let's model the improved scenario:

At 67.5% blended activation rate: 50,000 ÷ 0.675 = 74,074 total acquisitions needed
Effective CAC: $2M ÷ 50,000 = $40 per valuable merchant (much cleaner)
LTV/CAC: $850 ÷ $40 = 21.25x (back to your original healthy ratio)

This confirms Step 2 - your economics are absolutely viable with strategic channel weighting.

Now for Step 3: Let's define your target merchants. You mentioned LinkedIn reaches "more established businesses" with better activation. Can you describe your ideal merchant profile? What business characteristics - size, industry, transaction patterns, business maturity - correlate with that 75% activation rate and $15K+ monthly volume?

Turn 6:
Excellent profile. You've identified businesses with strategic payment needs, not just cost shoppers. That's why LinkedIn works - you're reaching decision-makers who understand value beyond price.

Key audience signals emerging:
- Service-based: consulting, agencies, SaaS, professional services  
- 2-3+ years operating history (business maturity)
- $10K-100K monthly processing (established revenue)
- Pain points: high fees, poor integration, weak reporting
- E-commerce $50K+ monthly (secondary segment)
- Strategic mindset vs. transactional buyers

One critical question: When you say "decision-makers," who specifically signs off on payment platform changes? Is it the business owner, CFO, operations manager, or does this vary by business size? Understanding the decision-maker helps us target the right person within these established businesses.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent insight. This changes the economics significantly:

$2M ÷ 50,000 = $40 per acquired merchant
But only 60% activate, so: 50,000 × 0.6 = 30,000 valuable merchants
Real cost per valuable merchant: $2M ÷ 30,000 = $67 CAC

Your LTV/CAC ratio is actually 12.7x ($850 ÷ $67), still very healthy but more realistic than the initial 21x.

This means we need to acquire ~83,333 total merchants to get your 50,000 target of quality merchants. That's a critical distinction for audience sizing and channel planning.

Are you confident in that 60% activation rate, or does it vary by acquisition source? Some channels might deliver merchants more likely to activate than others.

Turn 7:
Perfect. That gives us clear targeting structure:

**Small businesses (<$50K monthly):** Owner/founder direct decision
**Mid-size businesses ($50K-100K):** Operations manager evaluation + C-level approval

This impacts our messaging and channel strategy significantly - we need content that speaks to both operational pain points and strategic business value.

Before we move to geography, one more audience question: Do you see meaningful performance differences across industries within your sweet spot? For instance, do SaaS companies activate differently than marketing agencies, or consulting firms differently than e-commerce? Or is the business size and maturity more predictive than specific industry vertical?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 8:
Excellent data. SaaS stands out with 80% activation plus higher volumes - that's premium inventory for your media plan.

Refined audience priority:
1. **SaaS companies** (80% activation, high volume)
2. **Professional services** (consulting, agencies - solid but variable)  
3. **E-commerce $50K+** (good activation, higher churn risk)

All filtered for 2-3+ years operating and $10K+ monthly processing.

Step 4: Geography. Are you targeting nationally, or do you see geographic patterns in your best merchants? For example, do SaaS companies concentrate in tech hubs, or professional services cluster in major metros? Understanding geographic distribution helps us allocate your $2M budget efficiently across markets.

Turn 9:
Smart expansion strategy. Secondary markets offer CAC arbitrage while major metros provide volume and SaaS density.

Let me structure this geographically. I'll need to map your metros to DMAs for media planning:

**Tier 1 - Major Tech/Business Hubs (70% budget):**
- San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose (SaaS heavy)
- New York (financial services, agencies) 
- Boston (SaaS, professional services)
- Seattle-Tacoma (SaaS, tech services)
- Los Angeles (agencies, e-commerce)
- Chicago (professional services, SaaS)

**Tier 2 - Expansion Markets (30% budget):**
- Denver, Nashville, Phoenix, plus others

Quick question: Within your Tier 1 markets, do you want to weight toward SaaS-heavy metros like SF and Boston given their 80% activation rates? Or maintain even distribution across all major metros?

Turn 10:
Perfect allocation logic. Let me structure this:

**GEOGRAPHY ALLOCATION TABLE**

| DMA Market | Budget % | Budget $ | Rationale |
|------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| **TIER 1 MARKETS (70% - $1,400K)** |
| San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose | 25% | $500K | Highest SaaS density, 80% activation |
| Boston | 15% | $300K | Strong SaaS market, premium activation |
| Seattle-Tacoma | 12% | $240K | Tech services concentration |
| New York | 15% | $300K | Volume play, diverse verticals |
| Chicago | 5% | $100K | Professional services base |
| Los Angeles | 5% | $100K | Agencies, e-commerce mix |
| **TIER 2 EXPANSION (30% - $600K)** |
| Denver, Nashville, Phoenix+ | 30% | $600K | CAC arbitrage testing |

**TOTAL** | **100%** | **$2,000K** |

This gives you $500K concentrated firepower in SF for maximum SaaS penetration, while maintaining volume plays in NYC and testing expansion markets.

Ready for Step 5: Budget allocation by audience segment within these markets?

Turn 13:
Perfect - you've nailed segment-specific value props that align with actual business pain:

**SaaS Value Prop:** "Seamless recurring revenue management" 
- Core pain: Billing complexity, failed payments, dunning
- Outcome: Focus on growth, not payment operations

**Professional Services Value Prop:** "Faster payments, better client relationships"
- Core pain: Late payments, manual invoicing, cash flow gaps  
- Outcome: Get paid faster, professional client experience

**Reporting differentiation:** MRR/churn analytics for SaaS vs. cash flow forecasting for professional services.

This gives us clear creative direction for Step 7. Speaking of channels - you mentioned LinkedIn performs well with 75% activation, Google Ads at 57.5%, and interest in programmatic B2B testing. 

Ready to build your channel strategy? We'll allocate that $2M across channels based on your segment priorities and activation rate data.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 11:
Good call on Austin - it's becoming a major SaaS hub. Let's adjust:

**REVISED ALLOCATION:**
- Austin: 3% ($60K) - growing SaaS market
- Chicago: 4% ($80K) 
- Los Angeles: 4% ($80K)

Now for Step 5 - audience segment allocation. Given your activation rates and LTV data:

**SEGMENT WEIGHTING RECOMMENDATION:**
- **SaaS Companies: 50% ($1M)** - 80% activation, highest volumes
- **Professional Services: 35% ($700K)** - solid performers, broad market
- **E-commerce $50K+: 15% ($300K)** - good activation but higher churn

This heavily weights your best-performing segment while maintaining diversification. The math works:
- SaaS: $1M ÷ 80% activation = effective reach for premium merchants
- Prof Services: $700K for your reliable base
- E-commerce: $300K for volume/testing

Does this segment weighting align with your growth priorities, or would you adjust the SaaS/Professional Services split?

Turn 12:
Excellent refinement. You're optimizing for predictable revenue:

**FINAL SEGMENT ALLOCATION:**
- **SaaS Companies: 55% ($1.1M)** - Your most predictable performers
- **Professional Services: 30% ($600K)** - Reliable base business  
- **E-commerce $50K+: 15% ($300K)** - Learning investment with upside

This gives you $1.1M concentrated on your highest-certainty segment while maintaining enough professional services volume and e-commerce learning budget.

Step 6: Value Proposition. You've mentioned pain points like high fees, poor integration, and weak reporting. For your media messaging, how do you typically position PayStream's differentiation? What's your core value prop that resonates most with SaaS companies versus professional services? Understanding this helps frame the creative strategy when we get to channels.

Turn 15:
Great question - LinkedIn targeting should be multi-layered for maximum precision, especially with that $960K investment.

**LINKEDIN TARGETING STRATEGY:**

**SaaS Segment ($660K):**
- **Job Titles:** CEO, CFO, VP Operations, Head of Finance (small companies) + Operations Manager, Finance Director (mid-size)
- **Firmographics:** Software/SaaS industry, 10-500 employees, 2+ years company age
- **Intent Signals:** Payment processing, billing software, subscription management interests
- **Lookalike:** Seed with your best SaaS customer data

**Professional Services ($300K):**
- **Job Titles:** Managing Partner, Practice Owner, Operations Director, CFO
- **Firmographics:** Consulting, Marketing Services, Professional Services, 5-200 employees  
- **Intent Signals:** Invoicing, cash flow management, client billing

The beauty is LinkedIn's firmographic data lets you layer company characteristics (revenue range, employee count, industry) with decision-maker titles. For SaaS especially, you can target "Software companies with 10-500 employees" AND "CFO/Finance roles" simultaneously.

Would you want to start broader for learning, then narrow based on activation data by job title and company size?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 14:
Smart thinking on weighting toward LinkedIn's superior activation rates. Here's my recommended channel allocation:

**CHANNEL STRATEGY BY SEGMENT:**

**TOTAL ALLOCATION:**
- LinkedIn: $960K (48%) - Your efficiency leader
- Google Ads: $780K (39%) - Intent capture across segments  
- Programmatic B2B: $260K (13%) - Scale testing and learning

This prioritizes your best-performing channel while building programmatic learnings. Sound strategic?
