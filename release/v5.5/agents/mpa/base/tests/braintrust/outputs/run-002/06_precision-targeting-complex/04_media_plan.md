# Media Plan Output: Precision Targeting with Complex Attributes

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I am excited to build a media plan with you. We will cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Your setup is impressive - targeting HNW individuals with $1M+ investable assets, 2,500 qualified leads from $1.5M budget, and strong CRM data for modeling. The precision approach is exactly right for wealth management.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 2,500 qualified leads? For example, are you targeting a certain number of new client conversions, AUM growth target, or revenue milestone?

Turn 2:
Perfect. $1.5M budget targeting $500M in new AUM through 300-375 client conversions - that's a clear growth objective with strong historical backing.

$1.5M / 2,500 leads = $600 per qualified lead. With your 12-15% lead-to-client conversion rate, that implies $4,000-5,000 per new client acquisition cost.

Given that your average new client brings $1.8M in AUM, this efficiency looks very strong for wealth management. Industry benchmarks for HNW acquisition typically run $3,000-8,000 per client depending on channel mix and precision.

How much revenue does LuxeFinance typically generate from a new $1.8M client relationship in the first year? This helps us validate whether your $4,000-5,000 acquisition cost creates positive unit economics.

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it. I'll model using $20K first-year revenue based on your 1-1.2% fee estimate. At $4,000-5,000 CAC, that projects to a 4-5x first-year revenue multiple, which is healthy for wealth management before factoring in relationship growth and retention.

$20K annual revenue / $4,500 blended CAC = 4.4x first-year return

This efficiency target is achievable but requires precision execution given the narrow HNW audience. Your 50K client CRM for lookalike modeling is a major advantage here.

Now let's define your target audience precisely. You mentioned $1M+ investable assets, ages 45-65, executives and business owners approaching retirement or liquidity events, researching tax optimization and estate planning.

What behavioral signals beyond research topics help you identify someone who's genuinely ready to move assets versus just browsing? For example, do they typically engage with specific content types, attend certain events, or show other intent indicators?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Perfect. NYC (25-30%), SF (20%), and Chicago (15%) as your core markets makes strategic sense given proven performance and sector concentration.

That allocates 60-65% of budget to your top three markets, leaving 35-40% for the remaining seven DMAs. Based on your $1.5M budget, we're looking at approximately:

- NYC: $375-450K  
- SF: $300K
- Chicago: $225K
- Remaining 7 DMAs: $525-600K combined

Before we map the full geography allocation, what's your minimum viable spend threshold per DMA? Some wealth management campaigns need $50-75K minimum per market to achieve meaningful reach against HNW audiences, while others can work effectively with smaller allocations.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 4:
Excellent - those are strong intent signals that indicate genuine readiness to engage. Multiple content downloads within 30 days showing 3x higher conversion rates is particularly valuable for optimization.

Your behavioral signals paint a clear picture: advanced content engagement (calculators, guides, market reports), advisor/location research, clustered engagement patterns, and major life event content consumption.

Given your target DMAs (NYC, SF, LA, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Denver, Miami, Dallas, DC), which 2-3 markets typically produce your highest-value clients or strongest conversion rates? This helps us understand where to weight investment for maximum efficiency within your precision approach.

Turn 6:
Smart approach. $75K minimum per DMA ensures meaningful reach against HNW audiences rather than ineffective thin coverage.

Let's map this out:
- NYC: $400K (27%)
- SF: $300K (20%) 
- Chicago: $225K (15%)
- Boston: $200K (13%)
- Seattle: $200K (13%)
- Dallas: $175K (12%)

Total: $1.5M across 6 DMAs with $100K+ minimum each

This concentration strategy should generate much stronger frequency and breakthrough against your target audience than spreading across all 10 markets.

Now, what's your current understanding of LuxeFinance's value proposition that resonates most with prospects during major life transitions? Is it specialized expertise, personalized service, investment performance, or something else that typically closes these HNW relationships?

Turn 7:
Excellent - that integrated approach addressing coordination pain points is a compelling differentiator for HNW prospects managing complex financial situations.

Your value proposition of "comprehensive wealth planning during major transitions" with coordinated tax optimization, estate planning, and succession under one roof directly addresses the fragmented advisor problem. The direct advisor access reinforces the premium positioning.

Now let's validate your budget efficiency. With $1.5M targeting 2,500 qualified leads across 6 concentrated DMAs, we need tight execution to hit $600 per qualified lead in these premium markets.

HNW media typically runs higher CPMs due to audience scarcity. Based on your 50K client CRM for lookalike modeling and strong intent signals, are you confident this $600 cost per qualified lead is achievable, or should we model scenarios at different efficiency levels to stress-test the plan?

Turn 8:
Smart thinking. Let me model those scenarios:

**Base Case:** $600 CPL = 2,500 leads (your original target)
**Conservative:** $750 CPL = 2,000 leads  
**Pessimistic:** $900 CPL = 1,667 leads

At your 12-15% conversion rates:
- 2,500 leads → 300-375 clients → $540-675M AUM
- 2,000 leads → 240-300 clients → $432-540M AUM  
- 1,667 leads → 200-250 clients → $360-450M AUM

Even the conservative scenario gets you close to your $500M AUM target. The pessimistic case falls short but still delivers meaningful growth.

Given your current $400-800 CPL range across channels, the $600-750 range feels achievable with precision targeting and your strong lookalike data.

Should we plan the campaign architecture around the conservative 2,000 lead target at $750 CPL? This builds in safety margin while still hitting your core business objective.

Turn 9:
Perfect. Conservative planning at 2,000 leads and $750 CPL gives you the buffer needed for HNW precision targeting while still hitting your $500M AUM objective.

Now let's define your audience with the precision this campaign demands. You've identified strong behavioral signals, but we need 20-30 specific targeting criteria for effective HNW reach.

Beyond your core demographics (45-65, $1M+ investable assets, executives/business owners), what additional signals help you identify prospects? For example:

- Specific job titles or company revenue thresholds
- Geographic micro-targeting (zip codes, neighborhoods)  
- Behavioral indicators (financial publication readership, event attendance)
- Life event triggers (business sale filings, inheritance, divorce)

What combination of these signals has proven most predictive in your existing client acquisition?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Excellent targeting precision. Your multi-signal approach with 3-4 criteria overlap driving 2x conversion rates is exactly what HNW campaigns need.

Let me organize your 20+ targeting signals:

**Professional:** C-suite, MDs, law/consulting partners, $10M+ revenue business owners
**Geographic:** $200K+ median income zip codes (Upper East Side, Palo Alto, Lincoln Park, etc.)
**Behavioral:** Barron's/WSJ/Financial Planning subscribers, wealth conference attendees
**Life Events:** Business sale filings, stock option exercises, $2M+ real estate transactions, divorce proceedings
**Intent:** Estate planning calculator usage, tax guide downloads, advisor bio engagement

Your 50K client CRM becomes powerful for creating lookalike audiences that naturally cluster these signals.

Given this precision targeting and your conservative $750 CPL planning, what channels have historically delivered your best cost-per-lead efficiency for reaching this specific audience profile?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Excellent channel performance data. LinkedIn at $500-650 CPL and premium programmatic at $600-800 CPL both align perfectly with your conservative $750 planning target.

Based on your historical performance and 2,000 lead target, here's a strategic allocation framework:

**LinkedIn (40% - $600K):** Core lead generation leveraging professional targeting
**Premium Programmatic (30% - $450K):** WSJ/Barron's contextual targeting  
**Connected TV (20% - $300K):** Awareness in high-income zip codes
**Podcast Sponsorships (10% - $150K):** High-engagement niche targeting

This projects approximately:
- LinkedIn: 1,000 leads at $600 CPL
- Programmatic: 600 leads at $750 CPL  
- Podcasts: 200 leads at $750 CPL
- CTV: Brand awareness + attribution lift

Does this allocation align with your channel preferences, or would you adjust the LinkedIn/programmatic split based on your capacity to scale those channels effectively?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 12:
Perfect adjustment. Avoiding LinkedIn saturation while scaling proven programmatic performance makes strategic sense.

**Revised allocation:**
- LinkedIn (35% - $525K): ~875 leads at $600 CPL
- Premium Programmatic (35% - $525K): ~700 leads at $750 CPL
- Connected TV (20% - $300K): Awareness + attribution lift
- Podcast Sponsorships (10% - $150K): ~200 leads at $750 CPL

Total: ~1,775 direct-attributed leads with CTV driving additional conversions through other channels.

Now for measurement - given your complex customer journey from awareness through multiple touchpoints to qualified lead, what's your current primary success metric? Are you optimizing campaigns toward cost-per-lead, lead-to-client conversion rates, or tracking something closer to actual AUM acquired?
