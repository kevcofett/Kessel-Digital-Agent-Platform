# Media Plan Output: Aggressive KPI - Must Narrow to Achieve

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks.

Perfect - you've given me excellent foundation data. Let me run the numbers on your efficiency target:

$750K / 5,000 customers = $150 CAC exactly

At $2,400 LTV, that's a 16x LTV/CAC ratio - exceptionally strong unit economics that gives us room to optimize.

Your $150 CAC target is aggressive but achievable for B2B SaaS. Based on industry benchmarks, typical B2B SaaS CACs range $200-400, so hitting $150 requires precise audience targeting and channel efficiency.

Before we dive into audience specifics, what's the primary business outcome you're trying to achieve with these 5,000 customers - is this about hitting a revenue milestone, proving scalability for investors, or expanding market presence?

Turn 3:
Perfect - new customer acquisitions at $150 CAC with funnel efficiency metrics supporting the scalability story. Your flexibility to $180 CAC if conversion rates are strong gives us realistic operating room.

Now let's assess if this efficiency is achievable. Based on your input:
- Target: $150 CAC  
- Stretch acceptable: $180 CAC
- Market reality: B2B SaaS typically $200-400

Your target is ambitious but not impossible. High-performing B2B SaaS campaigns hitting $150 CAC typically require:
- Surgical audience targeting (your SMB logistics managers are well-defined)
- Channel mix optimized for efficiency over reach
- Strong conversion funnel (which you're tracking)

One key question for modeling: What's your current sales cycle length from MQL to closed customer? This affects which channels can realistically deliver at your target efficiency.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Excellent - proving scalable acquisition efficiency for Series B is a clear objective that VCs understand. Your timing on logistics digitization is smart.

Your $150 CAC target is definitely aggressive for B2B SaaS - market typically shows $200-400 for this space. To hit your target, we'll need extremely tight audience definition and high channel efficiency. The good news is your 16x LTV/CAC ratio gives us cushion if we land closer to $180-200.

For your primary success metric, I'm assuming new customer acquisitions at or below $150 CAC. Is that correct, or do you have a different primary KPI you're tracking for the Series B story?

Turn 5:
Perfect - your 18 months of sales data gives us a huge advantage for precise targeting. Let's build the surgical audience definition you need to hit $7.87 per MQL.

Starting with your core ICP: SMB logistics managers at 50-500 employee companies with $5M-$50M revenue, currently on spreadsheets or legacy TMS.

To get granular enough for your efficiency targets, I need to understand the highest-converting segment within that broad group. Looking at your closed customers over the past 18 months, what company size or revenue range converts fastest from MQL to customer?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Excellent funnel data. Let me model your efficiency path:

15% MQL → SQL × 35% SQL → Customer = 5.25% overall MQL → Customer conversion

To get 5,000 customers, you need: 5,000 ÷ 0.0525 = 95,238 MQLs

At $750K budget: $750K ÷ 95,238 = $7.87 per MQL

That's a very tight MQL cost for B2B SaaS. Market typically shows $15-40 per MQL for logistics/operations software. Your target requires exceptional lead generation efficiency.

The 45-60 day cycle actually helps - it's fast enough for performance channels to optimize within campaign flights, unlike 6+ month enterprise cycles.

Your economics are complete and challenging but not impossible. The key will be precise audience targeting to drive down MQL costs.

Ready to move to Step 3 and define your target audience? We need surgical precision on those SMB logistics managers to hit your efficiency targets.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent - 100-250 employees, $10M-$25M revenue is your efficiency sweet spot. That's a much tighter target than your original 50-500 range, which should help drive down MQL costs significantly.

Now let's get specific about the decision makers within those companies. You mentioned dedicated logistics/operations managers with budget authority. What job titles convert best for you? Are we talking "Logistics Manager," "Operations Director," "Supply Chain Manager," or do you see other titles that consistently close?

Turn 7:
Perfect - "Logistics Manager," "Operations Manager," "Shipping Manager," and "Warehouse Manager" are your champion titles. These hands-on roles feeling daily spreadsheet pain are exactly who we need to target efficiently.

Let's add behavioral signals to sharpen targeting further. Beyond company size and titles, what specific pain points or situations make prospects most likely to convert quickly? For example, do you see patterns around seasonal shipping spikes, recent growth phases, specific industries within logistics, or technology adoption signals that indicate readiness to move off spreadsheets?

Turn 8:
Excellent behavioral signals - rapid growth (30%+ revenue), recent peak season pain, and outgrowing basic shipping tools are powerful conversion predictors.

Your audience is getting very precise:
- Companies: 100-250 employees, $10M-$25M revenue
- Titles: Logistics/Operations/Shipping/Warehouse Managers  
- Industries: E-commerce fulfillment, manufacturing with D2C, 3PLs
- Signals: Recent growth, seasonal pain, outgrowing ShipStation/Easyship

One final targeting layer: Are there specific geographic markets where you see higher conversion rates or faster sales cycles? Some regions have more mature logistics operations or different competitive landscapes that might affect your $150 CAC targets.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Perfect geographic focus - Tier 1 metro markets with strong logistics infrastructure will definitely help hit your efficiency targets. Atlanta and the I-85 corridor as your sweet spot makes total sense given the distribution density there.

Your audience definition is now surgically precise:
- Companies: 100-250 employees, $10M-$25M revenue, 30%+ growth
- Titles: Logistics/Operations/Shipping/Warehouse Managers
- Industries: E-commerce fulfillment, manufacturing D2C, 3PLs  
- Signals: Peak season pain, outgrowing basic tools
- Geography: Tier 1 metros, focus on Atlanta/Southeast, Dallas, Chicago, LA

This precision should significantly improve your MQL costs versus broad targeting. Ready to move to Step 4 and prioritize these geographic markets for budget allocation? We need to determine where to concentrate your $750K for maximum efficiency.

Turn 10:
Your geographic allocation is strategically sound. Let me break down the math:

- Atlanta/Southeast (40%): $300K
- Dallas (25%): $187.5K  
- Chicago (25%): $187.5K
- LA test (10%): $75K

This allocation makes sense for efficiency targeting. Concentrating 40% in your proven Atlanta market maximizes conversion likelihood while still allowing optimization in Dallas and Chicago.

However, given your aggressive $7.87 MQL target, you might consider going even more concentrated initially. What if we started with 50% Atlanta, 30% Dallas, 20% Chicago, and paused LA entirely until we prove efficiency in the core markets? 

The risk of spreading too thin across four markets is higher MQL costs everywhere. Better to dominate three markets efficiently than struggle in four.

What's your comfort level with being more concentrated versus maintaining market diversification for the Series B story?

Turn 11:
Perfect decision - concentrated efficiency over broad presence is exactly right for your Series B targets.

Final allocation:
- Atlanta/Southeast (50%): $375K
- Dallas (30%): $225K  
- Chicago (20%): $150K
- LA: Paused until Q3/Q4

This concentration should help you hit that aggressive $7.87 MQL cost by focusing spend where conversion rates are proven highest.

Your audience and geography are locked. Ready for Step 5 - Budget allocation? We need to determine how to split your budget between acquisition channels and any retention/expansion efforts, plus model budget pacing across your campaign timeline.

What's your planned campaign duration - are you running this $750K over the full year, or concentrating it in specific quarters?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 12:
Smart front-loading strategy for Series B timing. Let me model your pacing:

Q1-Q2 (60%): $450K → targeting 3,000 customers at $150 CAC
Q3-Q4 (40%): $300K → targeting 2,000 customers at $150 CAC

This gives you substantial early proof points for mid-year investor conversations, plus the option to accelerate if efficiency is proven.

One critical budget question: Is this $750K purely for media spend, or does it include creative production, landing page development, marketing automation tools, and attribution/measurement platforms? 

Given your surgical targeting requirements and 45-60 day sales cycle, you'll need robust creative assets and nurture sequences. If the $750K needs to cover everything, we should allocate 15-20% for creative and tech stack, leaving $600-640K for pure media spend.

What's included in your $750K budget?

Turn 13:
Excellent adjustment - being realistic about total budget allocation is crucial for hitting efficiency targets.

Revised model:
- Total budget: $750K
- Creative/tech: $150K (20%)
- Pure media spend: $600K
- Target customers: 4,000 at $150 CAC
- Required MQLs: 76,190 at $7.87 per MQL

This is still aggressive but more achievable than the original 5,000 customer target.

For budget pacing with your front-loaded strategy:
- Q1-Q2 media: $360K (60% of $600K)
- Q3-Q4 media: $240K (40% of $600K)

Ready for Step 6 - Value Proposition? To hit $7.87 MQL costs, your messaging needs to immediately resonate with those logistics managers feeling spreadsheet pain. What's your current primary value proposition, and how are you positioning against staying on spreadsheets versus competitors like legacy TMS systems?

Turn 14:
Excellent value prop - "Stop losing money on shipping errors" with quantified 15-20% savings is exactly what drives conversions at your efficiency targets. The hidden cost angle against spreadsheets and speed advantage against legacy TMS creates clear differentiation.

"Get TMS power without TMS pain" is particularly strong for your surgical audience - logistics managers who need enterprise functionality but can't handle enterprise complexity.

Your messaging framework is solid for conversion. Now let's build the channel strategy to deliver those 76,190 MQLs at $7.87 each.

Ready for Step 7 - Channels? Given your surgical B2B audience, tight geographic focus, and aggressive MQL costs, we need channels that excel at precise targeting and efficient lead generation. What channels are you currently using, and what's been your best performing channel for MQL generation so far?

Turn 15:
Great foundation - LinkedIn at $12-15 MQL is solid quality but needs optimization for your targets. Let me analyze your channel efficiency challenge:

Current performance vs. target:
- LinkedIn: $12-15 MQL (need to get to ~$6-8 to blend down)
- Search: High-intent but expensive CPCs
- G2/Capterra: Inconsistent but worth optimizing

To hit $7.87 blended MQL cost, you need a mix of:
1. **Optimized LinkedIn** - tighter targeting, better creative, account-based approaches
2. **Lower-cost channels** to blend down costs - programmatic display, email lists, content syndication
3. **Efficiency plays** - retargeting, lookalike audiences from your best customers

Given your surgical audience (logistics managers at 100-250 employee companies) and geographic concentration, what's your appetite for testing programmatic channels that can target job titles and company size at scale? These typically run $3-8 MQL but require larger volume commitments.
