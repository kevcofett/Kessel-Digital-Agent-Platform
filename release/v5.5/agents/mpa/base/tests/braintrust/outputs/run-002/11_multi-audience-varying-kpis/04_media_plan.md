# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience with Different KPIs Per Segment

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build this multi-segment media plan with you. This is sophisticated - three distinct objectives with different measurement frameworks and customer lifecycles. We'll still cover our ten areas (Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, Risks) but we'll address each segment's unique requirements.

Let me start with your outcomes to ensure I understand the success definition for each segment correctly.

For **Conquest (Awareness)**: When you say "shift consideration," what's the primary KPI you'll use to measure success? Brand lift studies, aided/unaided awareness, or consideration intent surveys?

Turn 2:
Perfect. Brand lift studies give you the cleanest measurement for long-term consideration shifts, especially against established competitors. That's the right approach for a 2-3 year purchase cycle.

Now for **In-Market (Lead Gen)**: You mentioned VDP views, form fills, calls, and test drive appointments. Which of these is your primary KPI - the one you'll optimize campaigns toward? And do you have a target volume for your primary KPI across all 12 dealerships?

Turn 4:
Excellent. Service appointments as the primary KPI makes perfect sense - consistent touchpoint and clear retention indicator. Reactivating lapsed customers is smart targeting since acquisition costs are typically 5-7x higher than retention.

Now let's tackle economics for each segment. Starting with **In-Market (Lead Gen)** since it has the clearest path to revenue:

With 45% of your $4.5M budget, that's roughly $2M for lead generation. Do you have a sense of what you can afford to spend per test drive appointment? This could come from your average sale value, close rates, or current cost per appointment if you're running digital now.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it. Test drive appointments are the right primary KPI - highest intent and direct handoff to your BDC team. I'll model based on reasonable assumptions for now and you can refine when your DMS analysis is complete.

For **Loyalty (Retention)**: You mentioned service appointments, trade-in inquiries, and lease renewals. Which is your primary KPI for this segment? And roughly what's your target - are you looking to increase retention rates, reactivate lapsed customers, or drive specific action volumes?

Turn 6:
Smart approach. 6-8 frequency per month against competitor owners will drive meaningful brand lift - much more effective than light reach for consideration shifts.

At $15 CPM (premium for precise competitor targeting), your $1.6M projects to approximately 107M impressions. With 6-8 monthly frequency, that suggests reaching roughly 450K-600K competitor vehicle owners consistently. That's substantial pressure against your target consideration set.

For **Loyalty (Retention)** with $900K (20% of budget): Customer reactivation typically runs much more efficiently since you have first-party data. What can you afford to spend to bring a lapsed customer back for a service appointment? Your existing customer data should make this highly targetable.

Turn 7:
Perfect. $900K ÷ $60 average = 15,000 reactivated service appointments, which falls right in your projected range. Your first-party data advantage makes this segment highly efficient.

Now let's assess if these efficiency targets are realistic across all three segments:

**In-Market**: $200 per test drive appointment is achievable but requires tight audience definition and channel selection. Automotive lead gen typically runs $150-300 depending on competition and targeting precision.

**Conquest**: 6-8 frequency at $15 CPM against competitor owners is aggressive but defensible for brand lift objectives. You'll need premium inventory and precise audience modeling.

**Loyalty**: $60 per reactivated service appointment is very achievable with your CRM data - retention campaigns typically outperform acquisition by 3-5x.

The economics look sound across all segments. Ready to move to audience definition, starting with your most complex segment - Conquest competitor targeting?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Got it. I'll model using $200 per test drive appointment based on typical dealer group benchmarks - that falls in your range and aligns with industry standards for multi-brand operations.

$2M budget ÷ $200 per appointment = 10,000 test drive appointments projected across your 12 dealerships. That's approximately 833 appointments per location annually, which seems reasonable for active lead generation.

For **Conquest (Awareness)** with $1.6M (35% of budget): Brand lift campaigns typically run $8-15 CPM depending on channels. What's your target reach against competitor vehicle owners? Are you looking to reach them 1-2 times per month, or building for higher frequency over the campaign period?

Turn 8:
Excellent targeting strategy. You're right that brand loyalists are waste - you need the "brand switchers" who are actually persuadable.

For your Conquest audience, I'm seeing these key behavioral signals:
- Current competitive vehicle ownership (Toyota, Honda, Ford, Chevy)
- Multi-brand purchase history (indicates switching behavior)
- Vehicle age 4-6 years (approaching consideration window)
- Younger demographics (less brand loyalty)

A few clarifying questions:

Are you targeting specific age ranges? Typically 25-45 shows highest switching behavior, but curious about your experience.

And for the multi-brand history signal - are you looking for people who've owned different brands sequentially, or does household-level brand diversity count? (For example, Toyota owner married to someone with a Ford)

Turn 9:
Perfect. Age 28-50 captures the sweet spot of purchasing power plus brand flexibility. And household-level brand diversity is smart - it shows the decision-makers aren't locked into single-brand thinking.

Your Conquest audience definition:
- Age: 28-50
- Current competitive vehicle ownership (Toyota, Honda, Ford, Chevy, others)
- Vehicle age: 4-6 years (approaching consideration)
- Multi-brand history: Individual sequential OR household-level brand diversity
- Behavioral: Active in automotive research/consideration (browsing, reviews, comparisons)

This creates a highly qualified but still scalable audience for your brand lift objectives.

Now for **In-Market (Lead Gen)**: These are active shoppers on Autotrader, Cars.com, researching reviews. What's your ideal profile here - are you targeting specific price ranges, vehicle types, or geographic proximity to your 12 dealerships? And any age parameters different from Conquest?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 11:
Perfect. Your Loyalty targeting leverages the existing relationship while focusing on natural reactivation triggers.

**Loyalty audience definition**:
- Existing customers in CRM database
- Service gap: 12+ months since last service
- Milestone targeting: Approaching 60K, 90K mile intervals or warranty expiration
- Geographic: All customers, but expect higher response within 50 miles
- Competitive context: Currently servicing elsewhere (independents, quick-lube chains)

Now let's move to geography. You have 12 dealerships across 3 brands - are these clustered in specific metro areas, or spread across a larger region? This affects how we structure geographic targeting, especially for the tight radius requirements on In-Market lead gen.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Excellent. Your In-Market targeting is much more inclusive on demographics but tighter on geography and behavior - exactly right for lead generation.

**In-Market audience definition**:
- Age: 25-65 (broader for active shoppers)
- Geographic: 25-30 mile radius around all 12 dealerships
- Price consideration: $20K-$80K (matches inventory)
- High-intent behaviors: Active on Autotrader, Cars.com, VDP views, comparison shopping
- Timeline: Shopping now (0-90 days)

This should provide strong volume for your 10,000 test drive appointment target while maintaining quality through geographic and behavioral filters.

For **Loyalty (Retention)**: You mentioned existing customers who've gone dark. Are you targeting based on specific timeframes - like customers who haven't serviced in 12+ months, or approaching warranty expiration? And any geographic considerations, or do you target all existing customers regardless of distance since they already have a relationship?

Turn 12:
Excellent point. Two distinct metros 120 miles apart definitely require separate targeting strategies, especially with different competitive landscapes and consumer behaviors.

**Geographic structure**:
- **Primary Metro**: 7 dealerships, premium positioning, higher turnover
- **Secondary Metro**: 5 dealerships, price-sensitive, longer cycles  
- **In-Market targeting**: Separate 25-30 mile radius clusters around each dealership
- **Conquest**: Different competitive sets and media consumption by metro

This geographic split impacts budget allocation too. Should we weight spending toward the primary metro given the 7 vs 5 dealership split and higher turnover, or do you prefer equal per-location investment? 

Also, for Conquest awareness - are the competitive brands the same in both markets, or does secondary metro have different dominant players that require adjusted messaging?

Turn 13:
Perfect. The 60/40 budget split makes complete sense given the performance differential and dealership count.

**Budget allocation by geography**:
- **Primary Metro**: $2.7M (60%) - 7 dealerships, premium competition
- **Secondary Metro**: $1.8M (40%) - 5 dealerships, volume competition

**Competitive context**:
- **Primary**: Lexus, Acura, premium German brands require premium positioning
- **Secondary**: Toyota, Honda, Ford, Chevy require value/reliability messaging

This sets us up for different media strategies - primary metro likely needs more premium inventory and sophisticated targeting, while secondary can focus on broader reach and value messaging.

With geography defined, let's move to your $4.5M budget allocation. We have the 60/40 geographic split and your 35/45/20 segment split. Should I calculate the budget matrix across both dimensions, or do you want to adjust the segment percentages differently between metros given the competitive differences?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 14:
Perfect. Here's your complete budget matrix:

**PRIMARY METRO ($2.7M total)**:
- Conquest (35%): $945K
- In-Market (45%): $1,215K  
- Loyalty (20%): $540K

**SECONDARY METRO ($1.8M total)**:
- Conquest (35%): $630K
- In-Market (45%): $810K
- Loyalty (20%): $360K

**SEGMENT TOTALS**:
- Conquest: $1,575K ($945K + $630K)
- In-Market: $2,025K ($1,215K + $810K)
- Loyalty: $900K ($540K + $360K)

This gives you clean budget buckets for each segment-market combination while maintaining consistent strategic priorities across both metros.

Now for value proposition - this is where the competitive differences really matter. For Primary Metro conquest against Lexus/Acura/German brands, what's your core value prop? Premium experience at accessible pricing, or something else that differentiates against luxury competition?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 15:
Excellent positioning. "Smart luxury" hits the rational buyer who wants premium without the long-term financial penalty. Total cost of ownership is a powerful differentiator against luxury brands.

For **Secondary Metro conquest** against Toyota/Honda/Ford/Chevy - what's your value proposition there? Are you positioning on reliability, value, local service advantage, or something else that breaks through against those volume leaders?

Turn 16:
Perfect. "Local ownership advantage" creates emotional differentiation against corporate chains - smart positioning that volume brands can't replicate.

**Value propositions defined**:
- **Primary Metro**: "Premium experience without the premium price trap" - smart luxury vs. Lexus/German brands
- **Secondary Metro**: "Local ownership advantage" - hometown relationships vs. corporate chains

Now let's move to channels. Given your three distinct objectives and two markets, we need different channel strategies:

For **Conquest (Brand Lift)** - you need sustained frequency against competitor owners. Are you thinking traditional reach channels like CTV/OTT, radio, OOH for broad awareness, or more targeted digital channels for precise competitor targeting? The 6-8 monthly frequency requirement suggests you need channels that can deliver consistent reach.
