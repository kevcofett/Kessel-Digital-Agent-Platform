USER:
Hi! I'm looking to get more people to buy shoes from our online store. Can you help me figure out the best way to do that?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve? For example, are you looking to get a certain number of new customers, hit a revenue target, or grow your overall shoe sales by a specific amount?

TURN 2 (Step 1)

USER:
We want to grow our overall shoe sales and get more new customers. I'd say we're hoping to increase our sales by maybe 30-40% this year, but I'm not totally sure what that translates to in exact numbers of customers or revenue yet.

AGENT:
Great! A 30-40% growth target shows solid ambition. To help make this concrete, I need to understand your current baseline.

What were your total shoe sales last year - either in revenue dollars or number of customers? This will help us figure out exactly what 30-40% growth means in real numbers.

USER:
We did about $800,000 in sales last year, and I think we had around 3,200 customers but I'm not 100% sure on that number. So if we want to grow 30-40%, we'd be looking at getting to maybe $1.1 million or so in sales this year.

AGENT:
Perfect! So you're targeting around $300,000 in additional sales to reach that $1.1 million goal.

Now I need to understand how we'll measure success. What's the main number you'll track to know if this campaign is working? For example, will you focus on total new customers acquired, total revenue from the campaign, or something else like return on your ad spend?
