# Media Plan Output: Basic User - Steps 1-2 Completion

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve? For example, are you looking to get a certain number of new customers, hit a revenue target, or grow your overall shoe sales by a specific amount?

Turn 2:
Great! A 30-40% growth target shows solid ambition. To help make this concrete, I need to understand your current baseline.

What were your total shoe sales last year - either in revenue dollars or number of customers? This will help us figure out exactly what 30-40% growth means in real numbers.

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Perfect! So you're targeting around $300,000 in additional sales to reach that $1.1 million goal.

Now I need to understand how we'll measure success. What's the main number you'll track to know if this campaign is working? For example, will you focus on total new customers acquired, total revenue from the campaign, or something else like return on your ad spend?
