# Media Plan Output: Brand Building with Limited Data

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect starting context - natural supplements, West Coast expansion, brand awareness focus with $500K. Since this is a new market launch, we'll model using industry benchmarks where historical data isn't available.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with this West Coast launch? For example, are you aiming for a certain number of new customers, a revenue target, or market share milestone by a specific date?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Great! So your objective is brand awareness among health-conscious West Coast consumers, and you're thinking 10,000 new customers as a starting target.

For brand awareness campaigns, we need to define how we'll measure success as a number. This could be brand recognition percentage (like "40% of target audience recognizes GreenLeaf"), website traffic increase, or actual customer acquisition if that's the real goal.

Since you mentioned 10,000 new customers, it sounds like customer acquisition might be your primary success metric rather than pure brand awareness. Which matters more - people knowing your brand name, or people actually buying your products?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Perfect! Customer acquisition is your primary objective with 10,000 new customers as your target. That gives us a clear success metric to work with.

Now let's check if your efficiency target is realistic. With your $500K budget targeting 10,000 customers:

$500K ÷ 10,000 = $50 per customer

That means you need to acquire each new customer for $50 or less. For natural supplements, this is tight but achievable if your products have good margins.

Do you know roughly how much profit you make on a typical first purchase, or what an average customer spends with you over time? This helps us confirm whether $50 per customer leaves you profitable.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using $75 average order value with typical supplement margins of 60-70%, giving roughly $45-50 profit per first purchase. With repeat customers every 2-3 months, your customer lifetime value likely exceeds $200. You can refine these numbers anytime.

At $50 customer acquisition cost versus $200+ lifetime value, that projects to a healthy 4x+ return ratio. Your $50 efficiency target is achievable for supplements with good creative and targeting.

Moving on to Step 2 economics - your plan looks mathematically sound. $500K should realistically deliver your 10,000 customers if we build tight audience definition and efficient channel mix.

Now for Step 3 - let's define your ideal customer. Beyond "health-conscious," what specific behaviors or characteristics describe someone most likely to buy GreenLeaf supplements?

Turn 5:
Excellent customer profile! Millennials and Gen Z aged 25-40 who are wellness-focused, ingredient-conscious, shop premium retailers like Whole Foods, and are already supplement users seeking natural upgrades.

To sharpen our targeting, what income level can typically afford $75+ supplement purchases regularly? And are there any specific wellness interests that make someone more likely to choose your products - like specific health goals, dietary preferences, or lifestyle choices?

Turn 6:
Perfect! $60K+ household income, clean eating/organic focus, plant-based dieters, natural solutions for stress/sleep/energy, plus holistic wellness over hardcore fitness. That's a well-defined target.

One more audience question: Are there any behaviors or interests that signal someone is ready to switch supplement brands? For example, do they research online, follow wellness influencers, read reviews, or show other signs they're actively seeking better options?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 7:
Excellent! Research-heavy consumers who read reviews, follow wellness influencers on Instagram/TikTok, participate in clean eating/natural health communities, and value ingredient transparency. They're brand-switchers motivated by quality over price.

That completes our audience definition. Now for Step 4 - geography. You mentioned California, Oregon, and Washington. Are there specific metro areas within those states that are priorities, or should we target the entire states? For example, are urban areas like LA, SF, Seattle, and Portland more important than rural regions?

Turn 8:
Smart prioritization! Major metros like LA, SF, Seattle, and Portland plus their suburban areas will have the highest concentrations of your target audience and supporting retail infrastructure.

That gives us solid geographic focus for efficient media buying. Urban and suburban areas also offer better digital targeting capabilities and more diverse channel options.

Step 4 complete. Now for Step 5 - budget allocation. With your $500K total budget, how would you like to split it? For example, should all metros get equal investment, or do some markets like LA (much larger) deserve bigger allocations? Also, any preference for how much to spend in the first 3 months versus saving budget for later in the 6-month campaign?
