# Media Plan Output: Full 10-Step Media Planning

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your business outcome. You mentioned acquiring 15,000 new customers - is customer acquisition your primary objective, or are there other business outcomes like revenue growth or market expansion that matter equally?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Customer acquisition as your primary objective with 15,000 new customers is clear. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success as a number.

$750K / 15,000 = $50 per customer acquisition cost. That's your implied efficiency target.

What's the primary metric you'll use to track progress toward that 15,000 customer goal? Are you measuring new customer conversions, first-time purchases, or something else specific?

Turn 4:
Perfect! Let me validate those economics:

**First purchase**: $185 AOV - $50 CAC = $135 immediate profit
**Lifetime value**: $450 LTV / $50 CAC = 9x ratio

That's exceptionally strong unit economics. Most home decor brands see 3-4x LTV/CAC ratios, so your 9x target suggests either very healthy margins or conservative CAC estimates.

With 60% repeat rate and $450 LTV, your $50 acquisition cost is highly achievable. This gives us solid foundation for channel selection and budget allocation.

Ready to move to Step 3 and define your target audience precisely?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent! So we have:
- **Objective**: Acquire 15,000 new customers  
- **Primary KPI**: First-time purchases
- **Target efficiency**: $50 per customer

Now let's assess if that $50 acquisition cost is realistic for home decor. What's the average order value for a first-time customer, and do customers typically make repeat purchases over time?

This helps us understand if $50 spend can generate profitable returns in your business.

Turn 5:
Great starting point! Let's sharpen that targeting to maximize your $50 efficiency.

Since you have existing customers, let's start with your highest-value segments. Looking at your current customer base, what patterns do you see? For example:

- Are there specific age ranges within that 30-55 group that spend more or return more frequently?
- Do you see differences between new homeowners, people renovating, or those just refreshing their decor?
- Any income level or lifestyle patterns among your best customers?

Your repeat customers especially - what characteristics do they share that might help us find more people like them?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 7:
Perfect! Those behavioral signals give us strong targeting precision. Let me summarize your audience definition:

**Demographics**: Ages 35-45, household income $75K+, homeowners
**Behavioral signals**: Active on Pinterest/Instagram, engage with home design content, follow interior design influencers, watch home improvement shows
**Interest targeting**: Home decor, interior design, renovation, seasonal decorating
**Life stage indicators**: Established careers, disposable income for home improvements
**Seasonal patterns**: Spring cleaning/decorating, fall holiday preparation

This creates a well-defined audience that should respond efficiently to your $50 CAC target.

Ready for Step 4? Let's define your geographic focus. You mentioned wanting to do better in current markets rather than expand - which specific regions or cities are you currently strongest in?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent insights! That 35-45 age range with $75K+ household income is a strong targeting foundation. The renovation vs. refresh distinction is valuable too - renovation customers with bigger initial purchases could be priority segments.

Now for behaviors and interests that help platforms find these people: What do your best customers typically engage with online? For example:

- Do they follow home improvement shows, interior design influencers, or specific home decor brands?
- Are they active on Pinterest, Instagram, home design websites?
- Any particular life events or seasonal patterns when they're most likely to purchase?

These behavioral signals help us reach similar prospects who aren't yet in your customer database.

Turn 8:
Excellent geographic focus! Doubling down on momentum markets is smart strategy. Those metros you mentioned - Atlanta, Dallas, Phoenix, Denver, plus West Coast and growing Southeast/Southwest cities - represent strong growth markets with your target demographics.

Let me clarify the scope: Are you looking at the full metro areas (DMAs) for places like Atlanta and Dallas, or more specific zip codes within those regions? 

Also, roughly what percentage of your current customer base comes from these priority markets versus everywhere else? This helps us allocate your $750K budget geographically.

Turn 9:
Perfect! That geographic focus gives us clear budget allocation logic:

**Priority markets (65-70% of budget)**: Atlanta, Dallas, Phoenix, Denver, LA, San Francisco, plus growing Southeast/Southwest metros
**Testing allocation (remaining 30-35%)**: Adjacent promising markets

With 70% of customers coming from priority markets, concentrating $525K there ($35 CAC equivalent) while using $225K for testing makes strategic sense.

Ready for Step 5? Let's establish your total budget framework. You mentioned $750K annually - is this flexible if performance exceeds expectations, or a firm cap? And how do you prefer to pace this - evenly throughout the year or heavier during your spring and fall seasonal peaks?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Smart budget approach! A firm $750K with seasonal weighting makes perfect sense:

**Seasonal allocation**: 40% during spring/fall peaks = $300K
**Baseline allocation**: 60% across other months = $450K

This projects roughly 6,000 customers during peak seasons and 9,000 during baseline periods, all at your $50 efficiency target.

Now for Step 6 - your value proposition. With home decor being a crowded space, what makes HomeStyle Decor different from competitors? Is it product quality, price point, unique style, customer service, or something else that gives you an edge in winning those first-time customers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Excellent value proposition! That "curated boutique quality at accessible prices" positioning is compelling for your target audience. The combination of unique selection, quality, and strong customer service creates real differentiation.

**Your value proposition**: Premium curated home decor with boutique aesthetics at accessible pricing, plus exceptional customer service

This should resonate strongly with your 35-45, $75K+ audience who want quality and style but aren't shopping luxury price points.

Ready for Step 7 - channel strategy? Given your audience behaviors (Pinterest/Instagram active, home design content consumers), seasonal patterns, and $50 efficiency target, which channels are you currently using, and what's working best for customer acquisition?

Turn 12:
Great foundation! Your current mix aligns well with your audience behaviors. Let me analyze what you have and identify opportunities:

**Current performance ranking** (based on your feedback):
1. Facebook/Instagram - strong audience fit
2. Google Search - captures intent well  
3. Pinterest - underoptimized opportunity
4. Influencer partnerships - working but unscaled

**Strategic recommendations for $750K allocation**:
- **Meta (FB/IG): 35-40%** - Your proven performer, scale efficiently
- **Google Search: 25-30%** - Capture existing demand, add Shopping
- **Pinterest: 15-20%** - Huge upside given your audience activity
- **Influencer: 10-15%** - Scale what's working
- **Testing budget: 5-10%** - YouTube, Connected TV, or programmatic

This targets roughly 10,500 customers from proven channels and 4,500 from optimization/testing.

Which of these allocations feels right, and are there any channels here you'd want to adjust?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 13:
Excellent question! For your testing allocation, I'd recommend starting with **YouTube** for these reasons:

**YouTube advantages for HomeStyle Decor**:
- Massive home design/renovation content consumption
- Your target demos (35-45, $75K+) are heavy YouTube users
- Visual format perfect for showcasing curated pieces
- Can target home design channel viewers and Pinterest users
- Typically $30-60 CACs for home/lifestyle brands

**Connected TV** would be my second choice - great for brand awareness during your seasonal peaks, but harder to track direct customer acquisition at your $50 efficiency target.

**Recommended testing approach**:
- Start with 5% to YouTube ($37.5K)
- Focus on In-Stream ads targeting home design content
- Test during spring peak to maximize seasonal lift
- If YouTube hits $50 CAC, expand and potentially test Connected TV

Ready for Step 8? Let's set up measurement and attribution to track your 15,000 customer target across all these channels.

Turn 14:
Excellent! Multi-channel measurement is critical for your $50 CAC target. Let me outline the measurement framework:

**Primary KPI**: First-time purchases (your 15,000 target)
**Attribution window**: Likely 7-day click, 1-day view (standard for home decor consideration cycles)

**Key tracking requirements**:
- UTM parameters for all channels to identify traffic sources
- First-party pixel tracking across Meta, Google, Pinterest, YouTube
- Customer tagging to prevent double-counting across platforms
- Incrementality testing (especially important with expanded channel mix)

**Red flag**: Platform-reported ROAS often inflates 20-40% due to attribution overlap. Your true performance will likely be lower than what each platform claims individually.

**Critical question**: Are you currently using server-side tracking or Google Analytics 4 enhanced ecommerce? And do you have a way to identify truly incremental new customers versus people who would have found you anyway?

Turn 15:
Smart assessment! Here are the critical measurement upgrades in priority order:

**Priority 1 - Server-side tracking**: Implement Conversions API for Meta and Google Enhanced Conversions. This recovers 15-25% of lost conversions from iOS14+ privacy changes and improves attribution accuracy.

**Priority 2 - Incrementality framework**: Start with simple geo-holdout tests. Run campaigns in 80% of your priority metros, hold out 20% as control group. Compare new customer rates between test/control markets.

**Priority 3 - Attribution deduplication**: Use GA4 as your source of truth, not platform reporting. Set up Data-Driven Attribution model in GA4 to better allocate credit across touchpoints.

**Quick win**: Implement first-party customer tagging immediately. Tag every new customer acquisition with their true first touch source, not last touch.

**Timeline recommendation**: Get server-side tracking live before launching YouTube and scaled Pinterest. The incrementality testing can start once you're spending across all channels.

Ready for Step 9? Let's design your testing strategy to optimize that $750K efficiently.

Turn 16:
Perfect! Here's your comprehensive testing strategy:

**Channel-level testing priorities**:
- **Meta**: Creative formats (video vs. carousel vs. static), audience expansion vs. precise targeting
- **Google**: Shopping campaigns vs. Search, broad match vs. exact match keywords  
- **Pinterest**: Fresh pin frequency, Story Pins vs. standard Pins
- **YouTube**: In-Stream vs. Discovery ads, 15-second vs. 30-second creative

**Cross-channel testing**:
- **Sequential messaging**: Pinterest for discovery → Meta for conversion
- **Budget allocation**: Test 40% Meta vs. 35% Meta, shift 5% to best performer
- **Seasonal weighting**: Test 45% spring/fall vs. 35% for peak optimization

**Testing budget allocation**:
- Reserve 10% of each channel budget for testing ($75K total)
- Run 2-week sprints with statistical significance targets
- Winner takes 80% of budget, continue testing with 20%

**Key question**: Would you prefer to test everything simultaneously when launching, or phase testing over quarters to manage complexity while your team builds measurement capabilities?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 10: Risks

Turn 17:
Excellent phased approach! That testing timeline perfectly balances optimization with operational reality:

**Q1**: Meta + Google optimization while launching Pinterest/YouTube
**Q2**: Cross-channel testing with robust tracking foundation  
**Q3-Q4**: Seasonal optimization and budget reallocation based on learnings

The 2-week sprint cadence gives you 26 testing cycles annually - plenty of optimization opportunities without overwhelming your team.

Ready for Step 10 - our final step? Let's identify the key risks that could derail your 15,000 customer target and build mitigation strategies. 

Based on everything we've discussed, what concerns you most about executing this plan? Is it the measurement complexity, scaling new channels, hitting that $50 efficiency target, or something else entirely?
