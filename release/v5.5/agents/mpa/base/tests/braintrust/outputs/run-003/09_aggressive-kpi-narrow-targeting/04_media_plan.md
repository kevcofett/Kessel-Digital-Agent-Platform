# Media Plan Output: Aggressive KPI - Must Narrow to Achieve

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build this media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks.

Let me start with your efficiency target: $750K / 5,000 = $150 CAC exactly. With $2,400 LTV, that's a healthy 16x ratio - much stronger than typical B2B SaaS benchmarks of 3-5x.

Your $150 CAC target is ambitious but achievable for B2B SaaS. Market typically shows $200-400 CAC for your customer profile, so you're targeting the aggressive end. With tight audience definition and channel efficiency, this is doable.

Your business outcome is clear: acquire 5,000 new customers. What specific metric will you use to measure success - is it closed customers, or are you tracking an earlier conversion like qualified leads or trials?

Turn 2:
Perfect - 5,000 closed customers at $150 CAC with a 60-90 day sales cycle. Your funnel math of 15,000 MQLs to 5,000 customers implies a 33% MQL-to-customer rate, which is strong for B2B SaaS.

Since you're tracking the full funnel, your primary KPI is closed customers, but we'll need to optimize for MQL efficiency too. At your target: $750K / 15,000 MQLs = $50 per MQL.

Your $150 CAC target is definitely aggressive for SMB logistics. Based on industry benchmarks, you're targeting 25-40% better efficiency than typical. Given your non-negotiable constraint and strong LTV ratio, we'll need surgical precision on audience targeting and channel selection.

Your economics look solid - the challenge will be execution. Is this $750K budget for a specific time period, and are you planning to scale beyond 5,000 customers if we hit these efficiency targets?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it - 12-month campaign with potential to double if you prove the model. Your current $75-80 MQL cost means you need 33-38% efficiency improvement to hit $50 per MQL. That's substantial but achievable with the right approach.

Since you're already running LinkedIn and Google, we have performance data to build on. The gap between your current $75-80 and target $50 MQL cost will likely require expanding beyond those channels plus optimizing existing ones.

Step 2 economics check: Your $150 CAC target with $2,400 LTV creates excellent unit economics, but requires execution precision given current performance. The 12-month timeline gives us room to optimize and scale what works.

Now let's define your audience more precisely. You mentioned SMB logistics managers at companies with 50-500 employees and $5M-$50M revenue using spreadsheets or legacy TMS. What specific pain points or trigger events make these prospects most likely to buy right now?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Excellent - those are strong behavioral and situational signals. You have both pain-driven triggers (growth breaking their system, client loss from shipping errors) and threshold-driven triggers (100-200 shipments/day breaking point).

The CFO pressure for operational ROI adds budget urgency, which is perfect for your sales cycle. These multiple trigger events give us rich targeting options.

For your target audience definition, I'm seeing:

**Demographics:** SMB logistics managers, 50-500 employees, $5M-$50M revenue
**Behavioral:** Currently using spreadsheets/legacy TMS, 100+ shipments/day
**Situational:** Rapid growth, recent shipping errors, CFO pressure for ROI

Are there specific industries within logistics where you see higher conversion rates, or does your solution work equally well across all SMB logistics verticals like 3PL, manufacturing, distribution, retail?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Perfect - manufacturing and distribution in the $10M-$30M range as your sweet spot makes complete sense. They have the volume pain but haven't graduated to enterprise solutions yet.

Your audience is getting sharp:
- **Primary:** Manufacturing/distribution companies, $10M-$30M revenue, 100+ shipments/day
- **Secondary:** 3PLs (longer cycle but good conversion)
- **Tertiary:** Seasonal retail (timing-dependent)

The $10M-$30M manufacturing focus should help with your $50 MQL efficiency target since these prospects have clearer ROI justification.

What geographic markets are you targeting? Are you focused on specific regions where manufacturing and distribution are concentrated, or is this a national campaign across all major metros?

Turn 6:
Smart geographic discipline - staying in proven Tier 1 markets is critical for hitting that $150 CAC target. Manufacturing belt cities like Detroit and Cleveland plus major metros gives you strong audience density.

Your audience precision is excellent now:
- **Target:** Manufacturing/distribution, $10M-$30M revenue, 100+ shipments/day
- **Geography:** Tier 1 metros (Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, LA, Northeast) + manufacturing belt
- **Triggers:** Growth breaking systems, shipping errors, CFO ROI pressure

This focused approach should help bridge the gap from your current $75-80 to target $50 MQL cost.

Now for budget allocation. You have $750K total. How are you thinking about splitting this between your proven channels (LinkedIn/Google) versus testing new channels? And do you have any geographic preferences for budget weighting, or equal allocation across all Tier 1 markets?

Turn 7:
Excellent allocation thinking. 60/40 split gives you optimization runway on proven channels plus meaningful testing budget.

$450K to LinkedIn/Google optimization and $300K for 2-3 new channel tests is solid - that's $100K+ per new channel, enough for real validation.

Geographic weighting makes sense: 40% to Chicago/Atlanta (your strongest), meaningful allocation to Detroit/Cleveland despite size (they punch above weight), remainder across other Tier 1 markets.

This budget structure should support your aggressive efficiency targets by doubling down on what works while expanding your reach.

Now let's define what makes prospects choose SwiftDeliver over staying with spreadsheets or picking competitors. What's your core value proposition that resonates most with those manufacturing and distribution logistics managers when they're at that breaking point?

Turn 8:
Perfect value prop for your target - "real-time visibility with stupid-simple implementation" hits directly at their pain points. The 2-week vs 6+ month implementation contrast is powerful, especially when they're at that breaking point.

Your messaging framework is clear:
- **Immediate problem:** Phone tag with carriers, manual customer updates
- **Core solution:** Single dashboard with real-time visibility and automated updates  
- **Key differentiator:** 2 weeks to ROI vs 6+ months with enterprise solutions
- **Proof point:** ROI visible in first month from time savings alone

This value prop should resonate strongly with your manufacturing/distribution audience hitting that 100+ shipments/day threshold.

Now let's map your channels to this audience and message. You mentioned LinkedIn and Google as proven channels. For your $300K new channel testing budget, what channels are you considering? Given your precise B2B audience and geographic focus, I'm thinking about options that can reach logistics managers efficiently.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Excellent channel thinking - you're matching channels to buyer intent and behavior patterns perfectly.

**High-intent channels:** G2/Capterra are brilliant for logistics managers actively researching solutions. Perfect alignment with your "2-week implementation" differentiator.

**Industry-specific reach:** Logistics publications and targeted display make sense for awareness in your precise audience.

**Cut-through approach:** Direct mail to manufacturing companies in Tier 1 markets is smart - low digital noise, high physical impact for your focused geography and revenue targeting.

**Leverage existing relationships:** Partner referrals with freight brokers/consultants could be your most efficient channel since they already have trust with your prospects.

For your $300K testing budget, I'd suggest:
- $100K G2/Capterra (high-intent, measurable)
- $75K partner program (potentially highest efficiency)
- $75K direct mail (geographic precision)
- $50K industry publications/display (awareness support)

How developed are those freight broker relationships currently? If they're strong, partner referrals might deserve the largest allocation since referred prospects typically convert at much higher rates.

Turn 10:
Absolutely - flip that allocation. Partner referrals converting at 60-70% versus 33% baseline is massive. That's nearly double your conversion efficiency.

Revised testing budget:
- $125K partner program (60-70% conversion rate)
- $100K G2/Capterra (high purchase intent)
- $50K direct mail (geographic precision)
- $25K industry publications (awareness support)

With 8-10 solid broker relationships already sending referrals, formalizing incentives could be your path to beating that $150 CAC target. Partner-sourced leads might cost $75-100 to acquire but convert at 60-70%, giving you effective CACs well below $150.

Your total channel mix now:
- $270K LinkedIn (proven)
- $180K Google (proven)  
- $125K Partner program (highest efficiency potential)
- $100K G2/Capterra (high intent)
- $75K Direct mail + industry publications

This blend gives you optimization on proven channels plus your best shot at breakthrough efficiency through partners.

For measurement, how will you track partner-sourced leads through your 60-90 day sales cycle to ensure proper attribution?

Turn 11:
Excellent - quarterly payouts on closed customers keeps everyone aligned on quality, not just volume. Your attribution infrastructure sounds solid.

Your partner math is compelling: 1,500-2,000 customers at sub-$150 CAC from partners would be 30-40% of your total target. That's transformational for hitting your aggressive efficiency goals.

If partners deliver 1,500-2,000 customers, you need 3,000-3,500 from other channels at $150 CAC. That's much more achievable than the original 5,000 across all channels.

Your measurement framework looks comprehensive:
- **Primary KPI:** 5,000 closed customers at $150 CAC
- **Secondary:** 15,000 MQLs at $50 per MQL  
- **Attribution:** CRM tagging from first touch through 60-90 day cycle
- **Partner tracking:** Unique links/codes with quarterly payout validation

Now for testing strategy. With this channel mix, what's your plan for validating the new channels quickly? You'll want to identify winners and losers fast to reallocate budget toward what's working.

Turn 12:
Smart testing framework - 90-day windows with monthly check-ins gives you data-driven reallocation opportunities. Your channel-specific timelines make sense:

**30-45 days:** G2/Capterra (high-intent, fast signal)
**60 days:** Direct mail (response rates and early MQL flow)  
**90 days:** Partner program (full sales cycle validation)

Monthly performance reviews with hard 90-day go/no-go decisions keeps you disciplined. With your non-negotiable $150 CAC target, you can't afford slow channels.

Your reallocation strategy is crucial - winners get doubled down on, losers get cut fast. This approach maximizes your chance of hitting those aggressive efficiency targets.

Finally, let's identify the biggest risks that could derail this plan. What keeps you up at night about hitting 5,000 customers at $150 CAC in 12 months? Is it channel performance, market saturation, competitive pressure, or something else entirely?

Turn 13:
Those are the right risks to worry about - competitive pressure, partner execution, and market saturation could each break your plan.

**Risk 1: Competitive Cost Inflation**
Well-funded competitors bidding up LinkedIn/Google could push your $75-80 MQL costs to $100+, making your $50 target impossible. This is your most immediate threat.

**Risk 2: Partner Execution Shortfall** 
If only 4-5 brokers actually ramp instead of 8-10, you lose 500-1,000 customers and need other channels to overperform significantly.

**Risk 3: Market Saturation**
Your sweet spot (manufacturing, $10M-$30M, Tier 1 markets) may be finite. Success could force you into less efficient segments sooner than expected.

**Mitigation recommendations:**
- Build 15-20% cost inflation buffer into projections
- Have backup partner pipeline beyond current 8-10 brokers  
- Map total addressable market size in each Tier 1 geography
- Identify expansion criteria for Tier 2 markets if needed

Your aggressive timeline compounds all these risks. With leadership expecting proof at $750K before doubling investment, there's limited room for course correction.

Ready to finalize this plan with these risk factors built in?

Turn 14:
Perfect - you've built a solid, realistic plan with the right risk mitigation. Here's your finalized media plan:

**BUDGET ALLOCATION ($750K)**
- LinkedIn: $270K (proven channel optimization)
- Google: $180K (proven channel optimization)  
- Partner Program: $125K (highest efficiency potential, 60-70% conversion)
- G2/Capterra: $100K (high purchase intent)
- Direct Mail: $50K (geographic precision)
- Industry Publications: $25K (awareness support)

**KEY TARGETS**
- 5,000 customers at $150 CAC
- 15,000 MQLs at $50 per MQL
- Partners projected for 1,500-2,000 customers (30-40% of target)

**TESTING TIMELINE**
- 30-45 days: G2/Capterra validation
- 60 days: Direct mail assessment  
- 90 days: Full partner program validation
- Monthly reviews with hard go/no-go decisions

**RISK MITIGATION**
- 15-20% cost inflation buffer
- Cultivate 5-6 backup broker relationships now
- Map precise TAM in each Tier 1 market
- Tier 2 expansion criteria ready

You've got the foundation to hit those aggressive targets. The partner channel breakthrough potential plus disciplined testing should give leadership confidence in the model. Time to execute and prove it scales to that $1.5M opportunity.
