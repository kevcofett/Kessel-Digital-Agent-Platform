# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience with Different KPIs Per Segment

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build this multi-segment media plan with you. This is sophisticated work - three distinct objectives with different measurement frameworks and customer lifecycles. We'll cover the same ten areas but adapt for your segmented approach.

Let me start with Segment 1 (Conquest/Awareness) since brand consideration drives your long-term pipeline.

With roughly 35% of $4.5M ($1.58M), what specific awareness outcome are you targeting? Are you looking to achieve a certain reach percentage among competitor vehicle owners, brand lift points, or consideration shift metrics in your markets?

Turn 2:
Perfect. 70% reach with meaningful frequency among competitor owners is a solid foundation, and 3-5 point brand lift targets give us clear success benchmarks even if tracking isn't systematic yet.

$1.58M for conquest awareness - that's substantial reach capacity. Quick calculation: if we model competitor owners at roughly 40-50% of your total addressable market, we're looking at significant scale across 12 dealerships.

For Segment 2 (In-Market Lead Gen), you allocated roughly 45% ($2.03M). What's your target volume for leads - VDP views, form fills, calls, and test drive appointments? And do you have a sense of what you can afford per lead based on your typical conversion rates and unit economics?

Turn 4:
Excellent. Let me model this quickly:

$900K across your retention targets:
- 2,250 service appointments (midpoint) = $400 per appointment
- 1,000 trade-in inquiries (midpoint) = $900 per inquiry  
- 500 lease renewals (midpoint) = $1,800 per renewal

Given your value ranges ($300 service, $3,000+ trade-in), these efficiencies look very achievable, especially since you're targeting existing customers with established relationships.

Now I need to assess if your overall targets are realistic. Your three segments require different approaches:

**Conquest**: 70% reach needs mass channels (likely TV, digital video, OOH)
**In-Market**: 10,000 leads needs performance channels (SEM, social, automotive sites)  
**Loyalty**: Retention actions need direct channels (email, CRM, targeted digital)

Before we dive into audience definition, are these three segments operating in the same geographic markets, or do different dealerships serve different territories that would affect our media strategy?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it. 10,000 qualified leads annually is a clear target. $2.03M / 10,000 = $203 per lead - that falls right in your current $150-400 range, which suggests realistic efficiency.

The attribution gap between DMS and CRM is common in automotive. I'll model using $203 per lead based on your budget, and we can flag attribution improvement as a measurement priority.

For Segment 3 (Loyalty/Retention), you allocated 20% ($900K). What volume are you targeting for retention actions - service appointments, trade-in inquiries, lease renewals? And roughly how many existing customers are in your addressable retention pool across all 12 dealerships?

Turn 5:
Perfect - that geographic layering makes complete sense. Conquest gets metro-wide reach, in-market stays dealership-local, and loyalty works from your owned database.

With 12 dealerships across 50-mile radii, you're likely covering multiple DMAs. That geographic complexity will affect media buying and measurement across segments.

Now let's define your audiences more precisely, starting with Segment 1 (Conquest). 

You want to reach competitor vehicle owners for awareness. Are you targeting owners of specific competing brands (Toyota, Honda, Ford, etc.), or broader categories like "non-luxury sedan owners" or "truck owners"? The more specific we get, the better we can estimate that 70% reach target and choose the right channels.

Turn 7:
Perfect. SUVs/trucks at 70% focus aligns with market demand, and your behavioral signals (multiple research touchpoints, 2-4 weeks in-market, $40K+ HHI) create a qualified prospect profile that should hit that $203 per lead efficiency.

For Segment 3 (Loyalty), you're working from your 45,000-customer database. Do you have data signals that help identify which customers are most likely to need each retention action? For example, service history for appointment targeting, lease end dates for renewals, or vehicle age/mileage for trade-in timing?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Excellent targeting precision. Toyota/Honda/Nissan/Hyundai owners (60% focus) plus Ford/Chevy truck owners (40% focus) gives us clear audience definition for that 70% reach goal.

For Segment 2 (In-Market), you need 10,000 qualified leads from active vehicle shoppers. Are you targeting all vehicle categories that your dealerships sell, or focusing on specific segments like sedans, SUVs, trucks? And do you have any demographic or behavioral signals that help identify the highest-quality in-market prospects beyond just "browsing Autotrader and Cars.com"?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Got it. You have the core data signals but system fragmentation creates gaps. We can work with what's available and flag data unification as a key optimization opportunity.

Now let's look at your $4.5M total budget allocation:

**Conquest**: $1.58M for 70% reach of competitor owners
**In-Market**: $2.03M for 10,000 qualified leads ($203 per lead)  
**Loyalty**: $900K for retention actions across 45,000 customers

These allocations seem strategically sound - heaviest investment in lead generation for immediate pipeline, meaningful conquest spend for future consideration, focused loyalty investment for high-value existing customers.

One key question: Is this $4.5M annual budget, and are you looking to distribute it evenly across 12 months, or do you have seasonal patterns in automotive that would affect pacing? For example, stronger spending in spring/summer or around model year transitions?

Turn 9:
Perfect seasonal logic. Your Q2/Q3 front-loading (65% of budget) aligns with automotive buying patterns and gives conquest awareness time to build consideration before peak shopping.

Let me model the quarterly distribution:
- **Q1**: $675K (15%) - Foundation building
- **Q2**: $1.35M (30%) - Peak awareness and lead gen ramp
- **Q3**: $1.58M (35%) - Maximum investment during strongest sales period  
- **Q4**: $900K (20%) - Sustained presence, holiday opportunities

Now for your value proposition by segment. For Conquest (awareness), what key differentiators do you want competitor owners to remember about your dealership group? Is it pricing, inventory selection, service experience, or something else that sets Velocity Auto Group apart from other dealers selling the same brands?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Excellent positioning. "Multi-brand choice with deep inventory and service network convenience" is differentiated and credible. That cross-brand consultation angle is particularly smart - it positions you as advisors rather than just another dealer.

For In-Market (lead generation), what value proposition drives the highest-quality leads? When active shoppers are comparing dealers, what messaging typically gets them to submit a form or call rather than just browse? Is it inventory availability, pricing transparency, financing options, or something else?

Turn 11:
Perfect. "Transparent pricing, immediate availability, and friction-free experience" addresses the core pain points that drive in-market shoppers to action. The financing pre-approval angle is smart psychology - removes the biggest uncertainty upfront.

For Loyalty (retention), what messaging resonates with your existing customers? Is it convenience, relationship continuity, exclusive offers, or something else that motivates them to choose you over independent service shops or other dealers for their ongoing needs?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 12:
Excellent. "We know you and your vehicle" with multi-location convenience and exclusive access creates real switching costs. That relationship continuity is your strongest retention moat.

Now let's move to channels. Given your three distinct objectives and audiences:

**Conquest** needs mass reach for competitor owners (likely TV, digital video, OOH)
**In-Market** needs performance channels where active shoppers research (SEM, automotive sites, social)
**Loyalty** needs direct channels leveraging your database (email, direct mail, targeted digital)

Starting with Conquest ($1.58M for 70% reach): What channels are you currently using or considering for awareness? Are you open to traditional media like TV and radio, or focusing primarily on digital channels?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 13:
Smart channel mix. 60% digital ($950K) gives you targeting precision for competitor owners, while 40% traditional ($630K) delivers the mass reach needed for 70% market penetration.

Modeling your conquest allocation:
- **CTV + YouTube**: ~$570K (premium video for brand building)
- **Display + programmatic**: ~$380K (reach extension and retargeting)
- **TV**: ~$450K (mass reach, especially older demographics)
- **Radio**: ~$180K (frequency building and commuter reach)

For In-Market ($2.03M targeting 10,000 leads at $203 each): Given your "transparent pricing and immediate availability" messaging, which performance channels typically deliver your highest-quality leads? Search, social, automotive sites, or other channels?

Turn 14:
Perfect channel allocation based on your quality vs volume needs.

Modeling your in-market allocation:
- **Search (Google Ads)**: $1.02M (50%) - projects ~5,100 leads at $200 CPL
- **Automotive sites**: $610K (30%) - projects ~2,200 leads at $275 CPL  
- **Social retargeting**: $406K (20%) - projects ~2,700 leads at $150 CPL (lower due to warm audience)

Total projection: ~10,000 leads hitting your $203 blended target.

For Loyalty ($900K targeting retention actions from 45,000 customers): Given your "we know you and your vehicle" positioning, which channels work best for reaching existing customers? Email, direct mail, targeted digital ads, or other approaches?
