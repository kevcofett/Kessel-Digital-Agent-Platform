# Media Plan Output: Basic User - Steps 1-2 Completion

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve? For example, are you looking to get more first-time customers, increase sales from existing customers, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Getting more first-time customers is a clear objective. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success.

What number would tell you this campaign worked? For example, would success be getting 1,000 new customers, or reaching $50,000 in sales from new buyers, or something else?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent! 500 new first-time customers is a solid target. Now I need one more piece to start modeling your plan.

What budget are you working with to bring in these 500 new customers?

Turn 4:
Great! Let me run the numbers on your plan:

$250,000 ÷ 500 customers = $500 per customer

This means you can spend up to $500 to acquire each new customer. That's quite generous for most shoe businesses and gives us excellent flexibility to reach quality customers through multiple channels.

To make sure this works financially, how much does a typical first-time customer spend on their initial purchase?
