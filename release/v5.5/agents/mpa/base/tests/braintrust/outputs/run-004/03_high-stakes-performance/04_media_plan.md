# Media Plan Output: High-Stakes Performance Campaign

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your business outcome. You mentioned acquiring 50,000 new merchants - is merchant acquisition your primary objective, or are you also looking to achieve specific revenue targets or transaction volume goals alongside this?

Turn 2:
Perfect - that's a clear dual objective. Your primary KPI is 50,000 new merchants, with $42.5M in new ARR as the revenue validation. The math checks out: 50,000 × $850 = $42.5M.

Now let's assess if your efficiency target is realistic. With your $2M budget targeting 50,000 merchants, that implies:

$2,000,000 ÷ 50,000 = $40 per merchant acquisition

At $850 LTV, that projects to a 21.25x LTV/CAC ratio, which is extremely aggressive for B2B acquisition. Typical fintech merchant acquisition costs range from $150-400 based on industry benchmarks.

This suggests we'll need exceptional targeting precision and channel efficiency. Is this $40 CAC based on proven performance, or should we model a more conservative scenario to ensure plan viability?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Appreciate the transparency - that's much more realistic. Let's model at a healthier efficiency:

**Conservative scenario (4:1 LTV/CAC):**
$850 ÷ 4 = $212.50 CAC
$2M ÷ $212.50 = 9,412 merchants

**Moderate scenario (5:1 LTV/CAC):**
$850 ÷ 5 = $170 CAC  
$2M ÷ $170 = 11,765 merchants

Your historical $250 CAC puts you at 3.4x LTV/CAC, so targeting 4-5x is ambitious but achievable with optimization.

The 50,000 merchant target would require either 5x budget increase or breakthrough efficiency gains. We could model a hybrid approach - perhaps targeting 12,000 merchants at sustainable efficiency, then scaling budget if performance exceeds expectations.

Which feels more realistic for planning purposes - the 9,400-11,800 range at healthy ratios, or should we explore what it would take to hit closer to 25,000 merchants?

Turn 4:
Excellent approach - that's smart growth strategy. Let's model a phased plan with built-in optionality:

**Phase 1 Foundation (Months 1-6):**
$1M budget targeting 12,000 merchants at $83 CAC
This gives us 10.2x LTV/CAC ratio - very healthy for proving efficiency

**Phase 2 Scale Option (Months 7-12):**
If Phase 1 hits targets, deploy remaining $1M for additional 12,000 merchants
Total: 24,000 merchants at blended $83 CAC

**Breakthrough Scenario:**
If we achieve sub-$70 CAC in Phase 1, we could hit your 25,000+ target within budget

This structure gives the board confidence in unit economics while preserving aggressive growth potential. You'll have concrete performance data before major budget deployment.

Now let's define your target merchant profile to ensure we're acquiring the right customers at these efficiencies. What type of merchants generate that $850 LTV - is it based on transaction volume, subscription fees, or a combination?

Turn 5:
Perfect - that transaction-based model with growing SMBs is solid. Service businesses with consistent monthly volume are ideal for sustainable LTV.

Let me check if your $850 LTV assumption holds up. For merchants processing $10K-$100K monthly (let's say $55K average), at a typical 2-3% take rate, that projects to:

$55K × 2.5% = $1,375 monthly revenue per merchant
$1,375 × 12 months = $16,500 annual revenue

That's significantly higher than your $850 LTV assumption. Are you factoring in churn, lower actual processing volumes, or a different take rate structure?

Understanding the true LTV is crucial because if it's actually higher, your efficiency targets become much more achievable. What am I missing in this calculation?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Excellent - this changes everything for the better. Let's recalculate with realistic LTV:

If we model conservatively at $12,000 annual LTV (factoring some churn and lower-volume merchants):

**Revised efficiency scenarios:**
- At 4:1 LTV/CAC: $12,000 ÷ 4 = $300 CAC
- At 5:1 LTV/CAC: $12,000 ÷ 5 = $240 CAC  
- At 6:1 LTV/CAC: $12,000 ÷ 6 = $200 CAC

**Your $2M budget now projects to:**
- $2M ÷ $300 = 6,667 merchants (4:1 ratio)
- $2M ÷ $240 = 8,333 merchants (5:1 ratio)
- $2M ÷ $200 = 10,000 merchants (6:1 ratio)

Even at your historical $250 CAC, you'd achieve a healthy 48:1 LTV/CAC ratio with $12K LTV.

This gives us much more realistic foundation planning. To bridge toward your 25,000 merchant goal, we'd need either expanded budget or breakthrough efficiency gains.

Should we proceed with the $12,000 LTV assumption, or do you want to model an even higher scenario given your transaction volume data?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Perfect - $12K LTV gives us strong unit economics foundation. That completes our economics framework with realistic efficiency targets.

Now let's define your target audience precisely. You mentioned contractors, consultants, and professional services processing $10K-$100K monthly. 

To build effective targeting, I need to understand the key signals that identify your highest-value prospects. What specific characteristics separate the merchants who hit that $55K monthly processing average from those who process much less? 

For example, is it business age, employee count, specific service types, or certain behavioral indicators that predict higher transaction volume?

Turn 8:
Excellent targeting criteria - that's a well-defined, addressable segment. Let me capture the key signals:

**Firmographic:** 3-7 years old, 5-25 employees, $10K-$100K monthly processing
**Vertical:** IT consulting, marketing agencies, electrical/HVAC contractors  
**Decision-maker:** Owner/Principal/Managing Partner titles
**Behavioral:** Month-over-month growth, established client base

This profile suggests businesses past startup phase but pre-enterprise - perfect for your positioning.

One critical question for channel planning: Are these prospects actively seeking payment solutions, or do we need to create demand? 

In other words, are they searching for "payment processing for contractors" or do we need to interrupt them with messaging about why they should switch from their current solution?
