# Media Plan Output: Full 10-Step Media Planning

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your efficiency target. $750K ÷ 15,000 = $50 per customer acquisition. That's aggressive but achievable for home decor if we target precisely.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 15,000 new customers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect! Growing market share and building a repeat customer base is a solid foundation. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success.

Your $50 per customer target is tight for home decor, so let's make sure the math works. What's the average order value for a new customer, and do they typically make repeat purchases within the first year?

This will help me assess if your $50 acquisition cost leaves room for profit.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Great data! Let me model your customer economics:

**Initial Purchase:** $250 AOV
**Repeat Rate:** 30% make second purchase
**Estimated LTV:** $250 + (30% × $250) = $325 per customer

At $50 acquisition cost, that projects to a 6.5x LTV/CAC ratio ($325 ÷ $50), which is excellent for ecommerce. This assumes similar order values on repeat purchases.

Your target efficiency is achievable with this unit economics foundation. The challenge will be reaching the right home decor buyers at scale within that $50 cost.

Step 1 complete! Now for Step 2 - do you have a target profit margin on that $250 AOV, or should I model using typical home decor benchmarks?

Turn 4:
Excellent! Your 35% margin gives us solid economics to work with:

**Your Numbers:**
- Gross profit per customer: $87.50 initial + (30% × $87.50) = $113.75
- At $50 CAC, that's $63.75 profit per customer after acquisition costs
- 2.3x gross profit to CAC ratio, which is healthy

**Home Decor Benchmarks:** Based on industry data, home decor typically sees 30-45% gross margins, so you're in the conservative range with room to improve. Your repeat rate of 30% is solid - market average is 20-35%.

Your economics are sound for the $50 efficiency target. The key will be precise audience targeting to hit that cost per customer.

Step 2 complete! Moving to Step 3 - who is your ideal customer? Think demographics, lifestyle, shopping behaviors that define your best home decor buyers.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Perfect foundation! Let me dig deeper into the behavioral signals that will help us find these customers efficiently.

Beyond the demographics, what specific lifestyle indicators help identify your best buyers? For example:

- Recent life events (new home, renovation, marriage)?
- Shopping behaviors (follows home decor influencers, shops competitor brands)?
- Interest signals (subscribes to design magazines, watches home improvement shows)?

These behavioral markers often perform better than demographics alone for reaching the right home decor shoppers at your $50 efficiency target.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 6:
Excellent behavioral insights! Those are high-converting signals for home decor:

**Key Audience Signals:**
- Recent movers (strong purchase intent)
- Design content consumers (Pinterest, Instagram, HGTV)
- Price-conscious but quality-focused buyers
- Statement piece seekers vs. full room makeovers

This gives us precise targeting beyond basic demographics. Recent movers especially have immediate need and higher conversion rates.

One more audience question: Do you see differences in product preferences or purchase behavior between urban apartment dwellers versus suburban homeowners? This could affect our targeting and creative approach.

Turn 7:
Brilliant insights! This urban vs. suburban split creates distinct targeting opportunities:

**Urban Segment:** Compact/multifunctional focus, frequent purchases, eclectic style
**Suburban Segment:** Larger pieces, coordinated designs, higher AOV

This suggests we may want different efficiency targets by segment. If suburban customers have higher AOV but urban customers purchase more frequently, we might allocate budget differently between these audiences.

Step 3 complete! Moving to Step 4 - what geographic markets are you prioritizing? Are you focused on specific metro areas, regions, or going nationwide with these segments?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
Perfect geographic focus! Major metros like NYC, SF, and Chicago align well with your audience profile and typically have higher home decor purchase intent.

**Geographic Strategy:**
- Primary: Major metro areas (NYC, SF, Chicago + suburbs)
- Secondary: Nationwide expansion from proven markets
- Audience concentration matches disposable income patterns

This geographic targeting should help achieve your $50 efficiency target since these markets have dense concentrations of your ideal customers.

Step 4 complete! Moving to Step 5 - with your $750K total budget, how would you like to allocate between your urban apartment and suburban homeowner segments? Should we weight toward the higher AOV suburban customers or the more frequent urban purchasers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 9:
Smart allocation strategy! The suburban segment's higher AOV should deliver stronger immediate returns:

**Budget Allocation:**
- Suburban: 60% = $450,000 (targeting 9,000 customers at $50 CAC)
- Urban: 40% = $300,000 (targeting 6,000 customers at $50 CAC)

This weighting toward suburban homeowners leverages their coordinated design preferences and larger purchases while maintaining urban presence for frequency and brand building.

Given suburban customers' preference for coordinated room designs versus urban customers' eclectic mix-and-match approach, your messaging will need to speak differently to each segment.

Step 5 complete! Moving to Step 6 - what's your core value proposition? How do you position HomeStyle Decor against competitors in the "modern, affordable home furnishings" space?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 10:
Excellent positioning! "Modern design accessible" is a strong differentiator that speaks directly to both segments:

**Value Proposition Strengths:**
- Design-forward quality without luxury pricing
- Personal aesthetic expression (appeals to urban eclectic buyers)
- Accessible modern style (resonates with suburban coordinated design needs)
- Quality balance between high-end and mass-produced

This messaging foundation works for both your urban mix-and-match customers and suburban coordinated design buyers, just with different creative executions.

Step 6 complete! Now for Step 7 - based on your audience behaviors (Pinterest browsing, Instagram following, design content consumption), which channels do you think would be most effective for reaching your home decor shoppers at that $50 efficiency target?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 10: Risks

Turn 11:
Perfect channel instincts! Instagram and Pinterest are ideal for home decor with strong visual discovery behaviors.

**Channel Recommendation:**
- **Pinterest (35% - $262,500):** Captures active design research intent, typically delivers $30-45 CAC for home decor
- **Instagram (30% - $225,000):** Visual showcase + influencer partnerships, usually $40-60 CAC range  
- **Meta Display (20% - $150,000):** Retargeting and lookalike expansion
- **Google Display/YouTube (15% - $112,500):** Design content placements and video showcases

This mix leverages high-intent design research (Pinterest) while building brand presence (Instagram) and expanding reach through display. All channels align with your audience's content consumption patterns.

The challenge will be creative differentiation - your "accessible modern design" message needs to stand out in crowded home decor feeds.

How does this channel allocation feel for hitting your 15,000 customer target?
