# Media Plan Output: Mass National Campaign - Simplicity Test

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

For your national snack launch, I need to understand the specific business outcome you're targeting. Brand awareness is the strategy, but what's the underlying business goal? Are you looking to drive trial purchases, increase market share in the snack category, or establish FreshBite as a recognized brand name before rolling out additional products?

Turn 2:
Perfect, establishing brand credibility and driving consideration for trial is a solid foundation. Now I need to define how we'll measure that success with specific numbers.

You mentioned brand lift studies, which is smart for awareness campaigns. What's your target for brand awareness lift? For example, are you aiming for 10-point lift in aided awareness, 15-point lift in consideration, or do you have specific benchmarks from competitive analysis or past launches?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it. A 10-point aided awareness lift and 12-15% consideration increase are solid targets for a first national launch. I'll model using these benchmarks - you can refine anytime as you get more data from your research team.

Now for the critical question: with your $8M budget targeting the broad adult snack market nationally, what volume of people do you need to reach to achieve those awareness lifts? Are you thinking total reach of 50 million adults, 100 million, or do you have a specific reach target in mind?

Turn 4:
Perfect. Let me run the math on your efficiency targets:

$8M budget / 75-80M reach = approximately $0.10-$0.11 cost per person reached

That's an achievable efficiency for national brand awareness campaigns. Based on typical media benchmarks, this suggests a solid foundation for meaningful frequency across your target audience.

Now I need to assess if this efficiency aligns with realistic awareness lift expectations. For a 10-point aided awareness lift across 75M adults, you'll typically need 3-5 frequency touches per person. Does your $8M budget assume any specific media mix, or are we building the channel strategy from scratch to hit these reach and frequency goals?

Turn 5:
Great - I'll note your channel preferences for when we build the media mix in Step 7. First, let's make sure we have the right foundation.

Your math works well: $8M for 75-80M reach at 3-5 frequency projects to strong awareness potential. This is an ambitious but realistic efficiency for national brand launch.

Before we move to audience definition, I need one final economics check. Do you have any expectation for how awareness translates to business impact? For example, if you achieve that 10-point awareness lift, are you expecting a certain percentage of aware consumers to try the product, or specific sales velocity in retail locations?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Perfect. I'll model using 3-5% trial conversion from aware consumers - that's reasonable for new snack launches. At 75M reach with 10-point awareness lift, that projects to 7.5M aware consumers, suggesting 225K-375K trial purchases. You can refine as retail data comes in.

Your economics foundation is solid. Now let's move to Step 3 - defining your target audience.

You mentioned adults 18-54 who buy snacks, which is broad but workable for a national launch. To optimize your $8M efficiently, I need to understand: are there any behavioral signals that define your ideal customer beyond age? For example, do they shop at premium grocery stores, buy organic/natural snacks, or have specific lifestyle interests that would help us target more precisely?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Excellent. Health-conscious, convenience-driven consumers with premium grocery shopping habits gives us much tighter targeting than basic demographics.

Your audience profile suggests people who value quality ingredients, shop at Whole Foods/Trader Joe's, and fit the active professional/young family lifestyle. This is a more affluent, educated segment within the 18-54 range.

One key question for targeting precision: within that health-conscious segment, are you prioritizing reach across the entire group, or would you rather focus more heavily on the core premium snack buyers - even if that means slightly less total reach but higher engagement from people most likely to pay premium prices for better ingredients?

Turn 8:
Perfect. Focusing on core premium snack buyers is smart - quality engagement over pure volume. That tightens your effective audience to maybe 30-35% of the total 18-54 population, so roughly 25-30 million adults nationally who match that premium, health-conscious profile.

This actually improves your efficiency: $8M / 25-30M targeted adults = $0.27-$0.32 cost per person, allowing for much stronger frequency against your ideal customers.

Now for Step 4 - Geography. You mentioned national launch, but within that scope, are there specific regions or DMAs where premium snack consumption is higher that we should weight more heavily? Markets like San Francisco, Seattle, Austin, or Northeast metros where health-conscious shopping is more prevalent?

Turn 9:
Excellent strategic thinking. Weighting 40-50% of budget toward premium health-conscious metros will maximize efficiency against your core audience.

Let me model this: $3.2-4M in key metros (SF, Seattle, Austin, Boston, NYC) targeting maybe 8-10M premium consumers, with remaining $4-4.8M spread nationally across 15-20M secondary targets. That creates strong frequency in your sweet spot markets while maintaining national presence.

Moving to Step 5 - Budget allocation. Based on your geographic priorities, I'd recommend 45% to tier-1 health metros ($3.6M), 35% to tier-2 markets with moderate health-conscious populations ($2.8M), and 20% to broad national fill ($1.6M).

Does that allocation feel right, or would you adjust the metro concentration higher or lower?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Perfect. The 45-35-20 geographic split gives you strategic depth in premium markets while maintaining national presence - exactly right for a brand launch.

Now for Step 6 - Value Proposition. You've mentioned premium positioning with better ingredients and interesting flavors, targeting health-conscious but convenience-driven consumers. 

For your awareness campaign messaging, what's the single most important thing you want consumers to remember about FreshBite? Is it the ingredient quality story, the flavor innovation, the convenience factor, or something else that differentiates you from both traditional snacks and other premium options?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 11:
That's a compelling value proposition - "no compromise snacking" that's both indulgent and genuinely good for you. The emotional hook of feeling good and excited about snacking differentiates you from both guilt-inducing traditional snacks and often bland healthy options.

Your messaging foundation is solid: premium quality meets genuine taste satisfaction for health-conscious consumers who refuse to compromise.

Now for Step 7 - Channels. Based on your $8M budget, 25-30M premium target audience, geographic concentration in health-conscious metros, and need for 3-5 frequency touches for awareness lift, which channels do you think will most efficiently reach your Whole Foods shopping, ingredient-conscious professionals? You mentioned TV, CTV, YouTube, and display earlier.

Turn 12:
Smart channel thinking. CTV and YouTube are perfect for your premium audience - they over-index with health-conscious professionals and support the rich storytelling your brand positioning needs.

Based on your targeting and frequency goals, I'd recommend: 50% CTV ($4M) for premium reach in key metros, 25% YouTube ($2M) for engaged video consumption, 15% traditional TV ($1.2M) for broad national presence, and 10% display ($800K) for retargeting and frequency extension.

This mix projects to approximately 25-28M reach at 4-5 frequency, hitting your awareness lift targets while concentrating spend on video platforms that can showcase ingredient quality and brand story effectively.

Does that channel allocation align with your strategic priorities, or would you shift more budget between CTV and YouTube?
