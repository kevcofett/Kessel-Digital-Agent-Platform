# Media Plan Output: Aggressive KPI - Must Narrow to Achieve

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect - you've given me strong data to start with. Let me run the math on your targets:

$750K ÷ 5,000 customers = $150 CAC exactly
At $2,400 LTV, that's a 16x LTV/CAC ratio - extremely healthy

Your efficiency target is aggressive but achievable for B2B SaaS. Based on KB benchmarks, $150 CAC for $2,400 LTV customers is tight but realistic with precise targeting to your SMB logistics segment.

Your business outcome is clear: acquire 5,000 new B2B SaaS customers. For your primary success KPI, are you measuring new customer acquisitions, or do you have a specific revenue target from these acquisitions?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect, 5,000 net new customers is your primary KPI with $150 CAC target. That $12-15M ARR projection confirms strong unit economics at your target efficiency.

Your economics look solid - $150 CAC against $2,400 LTV gives you a healthy 16x ratio. Based on B2B SaaS benchmarks, this efficiency is achievable but requires precise targeting to your SMB logistics segment. The tight CAC means we'll need disciplined audience definition and channel selection.

Step 1 complete. Now let's validate your economics are realistic. You mentioned average contract value - what's your typical ACV, and do you have data on customer payback period or contribution margin? This helps confirm the $150 CAC target holds up under real cash flow constraints.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Excellent - your economics validate the aggressive target:

$2,800 ACV with 13-month contracts = $2,154 annual value
68% contribution margin = $1,465 contribution per customer
9-10 month payback at $150 CAC confirms strong cash flow dynamics

Your $150 CAC target is aggressive but defensible. B2B SaaS at this ACV typically sees $200-300 CACs, so you're targeting the efficient end. With 68% margin and quick payback, you have buffer for optimization.

Step 2 complete - your unit economics support the efficiency target.

Now let's define your audience precisely. You mentioned SMB logistics managers at companies with 50-500 employees and $5M-$50M revenue, currently using spreadsheets or legacy TMS. 

What additional signals help identify these prospects? For example, do they typically have certain job titles, belong to specific industries beyond logistics, or show particular behavioral patterns when researching solutions?

Turn 4:
Perfect audience definition. Let me capture your key targeting signals:

**Job Titles:** Operations Manager, Logistics Coordinator, VP of Supply Chain, Director of Transportation
**Industries:** Trucking, freight brokerage, last-mile delivery  
**Company Size:** 50-500 employees, $5M-$50M revenue
**Behavioral:** Active on G2/Capterra, downloading logistics tech whitepapers, consuming operational efficiency content
**Psychographic:** Tech-curious pragmatists, seeking modernization without disruption

This gives us strong targeting precision for your aggressive $150 CAC target. The behavioral signals around G2/Capterra and whitepaper consumption are particularly valuable for intent-based targeting.

Step 3 complete - we have a well-defined audience profile.

Now for geography. Are you targeting the entire US market, or do you want to focus on specific regions or metro areas where SMB logistics companies are concentrated?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Smart geographic focus. Tier 1 logistics hubs give you:

**Primary Markets:** Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, LA, I-95 corridor (NYC/NJ/Philly)
**Strategic Logic:** Dense SMB logistics ecosystems, concentrated target companies
**Efficiency Benefit:** Concentrated spend improves frequency and share of voice vs. national spread

This geographic discipline supports your aggressive $150 CAC target. Focusing $750K in these high-density markets should generate better cost efficiency than broad national targeting.

Step 4 complete - we have precise geographic targeting.

Now let's validate your budget allocation. You have $750K total targeting 5,000 customers. How do you want to think about budget distribution - are you planning to weight certain markets more heavily, or do you want to allocate proportionally based on market size and opportunity density?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 6:
Excellent allocation strategy. Let me map your budget distribution:

**Atlanta:** 20% = $150K (targeting ~1,000 customers)
**I-95 Corridor:** 25% = $187.5K (targeting ~1,250 customers)  
**Chicago:** 15% = $112.5K (targeting ~750 customers)
**Dallas:** 15% = $112.5K (targeting ~750 customers)
**LA:** 15% = $112.5K (targeting ~750 customers)
**Reserve:** 10% = $75K (optimization/testing buffer)

This gives you meaningful volume in each market while concentrating firepower where SMB logistics density is highest. The 10% reserve provides flexibility for doubling down on high-performing markets.

Step 5 complete - budget allocation aligns with market opportunity.

Now let's define your value proposition. For these tech-curious but pragmatic SMB logistics managers, what's your core message? What specific pain point does SwiftDeliver solve that resonates most with someone stuck on spreadsheets or legacy TMS systems?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 7:
Strong value proposition. Your messaging hits three critical pain points:

**Core Promise:** Eliminate operational complexity, give time back
**Tangible Benefit:** 40% reduction in dispatch time 
**Business Impact:** Reduce margin-killing operational errors
**Emotional Hook:** Peace of mind for overwhelmed teams
**Positioning:** Single intuitive platform vs. fragmented manual processes

This resonates perfectly with your pragmatic implementer audience - concrete efficiency gains without disruption. The "give time back" angle addresses the personal pain these managers feel daily.

Step 6 complete - value proposition aligns with audience psychographics.

Now for channels. Given your $150 CAC target, precise B2B audience, and geographic focus, we need channels that can efficiently reach SMB logistics managers with intent signals.

Based on your audience's behavior on G2/Capterra and whitepaper consumption, which channels do you think would be most effective for reaching these prospects?
