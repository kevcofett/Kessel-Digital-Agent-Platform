# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience Unified Media Plan

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build this comprehensive media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've provided excellent segment detail - that strategic thinking will serve us well. Let me start with the foundation.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 25,000 new enrollees? For example, are you focused on premium revenue growth, market share expansion in specific regions, or diversifying your member base across age demographics?

Turn 2:
Perfect - diversifying your risk pool while expanding market share is a smart strategic approach. That gives us clear direction.

Now I need to understand how you'll measure success. You mentioned 25,000 new enrollees as your volume target. What's your primary success metric - is it total enrollees, or are you tracking something like cost per enrollment, premium revenue per acquisition, or member lifetime value?

In other words, what number will leadership use to determine if this $3M investment delivered?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent. Let me run the math on your targets:

$3M / 25,000 = $120 per enrollment

Your budget perfectly aligns with your CAC target - that's solid planning. At $120 per enrollment, you're targeting efficient acquisition across all three segments.

Now I need to assess if $120 CAC is realistic for health insurance. Based on industry benchmarks, health insurance CAC typically ranges from $150-$400 depending on plan type and demographics. Your $120 target is aggressive but achievable with tight targeting and strong conversion rates.

One critical question: Do you have different value expectations across your three segments? For instance, do Young Professionals, Families, and Pre-Medicare enrollees generate different lifetime premium values that might justify different acquisition costs per segment?

Turn 5:
Perfect allocation strategy. Let me calculate the implications:

**Budget Allocation & Targets:**
- Pre-Medicare: $1.2M / 40% of 25K = 10,000 enrollees = $120 CAC
- Families: $1.05M / 35% of 25K = 8,750 enrollees = $120 CAC  
- Young Professionals: $750K / 25% of 25K = 6,250 enrollees = $120 CAC

Interesting - your weighted budget maintains the $120 CAC across all segments. Given the LTV differences we modeled, this suggests Pre-Medicare could potentially support higher acquisition costs if needed, giving you flexibility to optimize.

Your economics foundation is solid. Now let's define your audiences more precisely.

Starting with your Young Professionals segment - you mentioned ages 26-35, urban metros, gym members who prefer digital interactions. To build effective targeting, I need more behavioral depth. What specific lifestyle or professional characteristics define your ideal Young Professional enrollee beyond demographics?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using reasonable assumptions based on typical health insurance patterns and you can refine as your analytics develop.

For modeling purposes, I'll assume:
- Pre-Medicare: ~$180 monthly premium ($2,160 annual LTV)
- Families: ~$150 monthly premium ($1,800 annual LTV) 
- Young Professionals: ~$120 monthly premium ($1,440 annual LTV)

At your $120 blended CAC target, this projects to healthy LTV/CAC ratios of 18x, 15x, and 12x respectively - all very strong for insurance.

However, this suggests we might want different CAC targets per segment. Pre-Medicare could justify higher acquisition costs given their premium value, while Young Professionals need tighter efficiency.

Should we allocate your $3M budget equally across segments (1M each for ~8,333 enrollees per segment), or would you prefer to weight it based on strategic priorities or expected conversion rates?

Turn 7:
Perfect - risk-averse parents prioritizing comprehensive pediatric coverage and network breadth over price. The "safety net" mindset is a powerful insight for messaging.

Now for your Pre-Medicare segment - ages 55-64, concentrated in FL, AZ, TX, focused on stability and network quality. What specific behaviors or concerns define your ideal Pre-Medicare enrollee? What's driving their health insurance decisions as they approach this major transition?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent - that psychographic depth gives us strong targeting signals. Tech workers, consultants, creatives with wellness-focused mindsets and digital integration preferences. The graduate education and platform activity (LinkedIn/Instagram) are particularly valuable for channel planning.

Now let's define your Family segment with the same precision. You mentioned ages 35-50, suburban markets, parents with kids under 18. Beyond demographics, what specific behaviors, concerns, or characteristics define your ideal Family enrollee? What drives their health insurance decisions?

Turn 8:
Excellent - security-focused professionals managing health transitions with emphasis on continuity of care and specialist access. The financial advisor consultation behavior is particularly valuable for targeting.

Now let's map your geographic priorities more precisely. You mentioned:
- Young Professionals: NYC, SF, LA, Chicago urban metros
- Families: Suburban markets around top 50 metros  
- Pre-Medicare: National but heavy FL, AZ, TX

For your Family segment, which specific metro suburban markets are highest priority? Are you targeting suburbs around the same metros as Young Professionals (NYC, SF, LA, Chicago) or different markets entirely?

Turn 9:
Perfect - suburban professional families in high-income school districts around major metros. Those specific markets like Naperville, Jersey suburbs, and Plano are excellent targeting anchors.

Your audience definition is now comprehensive across all three segments. You have strong geographic focus and clear behavioral profiles that will drive effective channel selection and messaging.

Let's confirm your budget allocation strategy. You proposed:
- Pre-Medicare: $1.2M (40%) targeting 10,000 enrollees  
- Families: $1.05M (35%) targeting 8,750 enrollees
- Young Professionals: $750K (25%) targeting 6,250 enrollees

This maintains your $120 CAC target across segments. Given the higher LTV we modeled for Pre-Medicare (~$2,160 annual), would you consider allowing higher CAC for that segment to potentially drive more volume, or do you want to maintain the $120 efficiency standard across all three?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 11:
Excellent positioning - "Health Insurance That Works as Hard as You Do" with integrated wellness platform differentiation. That resonates perfectly with their career-focused, wellness-oriented mindset.

Now for your Family segment - they're risk-averse parents prioritizing comprehensive pediatric coverage, network breadth, and that "safety net" feeling. What's TrueHealth's core value proposition that addresses their deep need for security and comprehensive protection for their children?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Smart approach - standardized CAC enables clean performance comparison and disciplined spending. That $120 efficiency standard across all segments gives you solid benchmarking data for future optimization.

Now let's develop your value propositions for each segment. These need to align with the distinct motivations we identified.

Starting with your Young Professionals - they see health insurance as part of their wellness strategy, want digital integration, telehealth, and mental health coverage. What's your core value proposition that differentiates TrueHealth for this tech-savvy, wellness-focused audience? What makes you their obvious choice over competitors?

Turn 12:
Perfect - "Protecting What Matters Most" with family health partner positioning directly addresses their safety net mindset and comprehensive coverage priorities.

Finally, for your Pre-Medicare segment - they're focused on transition security, continuity of care, specialist access, and guidance through this complex life stage. What's TrueHealth's value proposition that positions you as their trusted guide through this critical healthcare transition?
