# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience with Segment-Specific Channels

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build this sophisticated media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Your segment breakdown is excellent - you're clearly thinking strategically about distinct user journeys. Before we dive into channel-specific strategies, I need to establish your success framework.

$5M ÷ 50,000 = $100 per enrollment - that's your implied efficiency target.

What specific business outcome are you optimizing for beyond enrollments? Are you measuring revenue per cohort, completion rates, job placement success, or pure enrollment volume as your primary success metric?

Turn 2:
Perfect. You're evolving from volume to value optimization - that's smart strategic thinking. Let me model your current position and flag the key economic question we need to resolve.

**Current State Analysis:**
$5M ÷ 50,000 = $100 blended CAC across all segments

**The Critical Unknown:** Your three segments likely have dramatically different unit economics. Career Changers probably have higher course values and completion rates. College-Age may have lower immediate value but higher volume potential. Corporate L&D likely has highest LTV but longest sales cycles.

**What we need to establish:** Without segment-specific LTV data, I'll model using industry benchmarks for online education:
- Career Changers: ~$2,500 average course value, 75% completion
- College-Age: ~$1,200 average course value, 60% completion  
- Corporate L&D: ~$5,000+ contract value, 85% completion

This suggests your $100 blended CAC target is achievable, but we'll need different efficiency targets per segment.

Do you have any data on average course values or completion rates by segment type, or should I continue modeling with these industry assumptions?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Perfect targeting philosophy - precision with scale. That approach should generate strong performance in those tech hubs.

**Career Changer Targeting Summary:**
Tech/product/data professionals + intent signals + geo-focused = estimated 2-3M addressable audience across your 6 markets. Sufficient for meaningful volume.

**College-Age Precision Question:**

For the 18-24 segment, your "Gen Z exploring alternatives to traditional degrees" positioning is compelling. How precise should we get here? 

Are we targeting:
- Broad: All 18-24 with college-alternative interest signals
- Moderate: Current college students + recent graduates + gap year students  
- Precise: Students in specific majors (business, tech, creative) showing dissatisfaction with traditional path

This affects creative messaging and determines if we're competing against colleges or positioning as complementary education.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent. Based on these benchmarks, your segment economics look strong:

**Efficiency Analysis:**
- Career Changers: $2,500 value, 75% completion = $1,875 realized value
- College-Age: $1,200 value, 60% completion = $720 realized value  
- Corporate L&D: $5,000 value, 85% completion = $4,250 realized value

At $100 blended CAC, you're projecting healthy 7-18x LTV/CAC ratios across segments. Corporate L&D offers exceptional unit economics - we can likely invest $300-500 per acquisition there while College-Age needs tighter $50-75 efficiency.

**Moving to Audience Definition:**

You've outlined three distinct personas with different media consumption patterns. Now I need to understand audience precision requirements.

For your Career Changer segment (28-42, tech hubs), how specific do you want to get with targeting? Are we talking broad "professionals in tech markets" or precise targeting like "software engineers with 5+ years experience in specific companies"? 

The answer affects reach potential and determines whether we can hit your volume targets within segment.

Turn 6:
Perfect hybrid strategy. That precision targeting should deliver strong ROI given the $4,250 realized value per Corporate L&D enrollment.

**Corporate L&D Targeting Summary:**
L&D + HR decision makers at 250-5000 employee companies in tech/professional services/healthcare = estimated 150-200K addressable audience. Smaller pool but highest value, ideal for ABM approach.

**Geography Refinement:**

You've defined primary geos well for Career Changers (6 tech hubs) and broad national for College-Age. For Corporate L&D, you mentioned "corporate HQ cities" - should we focus on traditional business centers like NYC, Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, plus your existing tech hubs? 

Or do you want to start with a smaller test market approach given the longer B2B sales cycle and higher investment per acquisition?

The geography decision affects budget allocation across your three segments.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Excellent - moderate precision with creator influence focus. That audience definition should capture students actively questioning traditional paths while maintaining scale for your volume needs.

**College-Age Targeting Summary:**
Current students + recent grads + gap year (business/tech/creative focus) + creator influence signals = estimated 8-12M addressable nationally. Strong volume potential.

**Corporate L&D Precision Question:**

This is your highest-value segment at $4,250 realized value, so precision is critical. You mentioned "ABM approach" and "longer B2B sales cycle."

Should we target:
- Individual L&D professionals who influence decisions
- Account-based targeting of specific companies + their L&D teams
- Both individuals AND companies with different messaging

Also, what company size threshold? Mid-market (100-1000 employees) or enterprise (1000+), or both with different approaches?

The ABM component suggests we might need named account lists rather than broad demographic targeting.

Turn 8:
Excellent balanced approach. That allocation prioritizes your highest-value segment while maintaining volume diversification.

**Budget Allocation Analysis:**
$5M × 40% = $2M Corporate L&D (50K addressable) = $40 per person reach
$5M × 35% = $1.75M Career Changers (2.5M addressable) = $0.70 per person reach  
$5M × 25% = $1.25M College-Age (10M addressable) = $0.13 per person reach

**Projected Enrollments by Segment:**
- Corporate L&D: $2M ÷ $400 CAC = 5,000 enrollments
- Career Changers: $1.75M ÷ $125 CAC = 14,000 enrollments
- College-Age: $1.25M ÷ $40 CAC = 31,250 enrollments

Total: 50,250 enrollments (exceeds your 50K target)

**Value Proposition Alignment:**

Each segment needs distinct messaging. For Corporate L&D, what's your core value proposition - ROI/productivity gains, talent retention, competitive advantage through upskilling, or compliance/certification focus?

This determines whether we lead with business outcomes or learning outcomes in our ABM messaging.

Turn 9:
Perfect positioning - talent transformation as competitive advantage resonates strongly with forward-thinking L&D leaders.

**Corporate L&D Value Proposition:**
"Strategic workforce transformation" messaging emphasizes future-readiness and competitive differentiation. This positions EduPath as a strategic partner, not just a training vendor - critical for justifying premium pricing and longer sales cycles.

**Channel Strategy Time:**

Now we can build channel recommendations specific to each segment's media consumption and your value propositions.

Starting with Corporate L&D since it's your highest investment: Given your ABM approach, $2M budget, and "strategic talent transformation" positioning, I'm seeing LinkedIn as your primary channel with supporting trade publication placements.

Should we structure this as pure LinkedIn ABM targeting your named accounts and personas, or do you want a multi-touch approach that includes industry publications, event sponsorships, or other B2B channels to build credibility before the LinkedIn direct outreach?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Excellent strategic approach. Test-and-expand with surgical precision in high-density markets will generate cleaner performance data for your ABM model.

**Complete Audience & Geography Framework:**
- Career Changers: 6 tech hubs, 2-3M addressable
- College-Age: National, 8-12M addressable  
- Corporate L&D: 5 business centers pilot, ~50K addressable in test markets

**Budget Allocation Question:**

Given your dramatically different segment economics and audience sizes, how do you want to weight your $5M investment?

The math suggests several approaches:
- Value-weighted: Heavy Corporate L&D investment ($300-500 CAC viable)
- Volume-weighted: Heavy College-Age for enrollment numbers
- Balanced: Equal investment with different efficiency targets per segment

What's your strategic priority - proving the highest-value Corporate L&D model first, maximizing total enrollments, or building a diversified portfolio across all three?

Turn 11:
Perfect refinement. Higher LinkedIn allocation leverages their superior professional intent signals.

**Career Changer Channel Mix ($1.75M):**
- LinkedIn (70% = $1.225M): Professional targeting with career transition signals
- Podcast Sponsorships (20% = $350K): "Masters of Scale" + tech industry shows
- Search Ads (10% = $175K): Bottom-funnel career change intent capture

**College-Age Channel Strategy ($1.25M):**

For Gen Z exploring college alternatives, you mentioned TikTok/Instagram with creator influence focus. Given their mobile-first behavior and creator trust patterns, I'm seeing influencer partnerships as primary with social platform advertising as support.

Should we structure this as 50% micro-influencer partnerships (career development creators), 40% TikTok/Instagram ads, and 10% Snapchat for broader Gen Z reach? Or do you want heavier emphasis on organic creator content versus paid social advertising?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Brilliant multi-touch strategy. Building credibility before direct outreach dramatically improves ABM conversion rates.

**Corporate L&D Channel Mix ($2M):**
- Content/Publications (30% = $600K): Training Magazine, HR Executive, LinkedIn thought leadership
- LinkedIn ABM (50% = $1M): Direct targeting of named accounts and personas
- Conference Sponsorships (20% = $400K): Strategic HR/L&D events

This creates a sophisticated nurture funnel: awareness through publications → credibility through conferences → direct engagement through ABM.

**Career Changer Channel Strategy ($1.75M):**

For tech professionals showing career transition intent, I'm seeing LinkedIn as primary (they're heavy users) with podcast sponsorships for business/tech shows they consume during commutes.

Given your "precision with scale" approach, should we structure this as 60% LinkedIn professional targeting, 30% podcast sponsorships (business/career development shows), and 10% programmatic display retargeting? Or do you see other channels that better reach career-transition intent signals?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 12:
Excellent creator-first approach. Authentic transformation stories will resonate far better with Gen Z than traditional advertising.

**College-Age Channel Mix ($1.25M):**
- Micro-Influencer Partnerships (60% = $750K): Authentic career transformation creators
- TikTok/Instagram Ads (35% = $437.5K): Supporting paid social
- YouTube Educational Content (5% = $62.5K): Longer-form career guidance

**Complete Channel Strategy Summary:**

**Corporate L&D ($2M):** Publications → Conferences → LinkedIn ABM
**Career Changers ($1.75M):** LinkedIn professional targeting + podcasts + search
**College-Age ($1.25M):** Creator partnerships + social ads + YouTube

**Measurement Framework:**

Given your shift toward completion rates and job placement success, how do you want to measure success beyond enrollments? Should we track segment-specific metrics like:
- Corporate L&D: Contract value + completion rates
- Career Changers: Job placement within 6 months  
- College-Age: Program completion + career advancement

Or do you prefer unified metrics across all segments?
