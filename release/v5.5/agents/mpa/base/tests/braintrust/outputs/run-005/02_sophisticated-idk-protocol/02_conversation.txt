USER:
Hey, I'm the growth lead at QuickSend. We're a remittance fintech looking to acquire 10,000 new users this quarter with a $500K media spend. Let's build out the media strategy.

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect starting point - 10,000 new users with $500K gives us $500K ÷ 10,000 = $50 per user acquisition cost. That's tight but achievable for fintech.

Before we model this further, what's the primary business outcome you're targeting? Are you focused on user volume, transaction volume, or revenue growth from these 10,000 users?

TURN 2 (Step 3)

USER:
The primary outcome we're targeting is user volume - we need to hit that 10K new user milestone this quarter. But obviously we want quality users who will actually transact, not just sign-ups who never send money. I'd say it's probably 70% focused on hitting the volume target and 30% making sure we're acquiring users who will generate meaningful transaction volume down the line.

AGENT:
Got it - hitting 10K user volume is the primary objective with quality as a secondary filter. That's smart prioritization for a growth milestone.

For your primary KPI, how are you defining "new users"? Are you measuring completed registrations, verified accounts, or first transaction completed? This affects how we optimize and what we can realistically achieve at $50 per user.

TURN 3 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're measuring new users as completed registrations with verified accounts - so they've gone through our KYC process and can actually send money. We don't want to count people who just started the signup flow but never finished verification. I think measuring at first transaction would be too restrictive given our $50 acquisition cost, but we definitely need users who are ready to transact, not just tire-kickers who bounce after seeing our fees.

AGENT:
Perfect - verified accounts is the right KPI. It ensures quality while being realistic at your $50 target cost.

Now let's assess if $50 per verified user is achievable. What's the typical lifetime value of a QuickSend customer? Even a rough estimate helps - for example, average transaction size, frequency, and your take rate percentage. This determines if your $50 acquisition cost creates profitable unit economics.
