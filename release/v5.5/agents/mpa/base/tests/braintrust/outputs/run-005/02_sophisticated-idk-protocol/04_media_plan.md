# Media Plan Output: Sophisticated User - IDK Protocol

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect starting point - 10,000 new users with $500K gives us $500K ÷ 10,000 = $50 per user acquisition cost. That's tight but achievable for fintech.

Before we model this further, what's the primary business outcome you're targeting? Are you focused on user volume, transaction volume, or revenue growth from these 10,000 users?

Turn 3:
Perfect - verified accounts is the right KPI. It ensures quality while being realistic at your $50 target cost.

Now let's assess if $50 per verified user is achievable. What's the typical lifetime value of a QuickSend customer? Even a rough estimate helps - for example, average transaction size, frequency, and your take rate percentage. This determines if your $50 acquisition cost creates profitable unit economics.

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Got it - hitting 10K user volume is the primary objective with quality as a secondary filter. That's smart prioritization for a growth milestone.

For your primary KPI, how are you defining "new users"? Are you measuring completed registrations, verified accounts, or first transaction completed? This affects how we optimize and what we can realistically achieve at $50 per user.
