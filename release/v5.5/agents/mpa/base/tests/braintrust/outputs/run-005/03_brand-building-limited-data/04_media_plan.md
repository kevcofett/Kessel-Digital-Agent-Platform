# Media Plan Output: Brand Building with Limited Data

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start with your West Coast expansion. For your brand awareness objective, what specific business outcome are you trying to achieve? For example, are you aiming for a certain number of new customers, a revenue target, or market share goal in these three states?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Great, brand recognition driving customer acquisition makes sense for market entry. Let me clarify your success measurement. 

You mentioned 5,000 to 10,000 new customers as your main goal. Is customer count your primary way to measure success, or would you prefer to track brand awareness metrics like aided/unaided recall or consideration? 

Both are valid - I just want to make sure we're measuring what matters most to you for this launch.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Perfect! New customer acquisition is a solid, measurable goal. Let's use 7,500 new customers as your target - the midpoint of your 5,000 to 10,000 range.

$500K ÷ 7,500 customers = $67 per customer acquisition cost

That's your implied cost to acquire each new customer. For natural supplements and wellness products, this efficiency looks achievable based on typical industry performance.

To make sure this math works for your business, what does a typical customer spend with you? For example, is it usually one $40 purchase, or do customers come back and spend $150 over their first year?

Turn 5:
Excellent profile - health-conscious millennials and Gen Z who value quality and research purchases. That's a well-defined audience for the wellness space.

To size this audience in your West Coast markets, I need to understand a few more signals. You mentioned they shop at Whole Foods and are active on social media. 

What other behaviors or interests help identify your ideal customers? For example, do they follow fitness influencers, buy organic food regularly, use wellness apps, or have other specific lifestyle indicators we can target?

Turn 6:
Perfect! Those are strong targeting signals - organic food buyers, yoga/fitness activities, wellness influencers, health tracking apps, and ingredient-conscious shoppers. That builds a clear behavioral profile.

Now let's look at your West Coast geography. You mentioned California, Oregon, and Washington. 

Are you planning to focus on the major metro areas in these states, or do you want broader statewide coverage? For example, would you prioritize markets like Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and Portland, or include smaller cities too?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using $150 customer lifetime value based on your $60-80 first purchase and repeat business estimate. You can refine this anytime.

At $67 cost per customer with $150 lifetime value, that projects to a 2.2x return ratio ($150 ÷ $67). This is conservative but workable for wellness brands, especially in a new market where you're building awareness.

Your efficiency target looks realistic. The $67 per customer sits well within typical ranges for natural supplements, and your lifetime value provides healthy cushion for profitable growth.

Now that we've confirmed your economics work, let's move to Step 3. Who is your ideal customer for these wellness products?

Turn 7:
Absolutely - metro focus is smart for your budget and audience. LA, San Francisco, Seattle, and Portland are perfect markets for health-conscious millennials with strong organic/wellness cultures.

Your $500K budget concentrated across these four metros gives you meaningful presence in each market rather than spreading too thin. These cities also have the population density to efficiently reach your 7,500 customer target.

Now let's move to Step 5 - budget allocation. How would you like to split your $500K across these four metros? For example, should California get a larger share since LA and San Francisco are bigger markets, or do you want to test equally across all four cities first?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Your instinct is solid - California's population size does justify larger allocation. Let me refine your split based on metro populations and wellness market concentration:

**Recommended allocation:**
- Los Angeles: $200K (40%)
- San Francisco: $120K (24%) 
- Seattle: $120K (24%)
- Portland: $60K (12%)

This weights LA heavily as the largest metro, gives San Francisco and Seattle equal priority since both have strong wellness cultures and similar target audience density, and allocates Portland proportionally to its smaller size.

$200K in LA projects to ~3,000 customers, $120K each in SF and Seattle projects to ~1,800 customers each, and $60K in Portland projects to ~900 customers. That totals your 7,500 target.

Does this allocation feel right for your market entry strategy?

Turn 9:
Great decision! Your instinct about Portland's wellness culture is spot-on, but you're right that population size matters for efficient customer acquisition. We can always reallocate budget based on early performance data.

Now let's move to Step 6 - your value proposition. When your ideal customers in these metro markets are choosing between natural supplement brands, what makes GreenLeaf Wellness different or better? 

For example, is it your ingredient sourcing, product quality, specific health benefits, or something else that sets you apart from other wellness brands?
