# Media Plan Output: High-Stakes Performance Campaign

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by calculating your implied efficiency: $2M ÷ 50,000 = $40 per merchant acquisition. With $850 LTV, that's a strong 21x LTV/CAC ratio - very healthy for fintech.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 50,000 new merchants? For example, are you focused on overall platform growth, expanding into new market segments, or hitting a specific revenue milestone?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Your primary objective is clear: hit $42M ARR through scaled merchant acquisition with geographic diversification. That's $840 average annual revenue per new merchant, which aligns well with your $850 LTV.

For measuring success, I want to confirm your primary KPI. Since you're focused on ARR targets, would your main success metric be:

1. New merchants acquired (the 50,000 volume target), or 
2. ARR generated from new merchants (aiming for a specific portion of that $42M from new vs. existing merchant growth)?

This helps determine whether we optimize primarily for acquisition volume or revenue quality from new merchants.

Turn 4:
Perfect! Your conservative planning makes sense for new market expansion, and that upside potential is valuable optionality.

Now let's define your target merchant audience. Since you're expanding from major metros into secondary markets, I need to understand who converts best for PayStream.

What type of merchants perform best on your platform currently? For example, are you strongest with specific business categories (restaurants, retail, services), transaction patterns (high-frequency small amounts vs. larger periodic transactions), or business characteristics (revenue size, digital sophistication, payment processing needs)?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - $30M ARR from new merchants is your primary KPI, with 50,000 merchants as the volume pathway to get there. That's $600 average ARR per new merchant needed to hit your target.

I notice a gap: your current merchants average $840 ARR, but you need only $600 per new merchant to hit $30M. This suggests either:
- Conservative planning with upside potential, or 
- Expectation that new market merchants may have different value profiles

At $40 CAC with $600 ARR requirement, you're still at a healthy 15x first-year revenue multiple. 

Your economics look very achievable for fintech. Ready to move to defining your target merchant audience, or do you want to refine any of these financial assumptions first?

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Great profile! Small businesses processing $10K-100K monthly with moderate frequency, decent ticket sizes - that's a solid recurring revenue foundation.

To size this audience in your expansion markets, I need to understand the business characteristics that predict success. Beyond the transaction volume, what other signals help identify your best prospects?

For example, do you see patterns around:
- Business age or maturity stage
- Current payment processing setup (switching from legacy processors vs. first-time digital adoption)  
- Employee count or business size indicators
- Specific pain points that drive them to switch (better rates, easier integration, customer service issues with current provider)

These signals will help us identify and size your target audience in secondary markets.

Turn 6:
Excellent! That's a very targetable profile: established 2-5 year businesses, 5-25 employees, outgrowing basic solutions, seeking better rates and integrations.

One more audience dimension: Are there specific industries or business types within your service/retail sweet spot that convert exceptionally well? 

For instance, do you see higher conversion rates or LTV from certain verticals like home services contractors, professional consultants, or specialty retail? Or do specific business models perform better - subscription-based services, project-based businesses, or transaction-heavy retail?

This will help us prioritize which business types to focus on as we expand into secondary markets where we'll need to be selective about our targeting.

Turn 7:
Perfect! Home services contractors and professional services with recurring models - that's a highly focused, high-converting audience with strong LTV characteristics.

Your target audience is well-defined:
- Industries: Home services (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, landscaping) and professional services (agencies, accounting firms)
- Business profile: 2-5 years established, 5-25 employees, $10K-100K monthly processing
- Revenue model: Subscription/retainer-based preferred for LTV
- Pain points: Outgrowing basic processors, need better rates and integrations

Now let's define your geography. You mentioned expanding from major metros into secondary markets. Which major metros are you currently strongest in, and what secondary markets are you considering? This will help us size your audience and allocate your $2M budget across markets.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Excellent geographic strategy! Strong foundation markets plus growing secondary metros with lower competition - smart approach.

Let me calculate your proposed allocation: 60% to major metros = $1.2M, 40% to secondary markets = $800K.

For the secondary markets (Austin, Nashville, Denver, Phoenix, Tampa, Charlotte, Raleigh), that's roughly $115K per market if split evenly. 

Before we lock this in, I want to validate the math: Do you have data on merchant density or acquisition costs in these secondary markets versus your major metros? If secondary markets prove more efficient (lower CAC), you might want to weight the allocation more heavily toward expansion. Conversely, if they're harder to crack initially, starting with fewer markets but deeper investment might be smarter.

What's your instinct on relative efficiency between your proven metros and these new markets?

Turn 9:
Smart thinking! Concentrating on 4-5 markets with $160-200K each gives you meaningful presence to overcome the brand awareness challenge and build local momentum.

Austin, Denver, and Nashville sound like strong lead markets. For the other 1-2 slots, what's drawing you to the remaining options? Are Phoenix, Tampa, Charlotte, or Raleigh showing specific signals - like strong home services growth, business formation rates, or competitive gaps - that make them particularly attractive?

Also, within your major metros, are you planning to maintain current spend levels, or do you see opportunities to optimize efficiency in those proven markets to fund more aggressive expansion?

Turn 10:
Perfect! Austin, Denver, Nashville, Phoenix, and Charlotte as your expansion focus - that's roughly $160K per market with strong strategic rationale for each.

Your efficiency optimization in major metros is smart. If you achieve 10-15% gains on that $1.2M allocation, that's an additional $120-180K you could reallocate to expansion or hold as contingency.

Now let's move to your value proposition. You mentioned competitive rates, integration capabilities, and superior customer service as key differentiators. As you enter these secondary markets without established referral networks, which of these value props do you think will be most compelling for breaking through the noise and driving initial conversions?

Or do you see needing a different lead message for cold prospect acquisition versus your current referral-driven approach?
