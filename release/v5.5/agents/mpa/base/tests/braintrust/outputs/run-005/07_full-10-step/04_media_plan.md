# Media Plan Output: Full 10-Step Media Planning

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your business outcome. You mentioned acquiring 15,000 new customers - is customer acquisition your primary objective, or are you also focused on other outcomes like increasing revenue from existing customers or building brand awareness?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Customer acquisition as your primary objective is clear. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success.

$750K / 15,000 = $50 per customer acquisition cost. That's your implied efficiency target.

What's the main number you'll use to track if the campaign is working? For example, are you focused on the cost to acquire each customer, the revenue generated from ad spend, or something else?

Turn 4:
Great data! At $280 average order value with $50 CAC, that's a 5.6x return on ad spend ($280 / $50 = 5.6x). That's a healthy efficiency target for home decor.

To complete the economics picture, I need one more key number. What's your gross margin on that $280 average order? For example, after product costs and fulfillment, do you keep about 40%, 50%, or 60% of that revenue?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent! Cost per acquisition at $50 is your primary KPI, with order value quality as a secondary metric. That's smart given your product range variation.

Now I need to assess if that $50 CAC target is realistic for home decor and furniture. What's the average value of a first purchase for your new customers? For example, does a typical new customer spend $200, $400, or something else on their initial order?

Turn 5:
Perfect! Let me model your unit economics:

$280 average order × 35% margin = $98 gross profit per customer
$98 gross profit - $50 CAC = $48 contribution per acquisition

That's a solid 1.96x gross profit to CAC ratio ($98 / $50). For home decor with shipping challenges, this is actually quite healthy. Your $50 target is achievable but will require disciplined audience targeting and channel efficiency.

Now that we have realistic economics established, let's move to Step 3. Who is your ideal customer? Can you describe the type of person most likely to buy home decor and furniture from you?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Excellent customer profile! Homeowners aged 30-55, predominantly women, $60K+ household income, life stage transitions, and socially engaged. That gives us strong targeting signals.

Let me dig deeper on one key aspect. When you say "homeowners" - do you also see success with renters who are decorating apartments or rental homes, or is homeownership specifically important for your customer base?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Perfect! That's helpful context - homeowners for larger furniture purchases, renters for portable decor items, both valuable segments.

Now let's define geography. Are you selling nationwide, or do you focus on specific regions? And are there any areas where you see particularly strong performance or face shipping challenges?

Turn 8:
Excellent! Metro-focused with nationwide reach makes sense for your shipping economics. Major markets like LA, NYC, Chicago, Atlanta, and Dallas as your core, with 75% concentration in metro areas.

Now for Step 5 - budget allocation. You have $750K total with an 80/20 split between acquisition and retention. That gives us $600K for new customer acquisition and $150K for existing customer growth.

Should we allocate that $600K acquisition budget evenly across the year, or do you have seasonal patterns? For example, do you see stronger sales around holidays, moving seasons, or other times when people redecorate?

Turn 9:
Smart seasonal approach! Let me model that allocation:

Spring peak (March-May): 20% of $600K = $120K
Holiday peak (Oct-Dec): 20% of $600K = $120K  
Off-peak (Jan-Feb, Jun-Sep): 60% of $600K = $360K

That concentrates firepower during your strongest demand periods while maintaining year-round presence.

Now for Step 6 - your value proposition. What makes customers choose HomeStyle Decor over other online furniture retailers? Is it your product selection, pricing, customer service, or something else that sets you apart?

Turn 11:
Great foundation! Meta (Facebook/Instagram) at 60% and Google Search making up most of the remainder makes sense for your visual products and intent-based searches.

Given your success with Meta and the untapped potential of Pinterest for home decor inspiration, here's my recommended channel allocation for your $600K acquisition budget:

- Meta (Facebook/Instagram): 45% = $270K
- Google Search: 25% = $150K  
- Pinterest: 20% = $120K
- Google Shopping: 10% = $60K

This maintains your Meta strength while scaling Pinterest (huge for home decor discovery) and adding Shopping for product visibility. Does this allocation align with your growth priorities, or would you adjust any of these percentages?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Excellent positioning! Curated, on-trend pieces with strong design support and content inspiration. That "Instagram-worthy but accessible" value prop is powerful for your demographic.

Now for Step 7 - channels. Based on your audience (30-55, metro-focused, socially engaged, design-inspired) and your visual products, I'm thinking a mix that leverages both discovery and intent.

Given your customer profile and $600K acquisition budget, what channels are you currently using, and what's working best for you right now?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 12:
Excellent instinct! You're absolutely right - Pinterest is likely your biggest growth opportunity given the platform's dominance in home decor inspiration. Let me adjust:

- Meta (Facebook/Instagram): 45% = $270K
- Pinterest: 25% = $150K  
- Google Search: 20% = $120K
- Google Shopping: 10% = $60K

This gives Pinterest more room to scale while still maintaining strong search presence. Pinterest users are actively planning room makeovers and saving furniture ideas - perfect for your customer journey.

Now for Step 8 - measurement. Beyond your primary $50 CAC target, what other metrics will help you optimize? For example, are you tracking metrics like return on ad spend by channel, or customer lifetime value to assess long-term success?

Turn 14:
Perfect testing roadmap! Spring Pinterest scaling, lifestyle vs. product creative, broader Pinterest targeting, and video content - all smart tests for home decor.

I'd prioritize that spring Pinterest test first since it aligns with your peak season and biggest growth opportunity. Video content testing across Meta and Pinterest could be powerful given how well room transformations perform.

Finally, Step 10 - risks. What concerns you most about this plan? For example, are you worried about Pinterest's learning curve since it's new territory, seasonal budget concentration, or something else that could impact your $50 CAC target?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 13:
Excellent measurement approach! $450 LTV with $50 CAC gives you a healthy 9x LTV/CAC ratio - that's strong for sustainable growth.

Your instinct about different channel behaviors is spot-on. Meta/Pinterest users are often in discovery mode and may buy smaller initial orders but return more frequently, while Google searchers have higher intent and larger first purchases. Tracking AOV and repeat purchase rates by channel will be crucial for optimizing your mix.

Now for Step 9 - testing strategy. With four channels and seasonal peaks, what would you most want to test? For example, different creative approaches, new audience segments, or maybe testing Pinterest performance during your spring peak versus holiday season?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 15:
Those are smart, realistic concerns that show excellent strategic thinking.

For Pinterest risk mitigation, I'd recommend starting with 10-15% of that budget in January-February to build learning and optimization before spring peak. That way you're not learning during your highest-value period.

For seasonal concentration risk, consider keeping 15-20% budget in reserve that you can deploy if early performance exceeds targets or shift to off-peak if seasonal campaigns underperform.

For shipping cost protection, monitor your blended CAC by geography monthly. If rural/expensive shipping areas push CAC above $50, you can adjust targeting to prioritize metro areas where your unit economics are strongest.

You now have a complete media plan: $600K across four channels, seasonal allocation, measurement framework, testing roadmap, and risk mitigation. What feels like the most important next step to get this plan into action?

Turn 16:
Smart thinking! I'd definitely recommend a December foundation phase - maybe $5-10K to set up Pinterest properly without pressure. That gives you time to:

- Upload and optimize your product catalog
- Install conversion tracking and test data flow
- Create initial lifestyle creative assets
- Run small audience tests to understand what resonates

This way January starts with a functioning system rather than a scramble during your ramp-up period.

For geographic CAC tracking, make sure you can break down performance by major metro areas versus secondary markets. That early warning system will be crucial for maintaining your $50 target as you scale.

You've built a solid, realistic plan with smart risk management. Your combination of proven channels (Meta), high-potential growth (Pinterest), and intent capture (Google) should deliver those 15,000 customers efficiently. The key will be that disciplined Pinterest learning curve and staying alert to shipping economics as you scale.

Turn 17:
You're very welcome! It was great working through this with you. You brought excellent strategic thinking to the process - especially catching that Pinterest budget adjustment and identifying those shipping cost risks early. That kind of proactive planning is what separates good campaigns from great ones.

Your plan is solid and realistic: strong unit economics foundation, smart channel mix leveraging your visual products, proper seasonal allocation, and thoughtful risk mitigation. Most importantly, you understand the reasoning behind each decision, which will serve you well when you need to optimize and adapt.

Best of luck with the December Pinterest setup and your 2025 growth goals. You've got all the pieces in place to hit those 15,000 customers efficiently!
