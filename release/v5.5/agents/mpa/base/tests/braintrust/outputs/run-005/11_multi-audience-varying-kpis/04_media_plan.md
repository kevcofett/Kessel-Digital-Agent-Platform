# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience with Different KPIs Per Segment

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build this multi-segment media plan with you. You've outlined a sophisticated three-pronged approach that requires different strategies for each objective. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks.

Your setup is excellent - conquest awareness, in-market lead generation, and loyalty retention each need distinct approaches. Let me start with your most critical success metric.

For your In-Market segment (45% of budget, ~$2M), what's your target lead volume? Are you aiming for a specific number of qualified leads, VDP views, or test drive appointments per month?

Turn 2:
Perfect. Let's model your In-Market efficiency first since it's your largest investment.

$2M annually / 3,600-4,800 test drives = $417-556 per test drive
$2M annually / 9,600-12,000 qualified leads = $167-208 per lead

Based on automotive benchmarks, $400-500 per test drive is aggressive but achievable with tight audience targeting. Lead costs of $170-200 are realistic for in-market shoppers.

Now for your Conquest segment ($1.6M for awareness): What's your success definition there? Are you targeting a specific reach percentage of competitor vehicle owners, or measuring brand lift through surveys? This helps determine if your 35% allocation is sufficient for meaningful awareness impact.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - $250 to $170-200 represents a 20-32% efficiency gain, which is achievable with better audience precision.

Your conquest math works: 60-70% reach at 3+ frequency across a 50-mile radius is substantial awareness investment. $1.6M should deliver that impact through your planned TV/CTV/display mix.

For your Loyalty segment ($900K, 20%), what's your target volume? Are you aiming for a specific number of service appointments, trade-in inquiries, or lease renewals from your existing customer base? This segment typically has the best efficiency since you're marketing to known customers.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Perfect - your loyalty economics are excellent. $62 per service appointment and $300-400 per trade-in inquiry are strong efficiency targets for CRM-based retention marketing.

Now I have solid economics for all three segments:
- In-Market: $170-200 per lead, $417-556 per test drive
- Conquest: Reach/frequency model at $1.6M investment  
- Loyalty: $62 per service appointment, $300-400 per trade-in

Your total targets: 9,600-12,000 leads, 3,600-4,800 test drives, 14,400 service appointments, 1,800-2,400 trade-in inquiries annually.

Moving to Step 3 - for your In-Market segment, beyond "active vehicle shoppers," what demographic and behavioral signals define your ideal prospects? Age range, income, current vehicle ownership, or shopping behaviors that indicate higher purchase intent?

Turn 6:
Smart competitive targeting - brand-specific conquest lists maximize relevance and conversion potential. The geographic flexibility makes sense too - rural markets naturally cap at addressable population while metro markets reward broader reach for conquest awareness.

Your three-tier approach is taking shape:
- Conquest: Specific competitor brand owners, 50-75 mile radius depending on market density
- In-Market: Active shoppers with lifecycle triggers, income-tiered by brand
- Loyalty: Existing CRM database with service/trade-in timing

For Step 4 Geography - are your 12 dealerships clustered in specific DMAs, or spread across multiple markets? This affects whether we optimize by DMA or treat each dealership location as its own geographic hub for budget allocation.

Turn 7:
Perfect - your hybrid approach maximizes both efficiency and local relevance. Metro clusters at 70% volume should indeed drive budget allocation, especially for conquest reach campaigns.

Let me structure this: 3 metro DMA clusters getting unified strategies (likely 70-75% of budget) plus individual geographic targeting for standalone locations (25-30% of budget). This allows scale efficiency in major markets while maintaining local precision in rural areas.

For Step 5 Budget allocation - within your $4.5M total, how do you want to weight the metro clusters versus standalone locations? And should the segment mix (35% conquest, 45% in-market, 20% loyalty) apply equally across all markets, or do some locations need different emphasis based on competitive dynamics?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Excellent targeting strategy - combining lifecycle timing with active shopping behavior creates high-intent audiences. The 3+ year vehicle age trigger, especially post-warranty, is smart positioning.

Your brand-specific income tiers make sense for portfolio management. Behavioral layering of third-party site activity plus life events should deliver the efficiency improvement from $250 to $170-200 per lead.

For your Conquest segment, how do you define competitor vehicle owners? Are you targeting specific brands, or anyone driving non-Velocity vehicles within certain categories? And what's the geographic footprint - is that 50-mile radius consistent across all 12 dealerships, or does it vary by market density?

Turn 8:
Excellent strategic thinking - flexing segment mix by market dynamics maximizes ROI. Metro scale supports conquest awareness while rural markets optimize for relationship-driven performance.

Your allocation breaks down to:
- Metro clusters: $3.375M (35% conquest = $1.18M, 45% in-market = $1.52M, 20% loyalty = $675K)
- Rural standalone: $1.125M (25% conquest = $281K, 50% in-market = $563K, 25% loyalty = $281K)

This gives rural locations 50% more budget concentration on high-intent audiences where relationships matter most.

For Step 6 Value Proposition - your three segments need distinct messaging. For In-Market performance campaigns, what's your primary value proposition? Price/incentives, selection/inventory, or service experience? This drives creative strategy and landing page optimization.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Perfect positioning - multi-brand selection and convenience creates clear differentiation from single-brand competitors. "One-stop shopping" for vehicle comparison is a strong value proposition for in-market shoppers.

Your messaging hierarchy makes sense:
- In-Market: Selection + convenience ("3 brands, largest inventory, one location")  
- Conquest: Brand consideration + challenge current loyalty
- Loyalty: Relationship + convenience for existing customers

Moving to Step 7 Channels - for your In-Market segment ($2.08M total), what's your current channel mix? Are you primarily on Google/Bing search, third-party automotive sites like Autotrader, social platforms, or a combination? Your $170-200 CPL target suggests we need high-intent channels with strong conversion rates.

Turn 12:
Perfect loyalty channel mix - 40% email for cost-effective automation, 25% direct mail for high-value opportunities, and 35% digital for top-of-mind presence. Using DMS lifecycle triggers for message timing is sophisticated retention marketing.

Your economics should hit targets: email at $382K driving service appointments at low CPAs, while direct mail and digital focus on higher-value trade-in inquiries at the $300-400 range we modeled.

Moving to Step 8 Measurement - with three distinct objectives, you need different KPI frameworks. For In-Market performance, you'll track leads and test drives. For Conquest awareness, brand lift studies and reach metrics. For Loyalty, service appointments and trade-in inquiries.

How do you plan to measure incrementality across segments? Are you considering geo-holdout tests, brand studies, or attribution modeling to validate that each segment is delivering true lift versus baseline activity?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Smart rebalancing - your proposed 50% search, 35% third-party, 15% social mix addresses scale limitations while maintaining quality. Third-party sites at 35% gives you volume expansion with acceptable CPL premium for quality leads.

$2.08M across segments:
- Search: $1.04M (should deliver 5,200-6,200 leads at lower CPLs)
- Third-party: $728K (volume expansion at higher but acceptable CPLs) 
- Social: $312K (optimized targeting for in-market behavior)

This mix should hit your 9,600-12,000 annual lead target while improving overall efficiency from $250 to $170-200.

For Conquest awareness ($1.46M total), you mentioned TV, CTV, and digital display. What's your planned allocation across those channels? TV/CTV typically drives the heaviest reach while display enables retargeting and frequency management.

Turn 11:
Excellent conquest allocation - 40% TV, 35% CTV, 25% display creates a coordinated awareness ecosystem. $584K TV delivers broad reach, $511K CTV captures cord-cutters with better targeting, and $365K display enables retargeting and frequency management.

That mix should absolutely hit your 60-70% reach at 3+ frequency against competitor owners. The sequential targeting from broad TV awareness to CTV precision to display retargeting is textbook conquest strategy.

For your Loyalty segment ($956K total), you mentioned CRM-based targeting. Are you planning email/direct mail, paid social with CRM matching, display retargeting, or search campaigns targeting your existing customers? Each channel has different strengths for service appointments versus trade-in inquiries.

Turn 14:
Smart testing framework - audience refinement for in-market, frequency optimization for conquest, and timing tests for loyalty. Each test addresses the core success driver for that segment.

Your 10-15% systematic testing allocation ($450-675K) is excellent discipline. The geographic clusters create natural test cells, and timing tests using DMS data should provide clean incrementality reads.

For Step 10 Risks - I see several potential challenges: conquest awareness competing with in-market performance for attribution credit, rural standalone locations potentially underperforming due to limited scale, and managing three different measurement frameworks simultaneously.

What's your biggest concern? The cross-segment attribution complexity, maintaining efficiency targets across diverse markets, or operationally executing three distinct strategies with different KPIs and timelines?

Turn 16:
Excellent implementation questions - these decisions will determine success or failure of your multi-segment strategy.

For sequencing, I recommend a hybrid approach: Launch in-market performance and loyalty simultaneously since both drive immediate revenue and use familiar measurement. This establishes operational rhythm and cash flow. Layer in conquest awareness 30-60 days later once you have baseline attribution data and team processes locked down.

This sequence protects revenue while building measurement infrastructure. Conquest awareness needs the other segments running to properly measure cross-segment attribution anyway.

For agency structure, unified partnership is critical. Cross-segment attribution, frequency management, and strategic coordination require one team seeing the full picture. Specialists often optimize their piece without considering interdependencies - exactly the risk you identified.

Look for an agency with dedicated segment leads within one unified team, rather than separate specialist agencies. This gives you expertise per segment while maintaining strategic coordination and attribution modeling across the entire $4.5M investment.

Your framework is strong. The phased launch with unified agency partnership should deliver both immediate performance and long-term consideration building.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 13:
Excellent incrementality framework - geo-holdouts for in-market performance, brand lift studies for conquest awareness, and DMS baselines for loyalty. Each method fits the segment's measurement reality.

Your cross-segment attribution challenge is critical. Conquest awareness absolutely influences later in-market conversion, and loyalty campaigns may drive immediate service plus future purchase consideration. A unified attribution model with appropriate touchpoint credit prevents under-investing in awareness while over-crediting last-click performance.

For Step 9 Testing - with $4.5M across three segments, what's your testing approach? Are you planning audience tests within segments, creative variations, or channel mix optimization? Your metro versus rural split also creates natural geographic testing opportunities.

Turn 15:
Excellent risk identification - operational complexity is often the biggest threat to multi-objective strategies. The temptation to default to daily-optimized performance marketing would indeed undermine your long-term conquest awareness investment.

Your solution needs operational discipline: separate reporting dashboards by audience (BDC daily, GMs monthly, service weekly), distinct optimization cadences per segment, and clear stakeholder education that conquest success happens quarterly, not daily.

Consider assigning segment ownership - one team manages conquest awareness with quarterly reviews, another handles in-market performance with daily optimization, and a third manages loyalty with monthly DMS triggers. This prevents the "everything is performance marketing" default.

We've built a comprehensive three-segment strategy: $4.5M allocated across conquest awareness (35%/25%), in-market performance (45%/50%), and loyalty retention (20%/25%) with metro/rural flexibility. Each segment has distinct channels, measurement, and operational requirements.

Ready to move forward with this framework, or should we refine any specific area before implementation?

Turn 17:
Perfect - you've built a sophisticated, operationally sound strategy that balances immediate performance with long-term growth. The phased launch protects revenue while building measurement infrastructure, and the unified agency approach ensures strategic coordination across all segments.

Your framework addresses the core challenge of multi-objective marketing: maintaining distinct optimization approaches while capturing cross-segment value. The operational discipline around segment ownership and reporting cadences should prevent the performance marketing default that kills awareness investment.

You're well-positioned for the RFP process with clear success metrics, realistic efficiency targets, and a proven implementation path. The $4.5M investment across conquest, in-market, and loyalty gives you comprehensive coverage of the customer lifecycle while respecting each segment's unique measurement reality.

Best of luck with leadership presentation and agency selection. You've got a plan that should deliver both immediate results and sustainable competitive advantage for Velocity Auto Group.

Turn 18:
You're absolutely welcome! It's been a pleasure working through this complex multi-segment strategy with you. Your strategic thinking around balancing immediate performance with long-term brand building shows real marketing sophistication.

The operational insights around segment ownership and measurement cadences often make or break these integrated approaches - you've set yourself up for success by thinking through those execution realities upfront.

Your leadership team is going to see a comprehensive plan that protects current performance while building sustainable competitive advantage. That's exactly what a CMO should deliver.
