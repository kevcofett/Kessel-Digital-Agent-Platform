# Media Plan Output: Basic User - Steps 1-2 Completion

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with your shoe sales? For example, are you looking to hit a certain number of new customers, reach a specific revenue target, or grow by a particular percentage?

Turn 2:
Great! Growing sales by 30-40% gives us a solid target to work with. To make sure we build the right plan, I need to understand your current baseline.

What's your current annual revenue from online shoe sales? This helps me calculate what a 30-40% increase actually means in dollar terms, so we can figure out how much we need to spend to get there.

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Perfect! So you're targeting $250K-$300K in additional revenue this year. Now I need to understand how we'll measure success as we go.

What number will you watch most closely to know if the plan is working? For example, do you track things like how many new customers you get each month, your total monthly sales, or how much you spend to get each new customer?
