# Media Plan Output: Full 10-Step Media Planning

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by calculating your implied efficiency: $750K ÷ 15,000 = $50 per customer acquisition. That's a solid target for home decor/furniture.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 15,000 new customers? For example, are you focused on revenue growth, market share expansion, or building your customer base for long-term retention?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Revenue growth through new customer acquisition is your objective. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success as a number.

Your $50 per customer target looks achievable for home decor, but I need to know: what's the average value of a new customer to you? Do customers typically spend around $100 on their first purchase, or is it higher? This helps me assess if your $50 acquisition cost leaves room for profitable growth.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent! Let me model this out:

**First Purchase Economics:**
- Average first purchase: $190 (midpoint)
- Acquisition cost: $50
- First purchase profit margin: $140 per customer

**Lifetime Value Economics:**
- LTV: $450
- CAC: $50
- LTV/CAC ratio: 9x

That's outstanding unit economics for home decor. Your 9x LTV/CAC ratio is well above the 3x minimum threshold, giving you strong profitability and room for optimization.

**Revenue Projection:**
15,000 customers × $190 first purchase = $2.85M in first-year revenue from new customers, with an additional $6.75M lifetime value.

This efficiency target is definitely achievable and positions you for healthy growth. Ready to move to Step 3 and define your target audience?

Turn 4:
Perfect! Let's define your target audience with precision. Since you're targeting $50 CAC with strong unit economics, we can afford to be selective and focus on high-value segments.

Based on your $190 average order value and home decor focus, I'm expecting your audience skews toward homeowners with disposable income. But let me start with the fundamentals:

Who is your ideal customer? For example, are you primarily targeting homeowners vs. renters, specific age ranges, or particular life stages like new homeowners or people renovating?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Great foundation! Let me build on that profile:

**Core Demographics:**
- Homeowners, ages 30-55, primarily women
- Household income $60K+
- Life stages: new homeowners, renovating, refreshing spaces, empty nesters, growing families

Now I need to understand their behaviors and interests to sharpen targeting. What are the key behavioral signals that indicate someone is likely to buy from HomeStyle Decor? 

For example, do your best customers typically follow home design influencers, shop at specific retailers like West Elm or Pottery Barn, or engage with home renovation content online?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Perfect! That gives us strong targeting signals:

**Behavioral Profile:**
- Follows home design influencers (Studio McGee, Amber Lewis)
- Active on Pinterest for home inspiration
- Shops Target home, HomeGoods, some West Elm/Pottery Barn
- Watches HGTV and home renovation shows
- Seeks affordable alternatives to high-end decor
- Prefers refreshing over full renovation

This audience is highly discoverable across digital channels - Pinterest, Instagram, and Facebook all have excellent targeting for these interests and behaviors.

One more key question: Are there any specific home styles or aesthetics your products align with? For example, modern farmhouse, boho, minimalist, traditional? This will help us target people actively shopping those specific styles.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 7:
Excellent! Now I have a complete audience profile:

**HomeStyle Decor Target Audience:**
- **Demographics:** Homeowners, 30-55, primarily women, $60K+ HHI
- **Life Stages:** New homeowners, renovating, refreshing, empty nesters, growing families
- **Behaviors:** Pinterest active, follows home design influencers, shops Target/HomeGoods, watches HGTV
- **Style Preferences:** Modern farmhouse, transitional, coastal, boho
- **Value Proposition Alignment:** Seeks Pinterest-perfect style at accessible prices

This audience is highly targetable across digital platforms with excellent interest-based and lookalike targeting options.

Ready to move to Step 4 and define your geographic focus? Are you targeting nationally, or do you have specific regions or markets that perform better for HomeStyle Decor?

Turn 8:
Perfect! That geographic pattern makes complete sense - modern farmhouse and transitional styles have strong resonance in those regions, and suburban/mid-size city markets align perfectly with your homeowner focus.

**Geographic Strategy:**
- **Primary:** US national with suburban/mid-size city emphasis
- **Top Regions:** Southeast, Midwest, Texas
- **Style-Geography Fit:** Modern farmhouse resonates strongly in these markets
- **International:** Potential future opportunity

This geographic focus works well for digital targeting - we can use DMA-level targeting for your strongest regions while maintaining national reach for discovery.

One quick question on market prioritization: Do you want to allocate more budget toward your proven strong regions (Southeast, Midwest, Texas) for efficiency, or invest more heavily in expanding into new geographic markets? This will influence how we structure the budget allocation.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 9:
Excellent strategic thinking! That 70/30 split maximizes efficiency while allowing for growth exploration.

**Budget Allocation by Geography:**
- **Proven Markets (70% = $525K):** Southeast, Midwest, Texas - focus on scaling what works
- **Expansion Markets (30% = $225K):** Pacific Northwest, Northeast - test new opportunity

This gives us $525K to drive 10,500 customers in proven markets at your target $50 CAC, plus $225K to test 4,500 customers in expansion markets. The proven markets should deliver reliable performance while expansion tests new growth potential.

Ready to move to Step 5 and refine your budget structure? I want to explore how to allocate between acquisition and retention, and whether seasonal patterns affect your spending strategy.

Turn 10:
Perfect! Your seasonal insights are valuable - spring refreshing and fall nesting are natural buying cycles for home decor.

Let me model a strategic budget allocation:

**Acquisition vs. Retention Split:**
With your 9x LTV/CAC ratio, I recommend 80% acquisition ($600K) and 20% retention ($150K). This balances growth with maximizing that strong lifetime value.

**Budget Breakdown:**
- **Acquisition:** $600K → 12,000 new customers
- **Retention:** $150K → re-engage existing customers for additional purchases

**Seasonal Allocation:**
Given your spring/fall peaks, should we weight spending toward those periods? For example, 40% in spring (March-May), 40% in fall (September-November), and 20% in other months? Or do you prefer more even distribution to maintain consistent growth?

Turn 11:
Excellent! That seasonal strategy maximizes efficiency by aligning spend with natural buying cycles.

**Final Budget Structure:**
- **Total:** $750K (80% acquisition, 20% retention)
- **Geographic:** 70% proven markets, 30% expansion
- **Seasonal:** 40% spring, 40% fall, 20% other months

This projects to 12,000 new customers plus retention campaign reach, with concentrated firepower during your peak converting seasons.

Ready to move to Step 6 and develop your value proposition? I want to understand how HomeStyle Decor positions itself against competitors. You mentioned being an affordable alternative to West Elm/Pottery Barn with Pinterest-perfect style - let's sharpen that messaging for your media campaigns.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 10: Risks

Turn 12:
Great foundation! "Get the designer look for less" captures the core value, but let's make it more emotionally resonant for your target audience.

Your customers aren't just buying furniture - they're creating the Pinterest-perfect home they've been dreaming about. They want that Studio McGee aesthetic but need it to fit their real-world budget.

**Refined Value Proposition Options:**
- "Pinterest-perfect style, family-friendly prices"
- "Designer looks that don't break the budget"
- "Your dream home aesthetic, finally affordable"

Which direction feels most authentic to HomeStyle Decor? Or does a different angle resonate more with how your customers talk about their home goals?

I want to ensure our messaging connects with that emotional desire to create a beautiful home, not just save money.
