# Media Plan Output: High-Stakes Performance Campaign

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start - you've provided strong context. Let me quickly check your efficiency target: $2M ÷ 50,000 = $40 per merchant acquisition. With $850 LTV, that's a healthy 21x ratio - very achievable for B2B fintech.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 50,000 new merchants? For example, are you focused on transaction volume growth, market share expansion, or revenue milestones?

Turn 3:
Got it - front-loaded acquisition with $1.2M budget for 30,000 merchants in H1, then $800K for 20,000 in H2. That means you need to hit $40 CAC consistently while scaling fast - ambitious but doable.

Your H1 pace requires 5,000 merchants per month starting February. At $40 CAC, that's $200K monthly ad spend with tight conversion requirements. The board pressure adds urgency but your LTV/CAC ratio provides cushion if efficiency slips slightly during rapid scaling.

How do you currently measure success for merchant acquisition - is it purely new merchant count, or do you track specific revenue milestones or processing volume thresholds that define a "successful" merchant?

Turn 4:
Perfect - that activation threshold is crucial. 85% retention at $10K+ monthly processing versus 45% below shows why quality matters more than raw volume.

This changes your economics significantly. If you acquire 50,000 merchants but only 70% hit the $10K threshold, your effective acquisition becomes:
- 35,000 high-value merchants at $57 CAC ($2M ÷ 35,000)
- 15,000 low-value merchants essentially wasted spend

At $57 CAC against $850 LTV for activated merchants, you're still at 15x return - strong but tighter margins for error.

Do you have data on what percentage of your current merchant acquisitions typically hit that $10K monthly processing threshold? This will help us model realistic conversion funnels and potentially adjust the 50,000 target.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Excellent - ARR growth through aggressive SMB market expansion is clear. Your $42M revenue target from 50,000 merchants implies $840 average annual revenue per merchant, which aligns well with your $850 LTV.

Now let's validate the economics. At $40 per merchant acquisition cost against $850 LTV, you're targeting a 21x return - that's very strong for B2B fintech. Based on industry benchmarks, SMB merchant acquisition typically runs $50-$150, so your $40 target is aggressive but achievable with tight execution.

One key consideration: your "scale fast" objective suggests you'll want to reach that 50,000 quickly rather than pacing over 12 months. 

What timeframe are you working with to acquire these 50,000 merchants?

Turn 6:
Smart approach - revenue target as north star with activation rate as your early warning system. The 55% floor is wise risk management.

Your activation insight reveals the key challenge: referrals/inbound convert at 75% because they're pre-qualified, but paid media will pull from a broader, less committed pool. This suggests we need audience segmentation that mimics your high-intent referral characteristics.

For Step 3, we need to identify what signals differentiate your 75% activation merchants from lower performers. This will guide our targeting strategy to maintain quality while scaling.

What characteristics do your best-activating merchants share? For example, business type, revenue size, current payment processing pain points, or geographic patterns?

Turn 7:
Perfect - this gives us a clear audience blueprint. Service businesses in $50K-$300K revenue range with existing payment processor pain points are your activation sweet spot.

The geographic pattern is telling: SF/NYC/Austin suggests tech-forward business environments where switching costs feel lower and fintech adoption is normalized. This concentration could actually help your media efficiency.

Key insight: your referral partners (accountants/consultants) are essentially pre-qualifying prospects for payment processing dissatisfaction. In paid media, we'll need targeting that identifies similar pain signals - businesses likely frustrated with incumbents.

Before we dive into specific audience segments, what geographic footprint are you targeting? Are you focusing on those high-activation metros, expanding nationally, or somewhere in between?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Exactly right - scaling into colder audiences will compress activation rates. Let's model the realistic scenario:

**Conservative Activation Modeling:**
- 50,000 total acquisitions at 60% activation = 30,000 activated merchants
- $2M ÷ 30,000 activated = $67 CAC for quality merchants
- $67 vs $850 LTV = 12.7x return - still viable but much tighter

**Your Risk/Reward Trade-off:**
- Board gets their 50,000 merchant count for reporting
- You get 30,000 revenue-generating merchants toward $100M ARR
- But margin for error shrinks significantly at $67 effective CAC

This suggests we'll need surgical audience targeting and strong creative testing to maintain activation rates as we scale into colder segments.

Given this activation challenge, what's your primary KPI for measuring campaign success - total merchant acquisitions, activated merchants, or the $42M revenue target?

Turn 8:
Excellent strategy - tiered geographic expansion balances growth with risk management. Your proven metros provide the activation rate foundation while secondary markets offer scale potential and competitive advantages.

This tiered approach suggests different budget allocation and efficiency expectations by market type:

**Tier 1 (Current 15 metros):** Higher spend concentration, $35-40 CAC targets, 65-70% activation rates
**Tier 2 (Secondary markets):** Test budgets initially, potentially $45-50 CAC, 55-60% activation rates

The "less fintech saturation" insight is key - secondary markets might have pent-up demand but require more education and trust-building in creative messaging.

For Step 4 planning, should we structure this as a DMA-level geographic strategy? I'd recommend starting with your top 10 current metros plus 10-15 expansion DMAs, then we can model population, business density, and budget allocation by market tier.

What are your top 5 current metros by performance, and which 5-10 secondary markets are highest priority for expansion?

Turn 9:
Perfect geographic strategy. Your tiered approach with budget flexibility is smart - start conservative, then reallocate based on performance data.

Let me structure this as a DMA table with your target business populations:

**TIER 1 - PROVEN METROS (70% initial budget = $1.4M)**
- San Francisco Bay Area: ~45K service businesses in $50K-$300K range
- New York: ~85K target businesses  
- Austin: ~18K target businesses
- Seattle: ~25K target businesses
- Boston: ~30K target businesses
- Chicago: ~40K target businesses
- Los Angeles: ~55K target businesses

**TIER 2 - EXPANSION MARKETS (30% initial budget = $600K)**
- Denver, Nashville, Phoenix, Raleigh-Durham, Salt Lake City: ~15-25K target businesses each

This gives us roughly 350K+ serviceable businesses across all DMAs - plenty of scale for your 50K target with room for selectivity.

Should we model the initial 70/30 budget split, or do you want to see specific DMA allocations within each tier based on business density?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 10:
Smart approach - weight by performance, not just density. Let me model specific DMA allocations:

**TIER 1 ALLOCATION ($1.4M - 70%)**
- SF Bay Area: $300K (21%) - top performer
- NYC: $280K (20%) - top performer  
- Austin: $200K (14%) - strong performance, good efficiency
- Seattle: $180K (13%) - solid performance
- Boston: $160K (11%) - proven market
- Chicago: $140K (10%) - competitive but viable
- LA: $140K (10%) - large market, higher competition

**TIER 2 ALLOCATION ($600K - 30%)**
- 5 test markets at $50K each = $250K initial
- $350K reserve for doubling down on winners

This gives you $50K test budgets across Denver, Nashville, Phoenix, Raleigh-Durham, Salt Lake City, with significant reserve capital to 3-4x the best performers once you have 60-90 days of data.

At these allocations, SF Bay Area targets ~1,500 merchants, NYC ~1,400, while test markets aim for ~250 each initially.

Does this allocation strategy align with your risk tolerance and learning objectives?

Turn 11:
Excellent point - front-loaded H1 acquisition changes the risk calculus. Let me remodel for faster learning cycles:

**H1 REVISED ALLOCATION ($1.2M)**
- Proven metros: $1M (83%) - maximize volume in known markets
- Expansion test: $125K (5 markets × $25K) - rapid learning
- Reserve: $75K for quick winner scaling

**PROVEN METROS H1 ($1M):**
- SF Bay Area: $220K, NYC: $200K, Austin: $150K
- Seattle: $140K, Boston: $130K, Chicago: $80K, LA: $80K

This gets you ~1,800 merchants from SF/NYC alone in H1, while the $25K tests generate 125-150 merchants per expansion market - enough data to identify winners by Month 2.

Then H2 becomes your expansion acceleration phase with the remaining $800K heavily weighted toward proven expansion markets.

This approach prioritizes your 30,000 H1 target while building the foundation for H2 scaling. Sound right?

Turn 12:
Great question about channels, and I can see why you're thinking LinkedIn and Google given your B2B focus. We'll dive deep into channel strategy in Step 7 once we have the full foundation built.

But first, let's lock in your value proposition framework since that directly impacts channel performance. Your expansion into secondary markets means we need messaging that works both in fintech-savvy metros and less saturated markets.

Based on what you've shared, your core value prop seems to center on solving payment processor pain points - high fees, poor service, limited functionality. But the messaging might need to vary between markets where businesses readily switch (SF/NYC) versus markets where switching feels riskier.

What's your current primary value proposition when talking to prospects, and do you think it resonates equally across your proven metros and expansion markets?
