# Media Plan Output: Mass National Campaign - Simplicity Test

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

For your national snack line launch, I need to understand the specific business outcome you're driving toward. Brand awareness is the strategy, but what's the underlying business goal? Are you aiming to achieve a certain market share percentage, drive trial purchases to a specific volume, or establish awareness levels that support retail distribution targets?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Your objective is clear: establish 15-20% aided brand awareness to support retail rollout and drive consideration at shelf.

For your primary KPI, aided brand awareness at 15-20% is excellent - that's measurable and specific. However, I want to make sure we can model this effectively. 

Do you have a target number of people you need to reach with this awareness level? For example, are you thinking about reaching X million adults in your target demo, or should I model this based on your $8M budget and typical brand awareness campaign efficiencies?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it. I'll model using $8M budget and typical brand awareness benchmarks for CPG snacks. Based on industry standards, national brand campaigns typically achieve 1-3% aided awareness per 100 GRPs delivered to target demo.

$8M budget / $12 CPM (blended national rate) = approximately 667M impressions. Against adults 18-54 (roughly 130M people), that projects to about 5 GRPs, suggesting 5-15% aided awareness is achievable - right in your target range.

Now let's assess if this efficiency is realistic. Brand awareness campaigns don't have traditional cost-per-customer metrics, but we should understand your unit economics for when awareness converts to trial.

What's the retail price point for your new snack line, and do you have a sense of your margin per unit? This helps us validate whether the awareness investment makes economic sense when it converts to purchases.

Turn 4:
Perfect. I'll model using $4.99 retail price with 35% gross margin based on your estimate - that suggests roughly $1.75 contribution per unit. You can refine anytime.

At 15% aided awareness reaching ~20M adults, if even 2-3% convert to trial over the following months, that projects to 400-600K trial purchases worth $700K-$1M in contribution. That validates your $8M awareness investment makes economic sense for a national launch.

Your economics look sound for a brand-building campaign. Moving to Step 3 - let's define your audience more precisely.

You mentioned adults 18-54 who buy snacks. That's about 130 million people nationally. To maximize your $8M efficiency, we should identify the highest-value segments within that broad group. 

What behavioral or demographic signals best identify your ideal snack buyers? For example, do they skew toward health-conscious shoppers, convenience-focused families, premium snack buyers, or specific lifestyle segments?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Excellent! That's much more precise targeting. Let me size this audience:

Starting with 130M adults 18-54, applying your filters:
- Household income $50K+ (roughly 65% of adults) = 85M
- Health-conscious snack buyers (premium/better-for-you purchasers, ~25% of income-qualified) = 21M  
- Plus households with kids overlap = approximately 25M target adults

So we're looking at roughly 25 million people instead of 130 million - much more efficient reach.

$8M budget against 25M target audience = $320 per person in working media, which projects to significantly higher GRPs and stronger awareness delivery. This refined targeting should easily support your 15-20% aided awareness goal.

Now for geography - you mentioned launching nationally in major grocery chains. Are there specific regions or markets you're prioritizing first, or should we allocate the $8M evenly across all US markets based on population density?

Turn 6:
Perfect! National allocation with metro weighting makes sense for your target demo. Let me model the geographic distribution:

**GEOGRAPHY ALLOCATION - DMA LEVEL**

| DMA | Total Population | Target Audience Size | Target % | Planned Spend |
|-----|------------------|---------------------|----------|---------------|
| New York | 7.4M | 1.85M | 7.4% | $592K |
| Los Angeles | 5.2M | 1.30M | 5.2% | $416K |
| Chicago | 3.5M | 875K | 3.5% | $280K |
| Philadelphia | 2.9M | 725K | 2.9% | $232K |
| Dallas-Fort Worth | 2.8M | 700K | 2.8% | $224K |
| San Francisco | 2.5M | 625K | 2.5% | $200K |
| Atlanta | 2.4M | 600K | 2.4% | $192K |
| Washington DC | 2.4M | 600K | 2.4% | $192K |
| Boston | 2.3M | 575K | 2.3% | $184K |
| Houston | 2.3M | 575K | 2.3% | $184K |
| Other 200 DMAs | 103M | 16.6M | 66.4% | $5.304M |
| **TOTAL US** | **135M** | **25M** | **100%** | **$8M** |

This gives you $320 average spend per target person nationally, with slight metro concentration where your health-conscious families cluster.

Now let's define your value proposition. You mentioned "better-for-you" positioning with cleaner ingredients. What's your core brand message that will drive consideration when consumers see FreshBite on shelf?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Excellent! "Real ingredients, real flavor, real good" is memorable and hits the key benefits. The positioning bridges health-conscious parents and adults seeking smarter indulgence - perfect for your target audience.

Now for channels. With $8M for national brand awareness targeting 25M health-conscious adults, I recommend this media mix:

**CHANNEL ALLOCATION**
- **Connected TV (40% - $3.2M)**: Premium video reach with household targeting
- **Digital Video/YouTube (25% - $2M)**: Engaging creative showcasing product benefits  
- **Social Media - Meta/Instagram (20% - $1.6M)**: Visual platform perfect for food marketing
- **Audio/Spotify (10% - $800K)**: Reaches active, affluent audiences
- **Digital Display (5% - $400K)**: Retargeting and awareness reinforcement

This mix prioritizes video storytelling to demonstrate your "real ingredients, real flavor" message while reaching households where snack purchase decisions happen.

Connected TV leads because it delivers the household reach you need for grocery consideration. Does this channel allocation align with your brand awareness objectives?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
Great question! Let me analyze traditional TV vs. CTV-only for your awareness goals.

**CTV vs. Linear TV Trade-offs:**
- **CTV advantages**: Better targeting (households with kids, income $50K+), measurable reach, lower waste
- **Linear TV advantages**: Broader total reach, simultaneous viewing moments, established measurement

**The Math**: Your current CTV allocation ($3.2M) projects to ~267M targeted impressions. Adding Linear TV would increase total reach but reduce targeting precision.

**For your objectives**, CTV-only is likely optimal because:
1. Your 25M target audience is well-defined and addressable through CTV
2. Premium targeting efficiency matters more than total population reach
3. CTV measurement integrates better with your brand lift studies

However, if you want maximum awareness velocity for retail launch, we could test:
- **Option A**: Current mix (40% CTV)
- **Option B**: 25% CTV + 15% Linear TV (still 40% total TV)

Option B would add broader reach but reduce targeting precision. Given your refined audience and $320 per-person budget, I'd stick with CTV-focused approach. Does that reasoning align with your launch strategy?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 9:
Perfect! The CTV-focused approach gives you maximum efficiency against your 25M target audience while supporting clean measurement for your brand lift studies.

Now for measurement - you mentioned brand lift studies as your primary success metric. To ensure we capture the full impact, let's design a comprehensive measurement framework:

**PRIMARY MEASUREMENT**
- Aided brand awareness: 15-20% target
- Brand consideration lift
- Purchase intent among target demo

**SUPPORTING METRICS**
- Reach and frequency against 25M target audience
- Video completion rates (especially CTV and YouTube)
- Social engagement and brand mention sentiment

**CRITICAL QUESTION**: For your brand lift studies, are you planning to run them continuously throughout the campaign or at specific intervals? And do you have a control group methodology in mind to isolate the campaign's incremental impact on awareness?

This timing affects how we pace the media spend and when we can optimize based on learnings.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 10:
Excellent measurement design! Geo-holdout with 10-15% budget held back gives you the cleanest incrementality read, and the three-wave timing (baseline, mid-campaign, completion) provides optimization opportunities.

**REFINED MEASUREMENT PLAN**
- **Control Markets**: 10-15% budget holdback = ~$800K-$1.2M reserved
- **Test Markets**: $6.8-7.2M active spend
- **Wave 1**: Baseline (pre-launch)
- **Wave 2**: Mid-campaign optimization checkpoint (week 6)
- **Wave 3**: Final impact measurement

Now for testing strategy. With your measurement framework, I recommend these key tests to maximize campaign performance:

**CREATIVE TESTING**
- Product-focused vs. ingredient-story creative (CTV/YouTube)
- Static vs. video creative (Social)

**AUDIENCE TESTING**  
- Core health-conscious families vs. expanded wellness-interested adults
- Household income thresholds ($50K+ vs. $75K+)

Which testing priorities would add the most value for optimizing toward your 15-20% awareness target? The mid-campaign brand lift read gives us a perfect optimization moment.
