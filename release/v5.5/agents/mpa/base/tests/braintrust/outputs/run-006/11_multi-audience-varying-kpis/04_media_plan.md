# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience with Different KPIs Per Segment

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build this multi-segment media plan with you. This is sophisticated work - three distinct objectives with different measurement frameworks and customer lifecycles. We'll cover ten areas for each segment: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks.

Your segment structure is smart. Let's start with Conquest since awareness campaigns need the longest runway and different success metrics.

**Conquest Segment - Awareness Objective**
Budget: ~$1.58M (35% of $4.5M)

For your conquest awareness play targeting competitor vehicle owners, what specific brand consideration shift are you trying to achieve? For example, are you measuring aided brand awareness, consideration lift in surveys, or brand search volume increases?

Turn 2:
Perfect - quarterly brand health surveys measuring consideration lift is your primary KPI, with brand search as a supporting signal. The multi-brand complexity adds strategic depth.

For consideration lift measurement, what baseline and target are you working with? For example, are you starting from 15% aided awareness targeting 25%, or looking at consideration scores like moving from 8% to 15% "would consider" among competitor owners?

This will help determine if we need foundational reach campaigns for the newer brands versus more targeted consideration messaging for the established one.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent data. Let me model the efficiency implications:

**Established Brand:** 22% → 35% awareness (+13pts), 12% → 18% consideration (+6pts)
**Newer Brands:** 8% → 20% awareness (+12pts each), 4% → 10% consideration (+6pts each)

That's significant lift targets across three brands. With your ~$1.58M conquest budget, we're looking at driving awareness and consideration gains across a substantial competitor owner population.

Before we assess if this efficiency is achievable, what's the estimated size of your competitor owner audience across your 12 dealership markets? Are we targeting owners of specific competing brands (Toyota, Honda, Ford) or broader "non-Velocity" vehicle owners?

The audience size will determine if your budget can generate the reach frequency needed for these awareness lifts.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Smart geographic discipline. Let me calculate the efficiency:

**$1.58M / 850K competitor owners = $1.86 per person reached**

That's strong efficiency for awareness campaigns. At typical automotive awareness benchmarks of $2-4 per person for meaningful reach/frequency, your budget should support the lift targets.

The 50-mile radius constraint is strategically sound - awareness without drivable proximity wastes spend. Your established brand targeting 13-point awareness lift and newer brands needing 12-point foundational awareness each have realistic budgets at this efficiency.

Now let's move to your **In-Market Lead Gen segment** - the performance piece.

Budget: ~$2.03M (45% of $4.5M)
Objective: VDP views, form fills, calls, test drive appointments

What's your target volume for qualified leads across the 12 dealerships? And what do you consider a qualified lead worth in terms of close rate and average transaction value?

Turn 6:
Perfect. Let me model the retention economics:

**15,000 service appointments × $250 avg value = $3.75M**
**2,500 trade-in inquiries × $10K avg value = $25M**
**Total retention value: $28.75M**

**$900K budget / $28.75M value = 3.1% marketing cost ratio**

That's exceptionally efficient retention marketing. Your $900K investment targeting existing customers with known purchase/service history should easily drive these volumes.

The key insight: trade-in inquiries are 40x more valuable than service appointments ($10K vs $250), so budget allocation within retention should heavily favor trade-in messaging to customers approaching trade cycles.

Now I have enough data to assess all three segments. Your total efficiency looks realistic:

**Conquest:** $1.86 per person for awareness lift - achievable
**Lead Gen:** $226 per qualified lead at 21:1 return - strong  
**Retention:** 3.1% cost ratio on high-value actions - excellent

Ready to move to Step 3 and define your audience segments more precisely? We'll need different targeting approaches for each objective.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Got it. I'll model using 9,000 qualified leads (midpoint) and $4,750 average lead value based on your ranges. You can refine these anytime.

**$2.03M / 9,000 leads = $226 per qualified lead**

At $4,750 average lead value, that's a 21:1 return ratio - very healthy for automotive lead gen where 15-20:1 is typical.

You're absolutely right about the "qualified" definition being critical. Loose qualification inflates volume but destroys close rates and skews economics. 

Your implied $226 CPL is achievable if qualification is tight - intent signals like VDP views, form completions with real contact info, and inbound calls. The efficiency looks realistic for automotive performance marketing.

Now let's tackle **Loyalty/Retention** - your existing customer segment.

Budget: ~$900K (20% of $4.5M)  
Objective: Service appointments, trade-in inquiries, lease renewals

What's your target volume for retention actions, and how do you value a retained service customer versus a trade-in conversion?

Turn 8:
Smart dual-layer approach. Registration data for precision, behavioral for scale expansion.

**Registration targeting:** Higher CPMs ($8-12) but precise competitor owner identification
**Behavioral targeting:** Lower CPMs ($4-7) but broader "in-consideration" audience

Your strategic split makes sense - established brand can afford higher CPMs for precise targeting since you're driving consideration lift, while newer brands need cost-efficient reach for foundational awareness building.

Within your 850K registered competitor owners, do you have visibility into vehicle age or lease timing? Knowing who's driving 2019-2021 vehicles (approaching trade cycle) versus 2023-2024 vehicles (years away from purchase) could help prioritize spend within the conquest segment.

Or are you treating all competitor owners equally for awareness, regardless of purchase timing?

Turn 9:
Exactly. That timing segmentation creates a natural bridge between conquest and lead gen objectives.

**2019-2021 owners:** Higher frequency awareness + consideration messaging (closer to purchase)
**2023-2024 owners:** Lower frequency awareness for future consideration

This suggests your conquest audience actually has two sub-segments with different messaging and frequency strategies, which will affect budget allocation within that $1.58M.

Now let's define your **In-Market Lead Gen audience**. 

You mentioned active vehicle shoppers browsing Autotrader, Cars.com, and checking reviews. Are you targeting based on specific behavioral signals like recent VDP views, comparison shopping activity, or financing research? And do you target broadly across all vehicle types or focus on the specific models/segments your 12 dealerships carry?

Turn 10:
Perfect targeting precision. You're intercepting active research behavior for your specific inventory within driveable geography - that's why your $226 CPL efficiency looks achievable.

**Behavioral recency:** 30-day window captures peak shopping intent
**Inventory alignment:** Targeting segments you actually sell improves conversion  
**Geographic discipline:** 50-mile radius ensures qualified traffic

The model-specific targeting by brand positioning is smart - established brand competing in competitive sedan/compact SUV space versus newer brands in truck/full-size SUV segments with different consideration dynamics.

Now for **Loyalty/Retention audience** - your existing customer database.

You mentioned mixed engagement levels and lifecycle timing being critical. How do you segment your existing customers? Are you primarily using purchase date, service history, engagement scores, or a combination for targeting the right retention message at the right time?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Exactly right. The lifecycle timing precision for retention and the engagement variance add complexity that will drive channel selection later.

**Step 3: Audience Definition**

Let's start with your **Conquest audience** since that's the most complex targeting challenge.

For the 850K competitor owners within 50 miles of your dealerships, how do you plan to identify and target Toyota/Honda/Ford/Chevy owners for media activation? 

Are you using third-party automotive data providers, registration-based targeting, or behavioral signals like visiting competitor websites and research activity? The targeting method will determine reach precision and CPMs across your three brands.

Turn 12:
Smart performance-based allocation approach. Let me help structure this geographically.

**Market Size:** Top 3 metros = 60% of opportunity
**Competitive Intensity:** Saturated vs. less competitive markets affect CPMs and breakthrough
**Dealer Performance:** Lead conversion rates and CLV should drive investment levels

This suggests a tiered allocation strategy rather than equal distribution. High-performing dealers in large, less saturated markets get premium allocation, while underperforming locations get reduced spend until operational issues are resolved.

Within your $4.5M total budget, are you thinking roughly 60% to your top 3 metros with the remaining 40% distributed across the other 9 locations based on performance metrics? Or do you need a different geographic weighting approach?

This allocation will affect audience reach and frequency calculations within each segment.

Turn 13:
Perfect strategic discipline. Marketing investment should follow operational excellence, not just market size.

**Top 3 metros:** ~65% allocation ($2.93M) - large markets + best dealer performance
**Other 9 locations:** ~35% allocation ($1.57M) - performance-ranked distribution
**Bottom 2-3 locations:** Maintenance-level spend until operational improvement

This performance-based allocation protects ROI while incentivizing dealer excellence. You're absolutely right that broken dealership experience destroys marketing investment.

**Step 5: Budget Allocation**

Now let's break down your $4.5M across segments and geography:

**Conquest (35%):** $1.58M → $1.03M to top 3 metros, $550K to other 9
**Lead Gen (45%):** $2.03M → $1.32M to top 3 metros, $710K to other 9  
**Retention (20%):** $900K → $585K to top 3 metros, $315K to other 9

Does this geographic distribution within each segment align with your market opportunity and dealer performance expectations?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Excellent multi-factor segmentation approach. The engagement score driving channel selection is particularly sophisticated - dormant customers do need different activation strategies than engaged ones.

**Trade-in timing:** 30-40 month lease cycle, 4-6 years purchase cycle with mileage overlay
**Service timing:** Overdue maintenance + scheduled interval approaches  
**Channel selection:** Engagement level determines touchpoint strategy

The CRM data quality variance across 12 locations is a common multi-location challenge that will affect measurement precision but shouldn't block the overall strategy.

Your audience definition is complete across all three segments. Each has distinct targeting approaches aligned with objectives.

**Step 4: Geography**

With 12 dealerships across multiple markets, do you need different budget allocations by location based on market size, competitive intensity, or dealership performance? Or are you planning roughly equal allocation across all locations within each segment?

Turn 14:
Excellent strategic refinement. Focus conquest investment where dealerships can capitalize on increased awareness.

**Revised approach:**
- **Top 3 metros:** Full tri-segment allocation ($2.93M)
- **Next 5-6 locations:** Conquest + Lead Gen + Retention 
- **Bottom 3-4 locations:** Retention-focused + minimal Lead Gen only

This concentrates your awareness building in markets with proven conversion capability while maintaining customer retention everywhere. The bottom locations keep existing customers engaged without wasting conquest budget on awareness they can't convert.

**Step 6: Value Proposition**

Each segment needs different messaging approaches. Your conquest messaging differs by brand maturity (foundational awareness vs. consideration), lead gen focuses on competitive advantages, and retention emphasizes service value and trade-in opportunities.

For your **established brand's conquest messaging**, what key differentiators drive consideration against Toyota/Honda/Ford/Chevy? Price, reliability, features, dealer experience, or something else?

Turn 15:
Perfect differentiation strategy. Each brand's messaging aligns with its market position and competitive reality.

**Established brand:** "Smart upgrade" positioning - proven reliability + modern tech + superior service experience
**Newer brands:** Feature/value focus - capability parity at better economics

Your "why pay more for less" messaging against Toyota/Honda leverages their price premium vulnerability while your truck/SUV value propositions attack on concrete benefits rather than intangible brand equity.

For **lead gen messaging**, when someone is actively shopping and comparing, what specific advantages do you lead with to drive the VDP view or form fill? Are you emphasizing inventory availability, pricing transparency, financing options, or something else that converts research into action?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 16:
Spot-on lead gen messaging. You're solving the two biggest automotive shopping frustrations - availability uncertainty and pricing games.

**"In Stock Now" + Transparent Pricing + Real Financing** directly addresses shopper pain points and creates urgency. Active shoppers will engage when they can see actual inventory, real prices, and genuine payment options.

For **retention messaging**, you mentioned different approaches for service versus trade-in timing. What specific value propositions drive action for each?

Service messaging for customers due for maintenance versus trade-in messaging for those approaching lease end or high mileage - what resonates most with your existing customer base to generate those appointments and inquiries?

Turn 17:
Excellent retention messaging strategy. You're positioning as the financial advisor, not just the vendor.

**Service:** "We know your vehicle" + "No surprises" + convenience = trust-based value
**Trade-in:** "Peak equity timing" + depreciation avoidance = financial protection messaging

The "looking out for your interests" approach is sophisticated - you're selling financial wisdom, not just products. That builds long-term loyalty beyond individual transactions.

Your value propositions are well-defined across all three segments. Ready for **Step 7: Channels**?

Each segment will need different channel strategies:
- Conquest needs reach and frequency for awareness
- Lead gen needs intent-capture channels 
- Retention needs owned media + reactivation channels

For **conquest awareness**, what channels are you considering for reaching those 850K competitor owners with your foundational awareness and consideration messaging?

Turn 18:
Smart channel strategy that matches reach objectives with targeting precision.

**TV/CTV:** Broad reach for foundational awareness (newer brands weighted heavier)
**YouTube:** Longer storytelling for consideration (established brand weighted heavier)  
**Display:** Retargeting behavioral signals across the research journey

Your creative adaptation by channel is critical - 30-second awareness spots versus 2-minute YouTube stories versus display banners require completely different messaging approaches.

For **lead gen channels**, you need intent-capture at the moment of active shopping. What channels are you planning to intercept those behavioral signals - search, social, automotive sites, or other activation points where active shoppers can convert to leads?

Turn 20:
Perfect engagement-based channel strategy. You're matching touchpoint intensity to customer responsiveness.

**High-engagement:** Email + CRM retargeting (responsive audience)
**Dormant customers:** Direct mail + aggressive display frequency (breakthrough strategy)
**High-value trade-ins:** BDC phone calls (personal touch for big opportunities)

The 90-day digital silence trigger for increased frequency is smart - you're identifying when digital channels have lost effectiveness and shifting tactics.

Your channel strategies are well-aligned across all segments:
- Conquest: TV/CTV/YouTube/Display for reach and consideration
- Lead Gen: Search/Social/Auto Sites for intent capture  
- Retention: Email/CRM/Direct Mail/Display based on engagement

**Step 8: Measurement**

Each segment needs different success metrics. Your conquest uses quarterly brand health surveys, lead gen tracks qualified leads and conversion, retention measures service appointments and trade-in inquiries.

What attribution approach are you using for lead gen to ensure you're measuring true incremental leads versus organic traffic?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 19:
Excellent lead gen funnel strategy. You're capturing intent at multiple research stages.

**Search:** Highest intent capture - branded, model-specific, competitive conquest
**Social:** Behavioral retargeting with inventory-specific creative  
**Third-party auto sites:** Marketplace presence + warm lead retargeting
**Native content:** Research phase intercept before marketplace behavior

Your "In Stock Now" messaging with specific inventory on social should convert well since you're targeting demonstrated automotive research behavior with immediate availability.

For **retention channels**, you have owned customer data plus varying engagement levels. What channels are you using to activate high-engagement versus dormant customers for service appointments and trade-in inquiries?
