TURN 1 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Hi! I'm looking to get more people to buy shoes from our online store. Can you help me figure out the best way to do that?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve? For example, are you looking to get more new customers, increase sales from existing customers, or something else?

TURN 2 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I think we want to get more new customers mainly. We've been doing okay with our current customers, but we really need to grow our customer base to hit our sales goals this year. Getting new people to discover StepRight Shoes and make their first purchase is probably our biggest priority right now.

AGENT:
Perfect! Growing your customer base is a clear objective. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success.

What number would tell you this campaign is working? For example, is it the total number of new customers you want to bring in, or a specific dollar amount in new sales from first-time buyers?

TURN 3 (Step 3)

USER:
Hmm, that's a good question. I think we'd probably want to focus on the number of new customers since that's what we're really trying to grow. We haven't really set a specific target yet though - maybe something like getting a few thousand new customers? I'm not sure what's realistic with our budget, but we definitely want to see a meaningful increase from where we are now.

AGENT:
Got it - new customers is the right focus. To help figure out what's realistic, I need a rough target to work with.

How many new customers would feel like a meaningful win for you? Even a ballpark number helps - are we talking hundreds, a few thousand, or more? We can always adjust once we look at the budget and see what's achievable.

TURN 4 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I'd say maybe around 2,000 to 3,000 new customers would feel like a real success for us. That would be a pretty big jump from what we normally see, so it would definitely feel meaningful. I'm honestly not sure if that's too ambitious or not enough, but somewhere in that range seems like it would make a real difference for our business.

AGENT:
Excellent! Let's work with 2,500 new customers as your target - right in the middle of your range. That gives us a solid goal to build around.

Now I need to understand your economics to see if this target is realistic. How much can you afford to spend to get one new customer? For example, if a typical new customer spends $80 on their first order, you might be able to spend $30-40 to acquire them and still be profitable.

TURN 5 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I'm not really sure about those numbers to be honest. I know our shoes typically sell for around $60 to $120, but I haven't really calculated how much we can spend to get a new customer. Maybe around $30 or $40 like you mentioned? That sounds reasonable but I'd probably need to double-check with our finance team to make sure we're not spending too much.

AGENT:
Got it. I'll model using $35 cost per customer based on your price range - that's typically achievable for footwear businesses. You can refine this anytime after checking with your finance team.

At $35 per customer for 2,500 new customers, that projects to an $87,500 budget:

$35 × 2,500 = $87,500

Does a budget around $85-90K feel realistic for this campaign, or should we adjust either the customer target or the efficiency to better match what you can invest?

TURN 6 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Actually, we have about $250,000 to spend on this, so $85-90K sounds pretty conservative. With that bigger budget, could we get way more than 2,500 new customers? I'm thinking if we have more money to work with, maybe we should be more ambitious with our target.

AGENT:
Absolutely! With $250,000, you have much more capacity. Let me show you the math:

$250,000 ÷ $35 = 7,143 new customers

That's nearly triple your original target! This budget gives you serious growth potential.

However, I want to check if $35 per customer is realistic at that scale. Based on footwear industry benchmarks, customer acquisition costs typically range from $25-60 depending on your approach. Your $35 target is achievable but will require focused audience targeting and efficient channel selection.

Does going after 7,000+ new customers feel right for your business capacity, or would you prefer a more conservative target around 5,000 customers, which would give you some buffer room at $50 per customer?

TURN 7 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Wow, 7,000 new customers sounds amazing! That would be huge for us. I think we could handle that many new customers - our fulfillment can scale up and we have the inventory. Maybe let's go with the 5,000 target though, since that still sounds like a massive win and gives us some breathing room like you said. I'd rather hit our target for sure than stretch too thin and miss it.

AGENT:
Smart thinking! 5,000 new customers with your $250K budget gives you a solid efficiency target:

$250,000 ÷ 5,000 = $50 per customer

That's conservative for footwear and builds in buffer for optimization. This efficiency is very achievable based on industry benchmarks, so you're setting yourself up for success.

Perfect - we've nailed down your foundation: 5,000 new customers at $50 per customer with your $250K budget. Now let's define who these customers should be.

Who is your ideal customer for StepRight Shoes? Think about demographics like age, gender, income level, or lifestyle - whoever is most likely to buy and become a repeat customer.
