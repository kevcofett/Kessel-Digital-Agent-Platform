# Media Plan Output: Sophisticated User - IDK Protocol

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

$500K / 10,000 = $50 per user acquisition. That's aggressive but achievable for fintech with tight execution.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 10,000 new users - is this about transaction volume, revenue growth, or market expansion?

Turn 2:
Perfect. Revenue growth with acquisition efficiency proof for Series B - that's a clear dual objective.

For your primary success metric, what number will you track? Since remittance users generate revenue through transaction volume, are you measuring total transaction value, revenue generated, or something else as your main KPI for this campaign?

Turn 3:
Excellent - $2-3M transaction volume in 90 days from 10K users means $200-300 per user in early transaction volume. That shows strong activation and usage patterns.

Let me model the economics: At $50 acquisition cost and assuming a 2.5% take rate (typical for remittance), each user generating $250 in transactions would produce ~$6.25 in revenue in 90 days. 

That's a 12.5% return in the first quarter, which is quite aggressive for immediate payback. What's the lifetime transaction volume you typically see from active remittance users, or do you have data on user economics after the first 90 days?

Turn 5:
Exactly right thinking. Let me run the math:

$2.5M target ÷ $250 per active user = 10,000 active users needed
10,000 active users ÷ 65% activation rate = 15,385 total acquisitions

So yes, approximately 15,400 users to hit your $2.5M transaction volume target.

15,400 users × $50 CAC = $770K total budget required

This creates a decision point: you can hit your transaction volume goal with a $270K budget increase, or optimize the $500K budget for maximum efficiency and accept $1.6M transaction volume from 10K acquisitions.

Given your Series B timing, which is more important - hitting the specific transaction volume number, or proving you can acquire efficiently at the $50 CAC level?

Turn 6:
Perfect decision. Proving sustainable unit economics at scale is exactly what Series B investors want to see. $50 CAC with strong activation shows you've built a repeatable growth engine.

Your plan: $500K budget → 10K acquisitions → 6,500 active users → $1.6M transaction volume in 90 days. That's solid proof of concept for scalability.

Now let's define your target audience. Remittance users typically have specific demographic and behavioral patterns. Who is your ideal customer - are you targeting specific immigrant communities, income levels, sending corridors, or frequency patterns? The tighter we define this, the more efficient that $50 CAC becomes.

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using $1,000 annual transaction volume per active user based on remittance industry benchmarks for platforms like yours. At 2.5% take rate, that projects to $25 annual revenue per user.

$50 CAC / $25 annual revenue = 2-year payback period. That's actually reasonable for fintech, though aggressive for immediate quarterly returns.

The key assumption is activation rate - not all 10K acquired users will become active transactors. Industry benchmarks suggest 60-70% activation for remittance platforms with good onboarding.

At 65% activation: 6,500 active users × $250 (90-day volume) = $1.6M transaction volume. That falls short of your $2-3M target.

To hit $2.5M in 90 days, you'd need either higher activation rates or users transacting more heavily upfront. Is your $2-3M target based on all 10K users being active, or do you have assumptions about activation rates?
