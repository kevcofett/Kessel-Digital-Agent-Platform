# Media Plan Output: High-Stakes Performance Campaign

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your business outcome. You mentioned acquiring 50,000 new merchants - is merchant acquisition the primary business outcome you're trying to achieve, or is there a broader growth objective this supports?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your primary objective is merchant acquisition to drive ARR growth and market share expansion in mid-market. 

Now for measurement - how do you want to define success numerically? Is it the 50,000 new merchants as your primary KPI, or would you prefer to track something like cost per merchant acquisition, or perhaps qualified merchant signups that convert to active accounts?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - you've done the math perfectly. $2M ÷ 50,000 = $40 per merchant, and 50,000 ÷ 0.65 = 77,000 signups needed.

Now let's check if this efficiency is realistic. With $850 merchant LTV and $40 acquisition cost, that's a 21.25x LTV/CAC ratio - which is exceptionally strong for B2B. 

However, I need to assess the market reality. For fintech B2B acquisition, typical CPAs range from $150-400 based on complexity and competition. Your $40 target is quite aggressive.

Is this $40 based on blended performance across all channels, or are you seeing specific channels already delivering at this efficiency? And does your $850 LTV factor in the full merchant lifecycle including processing volume growth?

Turn 5:
Smart approach - prove the model then scale. Let's target 13,000 merchants with your $2M budget. That projects to $154 CAC ($2M ÷ 13,000), which aligns well with fintech benchmarks and gives you a healthy 5.5x LTV/CAC ratio.

At 65% signup-to-active conversion, you'll need approximately 20,000 qualified signups to hit 13,000 active merchants.

This sets a solid foundation for Step 2 economics. Now let's move to Step 3 - your target audience. You mentioned focusing on mid-market merchants. Can you describe your ideal merchant profile? What size businesses, industries, or other characteristics define your best customers?

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using $850 LTV based on your cohort data - you can refine anytime. 

Let me recalibrate based on fintech B2B benchmarks. Typical merchant acquisition costs run $150-300 for established fintechs. At $200 CPA (conservative benchmark), your $2M budget would acquire 10,000 merchants, not 50,000.

To hit your 50,000 target at market rates, you'd need $7.5M-15M budget. Alternatively, to maximize your $2M efficiently, targeting 10,000-13,000 merchants would be more realistic.

Which direction makes more sense: adjust the volume target to match your budget at market rates, or identify if there's additional budget available to support the 50,000 merchant goal?

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Perfect - that's a well-defined profile. Service-based businesses with $10K-$100K monthly processing volume seeking advanced capabilities beyond basic payment processing.

For audience precision, I need a few more signals. What are the typical decision-maker roles you're targeting - is it usually the business owner, CFO, operations manager, or does it vary by company size? And geographically, are you focused on specific regions, or is this a national play?

Turn 7:
Excellent - business owners for smaller merchants, CFOs for larger ones, with operations managers as potential entry points. Major metros plus secondary markets with less competition is smart positioning.

Now for Step 4 geography. You mentioned major metros (NYC, LA, Chicago, Dallas) plus secondary markets (Austin, Denver, Nashville). 

Should we weight budget allocation toward your established metros where you have traction, or split more evenly to accelerate expansion into those secondary markets? And are there any other geographic markets you're considering, or should we focus the plan on these seven metros?

Turn 8:
Smart allocation - 70% to established metros, 30% to secondary market expansion. That's $1.4M for NYC/LA/Chicago/Dallas and $600K for Austin/Denver/Nashville testing.

At $154 target CAC, this projects to approximately 9,100 merchants from major metros and 3,900 from secondary markets.

Now for Step 5 - budget allocation. Within each geography, should we allocate evenly across your target segments (small vs medium businesses), or do you see better efficiency in one size range? And between business owners and CFO targeting, is there a meaningful difference in acquisition cost that should influence our budget split?

Turn 9:
Perfect insight. So 60% to business owners (lower CAC, faster decisions) and 40% to CFOs (higher CAC, better retention). Skewing toward smaller merchants ($10K-$50K range) for efficiency.

That gives us clear budget architecture:
- Major metros: $1.4M (840K to business owners, 560K to CFOs)  
- Secondary markets: $600K (360K to business owners, 240K to CFOs)
- Size focus: Weighted toward $10K-$50K processing volume

Now for Step 6 - your value proposition. You mentioned advanced capabilities beyond basic processing - reporting, analytics, and integrations. How do you typically position PayStream against legacy processors when talking to business owners versus CFOs? Is the messaging different for these two audiences?
