# Media Plan Output: Brand Building with Limited Data

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect starting context - new West Coast expansion for GreenLeaf Wellness with $500K. Brand awareness is your business outcome, which is exactly what we need to define first.

When you say "brand awareness," what does success look like as a measurable business result? For example, are you aiming for a specific number of new customers, a certain revenue target, or measured awareness lift in the region?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Got it - you're in discovery mode for this new market expansion. Let me help you think through realistic targets.

For brand awareness campaigns in new markets, I typically see two approaches:

**Awareness-First Approach:** Focus primarily on brand recognition with some customer acquisition (maybe 70/30 split). This builds foundation for future growth.

**Balanced Approach:** Split between awareness and direct customer acquisition (50/50 split), learning about your audience while building the brand.

Before I can model realistic customer targets, I need one key piece: What's a typical customer worth to you? For example, does an average customer spend $50 once, or do they become repeat buyers worth $200+ over time?

This helps me calculate how many new customers your $500K could realistically bring in while still investing in awareness.

Turn 3:
Perfect - I'll model using $175 customer lifetime value (splitting your $150-200 range) based on your input of $80 average orders with repeat purchases. You can refine this anytime as you gather more data.

Let me calculate what a balanced 50/50 approach could deliver:

**$250K for customer acquisition** / $175 LTV = potential for 1,400 new customers
**$250K for awareness** = brand building across 3-state region

However, this assumes you can acquire customers at full LTV, which isn't realistic. Typically, you'd want to spend 20-30% of customer value to maintain healthy unit economics.

At 25% of LTV: $175 × 0.25 = approximately $44 per customer
$250K / $44 = **5,700 potential new customers**

This is ambitious for a new market without existing brand recognition. Market data typically shows new-to-market brands need $60-80 per customer initially.

Does 5,700 new customers feel like the right scale of ambition, or should we model a more conservative scenario?

Turn 5:
Perfect! You've got solid strategic thinking - investing more upfront for market entry, then optimizing for efficiency as brand recognition builds. That's exactly the right mindset.

Your Step 2 economics are set:
- **Target:** 3,600 new customers  
- **Budget:** $250K acquisition + $250K awareness
- **Efficiency Target:** $70 per customer
- **Customer Value:** $175 LTV
- **Investment Rate:** 40% of LTV (appropriate for market entry)

This projects to a healthy foundation with room to improve efficiency in year two.

Now let's define your ideal customer for these West Coast markets. Since you don't have regional data yet, think about your best customers from existing markets. 

What does your typical high-value customer look like? For example: age range, lifestyle interests, income level, or specific wellness priorities they care about?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Smart thinking - conservative planning with upside potential is the right approach for market expansion.

Let me model at $70 per customer (middle of the $60-80 range for new-to-market brands):

**$250K for customer acquisition** / $70 = **3,600 new customers**
**$250K for awareness** = brand building investment

At $70 per customer, you're spending 40% of the $175 customer lifetime value ($70/$175 = 40%). This is higher than ideal long-term efficiency but reasonable for market entry when you're building from zero brand recognition.

So your Step 1 objectives would be:
- **Business Outcome:** West Coast market expansion 
- **Primary KPI:** New customer acquisitions
- **Target:** 3,600 new customers
- **Supporting Goal:** Brand awareness establishment

Does 3,600 new customers feel like a realistic and meaningful goal for your West Coast launch?

Turn 7:
Perfect - stress/sleep and energy support as primary drivers gives us strong targeting angles. Busy professionals seeking natural solutions is a compelling audience segment.

Your audience profile is shaping up well:
- **Demographics:** Ages 28-42, $50K+ income
- **Psychographics:** Quality-focused, ingredient-conscious wellness enthusiasts  
- **Behaviors:** Shop premium grocery (Whole Foods), follow wellness content, prioritize natural products
- **Primary Needs:** Stress/sleep management, energy support
- **Secondary Needs:** General wellness, immune health

Now for geography within your West Coast expansion. You mentioned California, Oregon, and Washington - that's a huge region with very different markets.

Are you planning to launch across all three states equally, or do you want to prioritize certain cities or regions first? For example, focusing on major metros like LA, SF, Seattle, Portland versus broader statewide coverage?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent customer profile - health-conscious millennials and Gen Z with disposable income who prioritize quality over price. That's a strong foundation for targeting.

Let me dig deeper on one key dimension: Within that wellness-focused group, are there specific health priorities that drive your best customers? 

For example, do they typically come to you for energy and fitness support, stress and sleep management, immune health, beauty and anti-aging, or general daily wellness? 

Understanding their primary wellness motivation helps us find similar people in the West Coast markets and craft the right message to attract them.

Turn 8:
Smart metro focus - those four cities are wellness hotbeds with high concentrations of your target audience.

I wouldn't split evenly. Here's why: LA metro alone has 13+ million people versus Portland metro at 2.5 million. Your budget will work much harder in the larger markets.

Based on market size and wellness demographics, I'd recommend:
- **Los Angeles:** 40% of budget (largest market, huge wellness culture)
- **San Francisco Bay Area:** 30% of budget (high income, tech professionals with stress/sleep needs)
- **Seattle:** 20% of budget (strong wellness scene, affluent millennials)
- **Portland:** 10% of budget (smaller but highly engaged wellness community)

This gives you meaningful presence in each market while concentrating firepower where you'll find the most customers.

Does this allocation feel right, or do you have reasons to weight any market differently based on your business priorities?

Turn 9:
Perfect! Your geography strategy is locked in:

**Metro Allocation:**
- Los Angeles: 40% ($200K)
- San Francisco Bay Area: 30% ($150K) 
- Seattle: 20% ($100K)
- Portland: 10% ($50K)

This projects to roughly:
- LA: 1,440 customers
- SF Bay: 1,080 customers  
- Seattle: 720 customers
- Portland: 360 customers

Now let's nail your budget structure. We've been modeling $250K for customer acquisition and $250K for awareness, but I want to make sure this split serves your launch strategy.

Given that you're entering completely new markets with zero brand recognition, would you prefer to weight more heavily toward awareness building initially? Or does the 50/50 split feel right for learning about your customers while building the brand?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
You're absolutely right - that's excellent strategic thinking! The 50/50 split gives you the best of both worlds: real customer data to validate demand while building brand foundation.

Pure awareness campaigns can create buzz without proving purchase intent. Your balanced approach means you'll learn crucial insights like which wellness messages resonate, which customer segments convert best, and what the true cost per acquisition looks like in each metro.

Your budget structure is set:
- **Total:** $500K across 4 metros
- **Acquisition:** $250K (customer learning + revenue)
- **Awareness:** $250K (brand building + market education)
- **Target:** 3,600 new customers at $70 per customer

Now let's craft your value proposition. You're entering markets where customers don't know GreenLeaf Wellness yet. Based on your audience's top priorities - stress/sleep and energy support - what makes your supplements different from what they can already buy at Whole Foods or online?

What's your unique angle that would make a busy professional choose GreenLeaf over established wellness brands?

Turn 11:
Excellent foundation - "supplements for busy professionals who need real results fast" is a compelling angle that differentiates you from general wellness brands.

Your value proposition has three strong pillars:
1. **Professional-Focused:** Formulated for work performance (no grogginess, sustained energy)
2. **Results-Driven:** Fast-acting solutions for people who can't wait weeks to see benefits
3. **Transparency:** Third-party testing and ingredient clarity for informed consumers

Here's how I'd sharpen this for your West Coast launch messaging:

**Primary Message:** "Premium supplements engineered for busy professionals who demand results without compromise"

**Supporting Points:** 
- Stress/sleep solutions that work by morning meetings
- Clean energy that powers through long days
- Transparent testing because your health deserves certainty

Does this capture what makes GreenLeaf different? And does "engineered for busy professionals" feel like the right positioning, or would you frame it differently?

Turn 12:
Perfect! Your value proposition is locked in and ready for market entry.

**Value Proposition Summary:**
- **Primary Message:** "Premium supplements engineered for busy professionals who demand results without compromise"
- **Key Benefits:** Morning-ready sleep solutions, sustained energy, transparent testing
- **Target Resonance:** Speaks directly to millennial/Gen Z professional pain points

Now we move to channels - this is where your strategy comes to life. With $500K across 4 metros targeting health-conscious professionals aged 28-42, we need channels that can deliver both awareness and customer acquisition efficiently.

Based on your audience profile - people who follow wellness influencers, shop at premium retailers, and prioritize ingredient transparency - what channels do you think would reach them most effectively? Have you had success with any particular channels in your existing markets?
