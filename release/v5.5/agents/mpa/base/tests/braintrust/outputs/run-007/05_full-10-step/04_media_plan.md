# Media Plan Output: Full 10-Step Media Planning

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your business outcome. You mentioned acquiring 15,000 new customers - is customer acquisition your primary business objective, or are you also focused on revenue growth, brand awareness, or retention alongside new customer acquisition?

Turn 2:
Perfect. Customer acquisition as your primary objective with brand awareness as a supporting goal gives us clear direction. 

Now I need to understand how you'll measure success. What's your primary KPI - the main number you'll track to know if this campaign succeeded? For example, are you measuring total new customers acquired, cost per customer acquisition, or something else?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent! $750K ÷ 15,000 = $50 per customer - that's your target efficiency. This is actually quite achievable for home decor ecommerce based on typical benchmarks.

Before we assess if $50 per customer is realistic, I need to understand your customer economics. What's the average order value for a new customer, and do customers typically make repeat purchases? This helps us determine if $50 acquisition cost makes financial sense for your business.

Turn 4:
Great! Let me model your customer economics:

First purchase: $180 × 35% margin = $63 profit
40% repeat at $220 × 35% = $77 additional profit
Average customer lifetime value = $63 + ($77 × 0.4) = $94

At $50 acquisition cost, your LTV/CAC ratio = $94 ÷ $50 = 1.9x. This is on the conservative side - healthy ratios are typically 3x+ for sustainable growth. However, your $50 target is definitely achievable in home decor, where benchmarks typically range from $35-65 per customer.

To hit your ambitious volume target of 15,000 customers, we'll need precise audience targeting and efficient channel selection. Your economics work, but there's not much room for waste.

Ready to move to Step 3 and define your target audience?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Perfect! You're right that LTV often grows beyond the first year - we can refine that as you gather more data.

Now let's define your target audience with precision. Since we need tight efficiency to hit 15,000 customers at $50 each, every audience signal matters.

Let's start with demographics. What can you tell me about your typical customers - age ranges, household income, gender split, and any other demographic patterns you've noticed?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent demographic foundation! Women 30-55, $60K-120K household income, 75% female split - that's a well-defined core audience.

Now let's dig into behaviors and interests that will help us find more of these customers. Beyond the home decor interest, what other behaviors or life moments do you notice? For example, do they follow specific design influencers, shop at particular retailers, engage with home improvement content, or show other lifestyle patterns that could help us identify similar prospects?

Turn 7:
Perfect! Those behavioral signals paint a clear picture of engaged home design enthusiasts. Pinterest and Instagram traffic, interior design influencer following, DIY interest, and active participation in Facebook home decorating groups - these are excellent targeting signals.

One more audience dimension: are there any life stage triggers or seasonal patterns you've noticed? For example, do you see spikes around moving season, holidays, or specific life events? And have you noticed any geographic patterns - certain regions, urban vs suburban, or specific metro areas that over-index for your brand?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Perfect! Austin, Dallas, Boston suburbs, and Philadelphia suburbs are excellent test markets - they align well with your customer demographics and suburban homeowner focus.

$750K ÷ 15,000 customers = $50 per customer across all markets. With 60% to proven markets and 40% to expansion:

Proven markets: $450K targeting 9,000 customers
Expansion markets: $300K targeting 6,000 customers  

This gives us meaningful test budgets while protecting your core volume. The expansion markets might require slightly higher acquisition costs initially due to lower brand awareness, but the market characteristics suggest they should perform well once optimized.

Ready to move to Step 5 and determine your budget allocation strategy - how we'll distribute that investment across markets, seasons, and campaign types?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
Excellent insights! Spring/fall redecorating cycles, holiday hosting preparation, suburban/mid-sized cities, with West Coast and Southeast strength - these patterns will be crucial for our geography and timing strategy.

Your audience definition is solid: women 30-55, $60K-120K income, suburban homeowners, Pinterest/Instagram active, following design influencers, shopping Target/West Elm/Wayfair, engaged in DIY and Facebook home groups, with seasonal redecorating patterns.

This gives us strong targeting precision for your $50 efficiency target. Ready to move to Step 4 and get specific about your geographic priorities and any market expansion opportunities?

Turn 9:
Smart approach! Let me analyze your successful markets and model expansion opportunities.

Your current strongholds - West Coast and Southeast - share key characteristics: high homeownership rates, suburban growth, and strong home improvement spending. California, Washington, Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas are excellent foundations.

For expansion, Texas is a natural fit - similar suburban homeowner demographics, strong household incomes in metros like Austin, Dallas, and Houston. The Northeast metros (particularly suburbs around Boston, Philadelphia, and DC) also match your customer profile well.

Given your $750K budget targeting 15,000 customers, I'd recommend this geographic allocation approach: 60% in your proven markets for reliable volume, 40% in expansion markets to test and scale.

Which specific metros or states would you prioritize within Texas and the Northeast for testing? And do you have any existing brand awareness or shipping advantages in certain regions?

Turn 11:
Excellent! Let's map your budget to seasonal performance and market strategy.

Based on your spring/fall strength plus holiday hosting bump, I'd recommend this seasonal allocation:

Spring (Mar-May): 35% = $262K
Fall (Sep-Nov): 35% = $262K  
Holiday (Nov-Dec): 20% = $150K
Summer/Winter maintenance: 10% = $76K

Within each season, we'd apply your 60/40 geographic split. This concentrates firepower during peak redecorating periods while maintaining year-round presence.

For expansion markets, I'd suggest launching in spring when purchase intent is highest - this gives new markets the best chance to prove viability before we commit fall budgets.

Does this seasonal weighting align with your sales patterns? And would you prefer a more aggressive approach in any particular season?

Turn 12:
Great thinking! Fall is indeed your absolute peak, and we can definitely adjust if spring expansion tests show strong results.

Here's how that could work: if expansion markets prove viable in spring (hitting that $50 efficiency target), we could shift 5% more budget to fall, making it 40% vs 35% spring. That would give us $300K for fall when performance peaks.

Now let's move to Step 6 - your value proposition. With tight $50 efficiency targets and expansion into new markets, your messaging needs to work hard. 

What's your core value proposition that differentiates HomeStyle Decor? For example, is it product quality, unique style, pricing, customer service, or something else that makes customers choose you over Target, West Elm, or Wayfair?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 13:
Perfect! "Designer-quality pieces at accessible prices" with curated, cohesive collections - that's a compelling position between mass market and premium.

Your value proposition directly addresses two major pain points: budget constraints ("expensive look for less") and decision fatigue ("curated vs overwhelming"). This messaging should resonate strongly with your 30-55, $60K-120K audience who want style but are price-conscious.

For your expansion markets where you're building awareness from zero, leading with "designer look, accessible price" will be crucial since you're competing against established players on value, not just brand recognition.

Ready for Step 7 - channel strategy? With your visual audience (Pinterest/Instagram active), suburban geography, and $50 efficiency target, we'll need to select channels that can deliver both reach and precision. This is where your tight targeting really pays off.

Turn 14:
Excellent! Your organic Pinterest/Instagram success gives us proven audience-channel fit. Let me recommend a channel mix optimized for your $50 efficiency target:

**Primary Channels (70% of budget):**
- Meta (Facebook/Instagram): 40% - Perfect for your suburban women 30-55, visual products, and home decorating group engagement
- Pinterest: 20% - Already working organically, highly efficient for home decor with strong purchase intent
- Google Search: 10% - Capture high-intent "home decor" and competitor searches

**Secondary Channels (30% of budget):**
- YouTube: 15% - Target DIY/home improvement content viewers
- Google Shopping: 10% - Visual product showcase for furniture searches  
- Connected TV: 5% - Brand building in suburban markets, especially expansion areas

This mix leverages your visual products and proven audience behaviors. Meta and Pinterest should hit your $50 target reliably, while Google captures bottom-funnel intent.

Does this channel allocation align with your expectations, or would you adjust any percentages?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 10: Risks

Turn 15:
Great instinct! Shifting more budget to Google Shopping makes sense - visual product showcase drives direct conversions while Connected TV is more brand-building focused.

Let's adjust to:
- Google Shopping: 15% (up from 10%)
- Connected TV: 0% (reallocate for efficiency focus)

This gives us a performance-optimized mix that should hit your $50 target more reliably while still maintaining brand building through YouTube.

Now for Step 8 - measurement. With your $50 efficiency target and multiple channels, we need solid attribution. Beyond your primary KPI of total customers acquired, what measurement capabilities do you currently have? For example, can you track customers back to specific channels, and do you have tools like Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, or first-party data tracking set up?
