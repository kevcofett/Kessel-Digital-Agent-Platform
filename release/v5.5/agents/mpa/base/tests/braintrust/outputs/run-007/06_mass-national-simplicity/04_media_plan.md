# Media Plan Output: Mass National Campaign - Simplicity Test

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've shared great context - national snack launch with $8M for brand awareness among adults 18-54. Before we dive into reach planning, I need to understand your specific business outcome.

What business result are you trying to achieve with this awareness campaign? For example, are you aiming to drive trial purchases, increase consideration for future purchases, or establish market presence before retail expansion?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect! Trial purchases and consideration building for retail launch - that's a clear business outcome. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success as a number.

You mentioned brand lift studies for measurement. What specific metric will tell you this campaign succeeded? For example, are you targeting a specific number of people to try the product, a percentage increase in brand awareness, or aided/unaided recall targets?

Turn 3:
Excellent - 15-20% unaided awareness increase is your primary success metric, with supporting goals of 45% aided awareness and 10-point purchase intent lift. Those are ambitious but achievable targets for a new brand launch.

Now I need one more piece to complete our outcomes framework. Among your target audience of adults 18-54, how many people do you need to reach to hit that 15-20% unaided awareness lift? 

For context, if we estimate roughly 140 million adults 18-54 in the US, are you thinking you need to reach the full universe, or would reaching say 50-60 million people effectively build the awareness you need?

Turn 4:
Got it! 80-100 million reach target with your $8M budget. Let me run the efficiency math to see if this is realistic.

$8M / 90M people (midpoint) = approximately $89 per person reached

That's quite high for awareness campaigns, which typically run $5-15 per person reached through mass media channels. Your target suggests either very high frequency or premium media costs.

For context, brand awareness campaigns usually need 3-5+ exposures per person to drive meaningful lift. At $89 per person, you'd be limited to premium placements or very high frequency to smaller audiences.

Is your expectation that this $89 per person includes multiple exposures, or should we recalibrate either the reach target or budget to hit more realistic efficiency levels?

Turn 5:
Perfect, let me model realistic reach at proper frequency levels.

For effective awareness building, you need 3-5 exposures per person. Using mass media channels (TV, digital video, audio), typical costs run:

$8M / $10 per person (including 3-4 exposures) = 800,000 people reached
$8M / $7 per person (more efficient mix) = ~1.1M people reached  

But 1M people is far below your 80-100M target. This suggests we need to reassess either:
1) Budget expectations - reaching 80M people effectively might need $25-40M
2) Reach targets - focusing on 15-20M high-value prospects instead of mass reach
3) Strategy - phased launch starting with key markets rather than full national

Given you're launching in major retail chains nationwide, which direction feels right? Should we explore a more targeted approach to maximize impact within your $8M, or does this analysis suggest the budget needs to increase significantly?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent strategic thinking! Focusing on 15-20M high-value prospects is much more realistic and often drives better ROI than spreading thin across mass market.

$8M / 15-20M people = $400-530 per thousand people reached, which aligns well with premium audience targeting and effective frequency.

This approach also sets you up perfectly for retail success - concentrated awareness among your most likely buyers creates stronger in-store conversion when they encounter your products.

Now that we have realistic outcomes and economics locked in, let's move to Step 3: Audience definition. You mentioned heavy snack buyers and people likely to try new products. 

What other characteristics define your ideal snack customer beyond the 18-54 age range? For example, household income, lifestyle behaviors, shopping patterns, or attitudes toward food and snacking?

Turn 7:
Perfect audience definition! Premium positioning at $50K+ income, targeting convenience-seeking professionals and parents who value better-for-you options. The Target/Whole Foods shopping behavior and early adopter mindset are excellent targeting signals.

Let me size this audience: Adults 18-54 with $50K+ household income who shop premium grocery and exhibit early adopter behaviors represents roughly 25-30 million people nationally. Your 15-20M target fits well within this universe, giving us room to prioritize the highest-propensity segments.

One key question for targeting precision: Among busy professionals versus parents with kids at home, do you have a preference? Both value convenience, but their snacking occasions and purchase drivers differ significantly. Parents focus on family-friendly options, while professionals prioritize portable, workplace-appropriate snacks.

Should we weight toward one group, or target both equally?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Smart strategic thinking! The 70/30 split toward parents makes perfect sense - they're the household purchase decision makers and your better-for-you positioning resonates strongly with parents seeking family-friendly options they feel good about.

This weighting also maximizes household penetration since parents buy for multiple family members, giving you more volume per converted household than individual professionals.

With this 70/30 parent-professional split within your premium audience, we're looking at approximately:
- 10-14M parents (household income $50K+, kids at home)  
- 3-6M busy professionals (household income $50K+, early adopters)

This audience definition sets us up perfectly for Step 4: Geography. Since you're launching in major retail chains nationally, should we weight media investment toward markets with higher concentrations of your target families, or do you need relatively even coverage to support consistent retail availability across all markets?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Excellent geographic strategy! Concentrating investment in high-propensity suburban markets around major cities maximizes efficiency and creates proof points for expansion. This focused approach should deliver stronger brand lift results than thin national coverage.

Key suburban markets with high concentrations of $50K+ families typically include areas around NYC, Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta, Denver, and West Coast metros. These markets also tend to have strong retail presence for Target and Whole Foods.

For Step 5, let's allocate your $8M budget. With your concentrated geographic approach and 15-20M reach target among premium families, how do you want to think about budget allocation?

Should we weight heavily toward your top 10-15 metro areas where audience concentration is highest, or do you have specific markets you know are strategic priorities for retail performance?

Turn 10:
Perfect allocation strategy! 70-80% to top metros with 20-30% for secondary market testing gives you concentrated impact plus expansion insights.

Budget allocation breakdown:
- $5.6-6.4M to top 10-15 metros (NYC, Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta, Denver, West Coast)
- $1.6-2.4M to secondary markets for testing

This concentration should deliver strong frequency among your premium families while providing data on broader market potential.

Moving to Step 6: Value Proposition. You've mentioned better-for-you snacks with cleaner ingredients that taste great and appeal to both kids and parents. 

What's your key differentiator that will make busy parents choose FreshBite over established snack brands? Is it specific ingredients you avoid, nutrition benefits you offer, or something else that makes parents feel confident about their choice?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 11:
Excellent value proposition! "Real ingredients kids love, parents approve" hits the perfect sweet spot. The taste-without-compromise angle differentiates you from cardboard-tasting healthy options, while clean ingredients appeal to parent guilt around snacking.

Your messaging framework is clear:
- Functional: Real, pronounceable ingredients + baked not fried
- Emotional: Parents feel good saying yes
- Proof: Kids actually ask for them

This positions FreshBite as the guilt-free indulgence that solves the parent dilemma of nutrition vs. taste.

Now for Step 7: Channels. With your $5.6-6.4M concentrated in top metros targeting premium families, we need channels that efficiently reach parents with kids at strong frequency levels.

Based on your audience and objectives, which media environment feels most important: reaching parents during family time (like connected TV), during their personal time (social media), or throughout their day (audio/podcast during commutes and errands)?
