# Media Plan Output: Precision Targeting with Complex Attributes

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Your brief shows sophisticated targeting - HNW acquisition with $1.5M budget for 2,500 qualified leads. That implies $600 per qualified lead, which is reasonable for wealth management given typical conversion rates and client values.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 2,500 qualified leads? For example, are you targeting a specific number of new AUM clients, or a revenue target from conversions?

Turn 2:
Perfect. $1.5M budget targeting 275 new AUM clients (splitting your 250-300 range) equals $5,455 per client acquisition. With $75-100M AUM target, that's approximately $300K average client size generating $3K annual fees.

$5,455 CAC against $3K annual revenue gives you an 18-month payback, which is aggressive but achievable for wealth management given typical client retention rates of 5+ years.

How do you currently measure a "qualified lead" - what specific criteria make an MQL qualified for your sales team?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Got it. Your current $7K-8K CAC provides helpful context. Targeting $5,455 represents a 22-30% efficiency improvement - ambitious but not unrealistic with precision targeting and first-party data leverage.

Let me remodel: If you hit $6,500 CAC (middle of your comfort range), that's $1.79M total cost for 275 clients, requiring a $290K budget increase. At $7K CAC, you'd need $1.925M total budget.

$1.5M budget / $6,500 realistic CAC = 231 clients, which still delivers $69M+ AUM and strong ROI.

Given this efficiency reality, would you prefer to adjust expectations to ~230 clients within budget, or should we plan for potential budget flexibility to hit your 275 client target?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - your MQL definition is precise with asset verification and intent signals. That stringent qualification supports the $600 per MQL efficiency.

Let me model your unit economics: $5,455 CAC with 18-month payback assumes strong client retention. In wealth management, clients typically stay 7-10 years, projecting $21K-30K lifetime value per client. That gives you a healthy 4-5x LTV/CAC ratio.

Your target is ambitious but achievable given the HNW market and your first-party data advantage from 50K existing clients for lookalike modeling.

Is this $5,455 per client acquisition realistic based on your current performance, or does this represent a stretch efficiency target?

Turn 5:
Perfect - 230 clients at $6,500 CAC within your $1.5M budget is a realistic foundation. $69M AUM generating $690K annual revenue gives you strong ROI, and any efficiency gains become pure upside.

Your economics are solid: $6,500 CAC with 8-9 year retention projects $24K-27K LTV, maintaining that healthy 4x+ ratio. The precision targeting approach with your 50K client lookalike data should help drive toward the lower end of your CAC range.

Now let's define your high-value audience precisely. You mentioned $1M+ investable assets, ages 45-65, executives and business owners with specific life events. 

How narrow do you want to get with the executive/business owner criteria - are you targeting C-suite at specific company sizes, or including successful professionals like partners at law firms, medical practices, etc.?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 7:
Perfect - your 1-2% current performance validates the targeting approach, and planning conservatively at 0.6-1.25% builds in good safety margin. The lookalike modeling from your 50K client CRM should help identify the highest-propensity prospects within that universe.

Now let's map your 10 target DMAs by HNW concentration. You mentioned NYC, SF, LA, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Denver, Miami, Dallas, DC - all strong wealth centers.

Do you have any preference for geographic allocation, or should we weight spend by HNW population density? For example, NYC and SF typically have the highest concentrations of your target profile, while markets like Denver and Miami might offer better efficiency with less competition.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent - that broader professional definition gives you significant scale while maintaining sophistication. Business owners at $5M-50M revenue and professionals earning $500K+ creates a substantial addressable market in your target DMAs.

The "sophisticated but busy" insight is crucial for messaging - they understand complexity but need execution support.

Let me check your audience sizing: In your 10 target DMAs (NYC, SF, LA, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Denver, Miami, Dallas, DC), you're looking at roughly 2-3M households with $1M+ investable assets. Your behavioral filters (tax optimization, estate planning intent) plus professional criteria should narrow this to a targetable universe of approximately 200K-400K individuals.

Given your 2,500 MQL target from this universe, you're looking at roughly 0.6-1.25% conversion rate from audience to MQL. Does this penetration rate align with your expectations?

Turn 9:
Excellent data - your geographic CAC spread validates the allocation strategy perfectly. Let me model this:

**High-cost markets (55% of budget):**
- NYC $375K at $9K CAC = 42 clients  
- SF $300K at $8.5K CAC = 35 clients
- LA $225K at $7.5K CAC = 30 clients

**Efficient markets (45% of budget):**
- Seattle $100K at $6K CAC = 17 clients
- Denver $100K at $6K CAC = 17 clients  
- Miami $100K at $6K CAC = 17 clients
- Others $375K at $7K average = 54 clients

**Total projection: 212 clients at $6,615 blended CAC**

This gets you close to your 230 target with room for optimization upside. The 45% allocation to efficient markets helps offset the coastal premium while maintaining necessary presence in your highest-opportunity DMAs.

Should we model any seasonal adjustments to this geographic allocation, or maintain consistent presence year-round?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Smart allocation strategy - concentrating 45% in NYC/SF for scale while overweighting emerging wealth centers like Seattle, Denver, and Miami for efficiency gains.

Your suggested allocation: NYC 25% ($375K), SF 20% ($300K), LA 15% ($225K), with remaining $600K across seven markets. That gives roughly $85K per secondary market, with your overweights to Seattle/Denver/Miami pushing those to ~$100K each.

This approach balances opportunity size with competitive dynamics. The tech wealth migration to Seattle/Denver and finance relocation to Miami creates underserved HNW populations - exactly where precision targeting pays off.

Your $1.5M budget across these 10 DMAs should give you meaningful presence in each market while concentrating firepower where it matters most.

What's your current understanding of client acquisition costs by geography - do you see meaningful CAC differences between primary markets like NYC/SF versus emerging markets like Denver/Seattle?

Turn 10:
Perfect seasonal weighting - front-loading Q4/Q1 when tax planning urgency peaks makes complete sense for wealth management. Your 35%/30%/20%/15% allocation aligns with natural HNW decision cycles.

**Seasonal budget allocation:**
- Q4: $525K (35%) - peak tax optimization urgency
- Q1: $450K (30%) - financial resolutions and planning  
- Q2: $300K (20%) - maintain presence during slower period
- Q3: $225K (15%) - minimal spend during vacation season

This seasonal approach should improve efficiency beyond your $6,615 blended CAC projection since you're concentrating spend when intent is highest.

Now let's define your value proposition. You mentioned tax optimization and estate planning as key intent signals. How do you differentiate LuxeFinance from the dozens of other wealth managers targeting the same HNW audience with similar services?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Excellent positioning - the "quarterback" role solving coordination complexity is a strong differentiator. Most HNW individuals have fragmented advisory relationships, and you're solving the orchestration problem.

Your three pillars create clear competitive separation:
1. **Specialist focus**: Complex tax strategies vs. generalist approach
2. **Coordination model**: Working WITH existing advisors vs. replacing them  
3. **Sweet spot sizing**: $1M-25M exclusive focus vs. chasing bigger fish

The "senior advisor attention" message should resonate strongly with your target - they've likely experienced being handed off to junior staff at larger firms.

For messaging hierarchy, which of these three differentiators tends to be the strongest hook in your current successful campaigns? Is it the specialist tax expertise, the coordination approach, or the focused service model that gets prospects to engage first?

Turn 12:
Perfect insight - leading with coordination pain point as the primary hook makes total sense. "Stop playing telephone between your advisors" immediately identifies the daily frustration your prospects face.

Your messaging hierarchy is smart:
1. **Primary hook**: Coordination/quarterback role (year-round relevance)
2. **Secondary amplifier**: Tax expertise (seasonal urgency boost)  
3. **Retention differentiator**: Focused service model (post-acquisition value)

The advisor diagram visual is brilliant - instantly communicates the solution without explanation. Visual metaphors work exceptionally well for complex financial concepts.

For your $1.5M budget and precision targeting approach, we should build creative variations around this coordination theme with seasonal tax expertise overlays for Q4/Q1 flights.

Now let's move to channels. Given your HNW audience, sophisticated messaging needs, and $6,615 CAC target, which channels are you currently using and what's working best for client acquisition?
