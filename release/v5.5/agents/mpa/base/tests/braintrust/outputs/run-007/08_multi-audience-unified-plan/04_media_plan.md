# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience Unified Media Plan

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've provided excellent segment detail - that's exactly what we need for Step 3. But first, let's nail down your success definition.

25,000 new enrollees is your volume target. What's the primary business outcome you're driving toward - is this about hitting annual enrollment targets, expanding market share in specific regions, or something else?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect - annual enrollment targets with strategic market share expansion in urban metros. That gives us clear direction.

Now for the success measurement: What's your primary KPI for tracking progress? Are you measuring total enrollees, enrollment rate by segment, market share percentage, or something else as your main success metric?

Turn 4:
Smart to recalibrate. Let's model this with realistic efficiency targets.

Using industry benchmarks:
- Young professionals: ~$200 CAC (competitive digital market)
- Families: ~$250 CAC (higher consideration, more complex decision)
- Pre-Medicare: ~$300 CAC (risk-averse, network-focused segment)

Your unit economics look strong:
- Young professionals: $3,200 premium ÷ $200 CAC = 16x ratio
- Families: $8,500 ÷ $250 = 34x ratio  
- Pre-Medicare: $6,800 ÷ $300 = 23x ratio

At $3M budget with these realistic CACs, you're looking at approximately 13,000-14,000 total enrollees rather than 25,000.

Would you prefer to adjust the enrollment target to this more achievable range, or increase budget to maintain the 25,000 goal?

Turn 5:
Perfect - 13,500 enrollees (splitting the middle) at $3M budget gives us a realistic foundation to build on. The conservative approach will definitely strengthen your case for increased investment next year.

Now let's dive into your audience strategy. You've outlined three distinct segments with different needs and behaviors. 

Looking at the competitive pressure from digital-first insurers in urban metros, how would you prioritize these three segments? Should we weight the young professionals segment more heavily given the market share defense objective, or maintain equal focus across all three?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Excellent - total enrollees as primary KPI with segment breakdowns and market share tracking for urban metros. That gives us solid measurement framework.

Now let's check if your efficiency target is realistic. With $3M budget and 25,000 enrollees, that's $3M ÷ 25,000 = $120 per enrollee acquisition cost.

For health insurance, that's quite aggressive. Industry benchmarks typically show $200-400 CAC depending on plan type and market competition. Your $120 target suggests you'll need very tight audience targeting and efficient channel selection.

What's the average annual premium value for a new enrollee across your segments? This helps us assess if the $120 CAC works with your unit economics.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent prioritization. That 40/35/25 split aligns perfectly with your competitive defense strategy while maintaining strength in your core family segment.

Let me calculate the segment allocation:
- Young professionals: $1.2M budget → ~6,000 enrollees at $200 CAC
- Families: $1.05M budget → ~4,200 enrollees at $250 CAC  
- Pre-Medicare: $750K budget → ~2,500 enrollees at $300 CAC

Total projects to ~12,700 enrollees, slightly under our 13,500 target but within range.

For the young professionals segment specifically, within those urban metros (NYC, SF, LA, Chicago), are there particular neighborhoods, zip codes, or demographic concentrations where you've seen stronger performance historically?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Perfect targeting insights. Tech workers and healthcare professionals in those specific neighborhoods give us precise geographic focus within the broader urban metros.

The proximity to major hospital systems is smart - those audiences have higher insurance literacy and appreciate network quality, which should help with conversion rates.

For your families segment, you mentioned suburban markets around top 50 metros. Are there specific suburban characteristics that perform better - certain income brackets, school district ratings, or distance from metro centers? This will help us get more precise than just "suburban."

Turn 8:
Excellent - that $75K-$150K household income band with high-rated school districts in the 15-30 mile suburban ring gives us very actionable targeting parameters. The newer developments angle is particularly smart since those families are actively making insurance decisions.

For your pre-Medicare segment, you mentioned FL, AZ, TX concentration. Within those states, are there specific metro areas, retirement communities, or demographic patterns that have worked well? For example, are you seeing better performance in active adult communities versus traditional neighborhoods?

Turn 9:
Perfect - active adult communities and early retirement relocation areas give us precise targeting. Those life transition moments create natural insurance shopping behavior.

Now let's move to geography. You've given great audience insights, but I need to understand your geographic constraints.

Are you licensed to sell in all states, or do you have specific state limitations? This affects whether we can target all the metros you mentioned and how we approach the national pre-Medicare strategy.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Great - 35 state coverage including all your priority markets gives us solid geographic reach without compliance complications.

Now for budget allocation. Based on your 40/35/25 segment priority and geographic spread, how would you want to distribute that geographically?

For example, should the young professional budget focus heavily on the 4 key metros you mentioned, or spread wider? And for families, are there particular metro suburban rings that deserve more investment than others?
