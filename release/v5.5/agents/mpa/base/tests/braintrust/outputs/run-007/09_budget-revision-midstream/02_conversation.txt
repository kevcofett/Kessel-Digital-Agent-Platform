USER:
Hi, I'm the Director of Marketing at CloudMetrics, a B2B analytics SaaS company. I need help building a media plan for next year. Our budget is $500K and we're targeting 10,000 new customers. LTV is about $2,400 per customer. Can you help?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start - you've given me strong economic foundations. $500K / 10,000 = $50 per customer acquisition cost with $2,400 LTV creates a healthy 48x LTV/CAC ratio, which is excellent for B2B SaaS.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 10,000 new customers? For example, are you focused on revenue growth, market expansion, or hitting a particular ARR milestone?

TURN 2 (Step 3)

USER:
We're primarily focused on revenue growth - we want to hit $24M in new ARR from these customers. We're also looking to expand our market presence in the mid-market segment since that's where we see the biggest opportunity. The 10,000 customers should help us establish stronger brand recognition in that space too.

AGENT:
Excellent - $24M ARR from 10,000 customers confirms your $2,400 LTV perfectly. Revenue growth with mid-market expansion gives us clear direction.

Now I need to understand how you'll measure success. What's your primary KPI - the main number you'll track to know if this campaign is working? 

For example, will you focus on new customer acquisitions, qualified leads, trial sign-ups, or something else as your key success metric?

TURN 3 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We'll definitely track new customer acquisitions as our primary KPI since that directly ties to our revenue goal. But we also want to monitor MQLs and SQLs to make sure our funnel is healthy - I'd say our secondary metrics would be qualified demo requests and trial conversions. We typically see about a 15% conversion rate from trial to paid, so we'll need to generate roughly 65,000 quality trials to hit our 10,000 customer target.

AGENT:
Perfect! New customer acquisitions as primary KPI with 10,000 target is clear. Your funnel math checks out: 65,000 trials at 15% conversion = 9,750 customers, very close to your 10,000 target.

Your $50 implied CAC is aggressive but achievable for B2B SaaS. Based on industry benchmarks, mid-market SaaS typically sees $75-150 CAC, so you're targeting the efficient end. With your strong 48x LTV/CAC ratio, you have excellent unit economics even if acquisition costs run slightly higher.

Now let's define your audience. Who is your ideal mid-market customer? What job titles, company sizes, or industries should we focus on to hit that $50 CAC efficiently?

TURN 4 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our ideal customers are typically data-driven companies between 100-1000 employees who are struggling with fragmented analytics. We primarily target Chief Data Officers, VP of Analytics, and Business Intelligence Directors - basically the people who are frustrated with their current reporting setup. 

Industries that convert best for us are tech companies, financial services, and healthcare organizations since they generate lots of data but often lack unified visibility. We've also seen good traction with manufacturing companies that are going through digital transformation initiatives.

AGENT:
Excellent targeting - data decision makers in data-rich verticals is smart positioning. Your 100-1000 employee range aligns perfectly with mid-market expansion goals.

Let me get more specific on audience sizing. Among companies with 100-1000 employees in tech, financial services, healthcare, and manufacturing, how many of the key decision makers (CDOs, VP Analytics, BI Directors) do you estimate are actively evaluating analytics solutions at any given time?

For context, this "in-market" percentage typically ranges from 3-8% in B2B SaaS depending on category maturity and pain urgency.

TURN 5 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I'd estimate around 5-6% are actively in-market at any given time. The analytics space is pretty mature now, so there's always some level of evaluation happening, especially with companies realizing their current solutions aren't scaling with their growth. 

We've noticed that pain points around data fragmentation tend to hit a breaking point when companies reach that 200-500 employee range, so they're more likely to be actively shopping for solutions. Healthcare and financial services probably skew higher due to compliance requirements driving more urgent needs.

AGENT:
Great insight - 5-6% in-market rate is realistic for mature B2B SaaS, and your observation about the 200-500 employee pain point is valuable for targeting.

Now for geography: Are you focusing on specific regions, or is this a broad market approach? Given your mid-market expansion goal and $50 CAC target, geographic concentration often improves efficiency through better audience density and localized messaging.

Where do you see the strongest opportunity for these 10,000 new customers?

TURN 6 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're primarily focused on the US and Canada for now. Within the US, we've seen the strongest performance in tech hubs like San Francisco, Seattle, Austin, and Boston, plus major business centers like New York, Chicago, and Atlanta. 

The Canadian market has been surprisingly good for us too - Toronto and Vancouver especially. We're not ready to go international beyond North America yet since we want to really dominate this market first before expanding further.

AGENT:
Smart geographic focus - North America concentration with proven high-performing metro areas will definitely support your $50 CAC target through better audience density.

Your $500K budget across 10,000 customers is mathematically sound. Now let's validate the allocation makes sense. 

Based on your trial-to-customer conversion math, you need roughly 65,000 quality trials. If we assume typical B2B SaaS trial conversion rates from paid traffic, that suggests you'll need approximately 200,000-300,000 qualified visitors to generate those trials.

Does your budget feel adequate to drive that level of qualified traffic at your target efficiency, or should we model different scenarios?

TURN 7 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Honestly, when you put it that way - needing 200,000-300,000 qualified visitors - I'm starting to wonder if $500K is enough. That's a lot of traffic to generate, especially with the quality standards we need for mid-market prospects.

I'd definitely be open to modeling different scenarios. Maybe we should look at what it would realistically cost to drive that volume of qualified traffic, or explore if there are ways to improve our funnel conversion rates to reduce the traffic requirements. What do you think would be the most realistic approach?

AGENT:
Excellent instinct - questioning the math shows strong strategic thinking. Let's model this realistically.

For B2B SaaS targeting your audience, qualified traffic typically costs $15-30 per visitor through paid channels. At the conservative end: 200,000 visitors × $20 = $4M in media spend, which is 8x your budget.

This suggests three potential paths:
1. Increase budget to match traffic requirements  
2. Improve funnel conversion rates to reduce traffic needs
3. Adjust volume targets to match budget reality

Before we dive deeper, what's more flexible - your $500K budget constraint or your 10,000 customer target? Understanding which has more room to move will help us build the most realistic plan.

TURN 8 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
The budget is definitely more flexible than the customer target. We really need those 10,000 customers to hit our revenue goals and market expansion objectives - that's pretty locked in from a business perspective.

I could probably get approval for a larger budget if I can show the ROI makes sense. Maybe we're looking at something closer to $1-1.5M? I'd need to build a strong business case, but with our LTV of $2,400, even at a higher CAC we'd still have solid unit economics. What do you think would be a realistic budget range to actually achieve 10,000 customers?

AGENT:
Smart thinking - with $2,400 LTV, you have room to increase CAC and still maintain strong unit economics.

Let me model realistic scenarios:

**Conservative Scenario:** $100 CAC
- Budget needed: 10,000 × $100 = $1M
- LTV/CAC ratio: 24x (still excellent)

**Market Reality Scenario:** $125 CAC  
- Budget needed: 10,000 × $125 = $1.25M
- LTV/CAC ratio: 19x (very strong)

Based on mid-market B2B SaaS benchmarks, $100-125 CAC is much more achievable than your original $50 target. At $1.25M budget, you're investing roughly 5% of the $24M ARR you'll generate - that's a compelling ROI story.

The $1-1.5M range you mentioned aligns perfectly with realistic market costs. Would $1.25M feel manageable to get approved given the 19x return multiple?

TURN 9 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
That makes a lot of sense - $1.25M feels much more realistic when you break it down like that. A 19x return multiple is still really strong, and you're right that investing 5% of the ARR we'll generate is a compelling story for leadership.

I think I could definitely get $1.25M approved, especially with those unit economics. The original $50 CAC target was probably too aggressive anyway - I was being optimistic based on some of our best-performing campaigns, but that's not sustainable at scale. Let's plan around the $125 CAC scenario and $1.25M budget.

AGENT:
Perfect - $1.25M budget at $125 CAC gives us a realistic foundation to build on. You're absolutely right that scaling requires different economics than your best-performing campaigns.

Now let's define your value proposition for the mid-market audience. When Chief Data Officers or VP Analytics at 200-500 employee companies are evaluating analytics solutions, what's your core message that differentiates CloudMetrics?

What specific pain point or outcome resonates most strongly with prospects who convert at that $125 CAC efficiency?
