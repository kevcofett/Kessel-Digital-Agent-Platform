# Media Plan Output: Budget Revision Midstream

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start - you've given me strong economic foundations. $500K / 10,000 = $50 per customer acquisition cost with $2,400 LTV creates a healthy 48x LTV/CAC ratio, which is excellent for B2B SaaS.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 10,000 new customers? For example, are you focused on revenue growth, market expansion, or hitting a particular ARR milestone?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Excellent - $24M ARR from 10,000 customers confirms your $2,400 LTV perfectly. Revenue growth with mid-market expansion gives us clear direction.

Now I need to understand how you'll measure success. What's your primary KPI - the main number you'll track to know if this campaign is working? 

For example, will you focus on new customer acquisitions, qualified leads, trial sign-ups, or something else as your key success metric?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Perfect! New customer acquisitions as primary KPI with 10,000 target is clear. Your funnel math checks out: 65,000 trials at 15% conversion = 9,750 customers, very close to your 10,000 target.

Your $50 implied CAC is aggressive but achievable for B2B SaaS. Based on industry benchmarks, mid-market SaaS typically sees $75-150 CAC, so you're targeting the efficient end. With your strong 48x LTV/CAC ratio, you have excellent unit economics even if acquisition costs run slightly higher.

Now let's define your audience. Who is your ideal mid-market customer? What job titles, company sizes, or industries should we focus on to hit that $50 CAC efficiently?

Turn 4:
Excellent targeting - data decision makers in data-rich verticals is smart positioning. Your 100-1000 employee range aligns perfectly with mid-market expansion goals.

Let me get more specific on audience sizing. Among companies with 100-1000 employees in tech, financial services, healthcare, and manufacturing, how many of the key decision makers (CDOs, VP Analytics, BI Directors) do you estimate are actively evaluating analytics solutions at any given time?

For context, this "in-market" percentage typically ranges from 3-8% in B2B SaaS depending on category maturity and pain urgency.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 5:
Great insight - 5-6% in-market rate is realistic for mature B2B SaaS, and your observation about the 200-500 employee pain point is valuable for targeting.

Now for geography: Are you focusing on specific regions, or is this a broad market approach? Given your mid-market expansion goal and $50 CAC target, geographic concentration often improves efficiency through better audience density and localized messaging.

Where do you see the strongest opportunity for these 10,000 new customers?

Turn 6:
Smart geographic focus - North America concentration with proven high-performing metro areas will definitely support your $50 CAC target through better audience density.

Your $500K budget across 10,000 customers is mathematically sound. Now let's validate the allocation makes sense. 

Based on your trial-to-customer conversion math, you need roughly 65,000 quality trials. If we assume typical B2B SaaS trial conversion rates from paid traffic, that suggests you'll need approximately 200,000-300,000 qualified visitors to generate those trials.

Does your budget feel adequate to drive that level of qualified traffic at your target efficiency, or should we model different scenarios?

Turn 7:
Excellent instinct - questioning the math shows strong strategic thinking. Let's model this realistically.

For B2B SaaS targeting your audience, qualified traffic typically costs $15-30 per visitor through paid channels. At the conservative end: 200,000 visitors × $20 = $4M in media spend, which is 8x your budget.

This suggests three potential paths:
1. Increase budget to match traffic requirements  
2. Improve funnel conversion rates to reduce traffic needs
3. Adjust volume targets to match budget reality

Before we dive deeper, what's more flexible - your $500K budget constraint or your 10,000 customer target? Understanding which has more room to move will help us build the most realistic plan.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
Smart thinking - with $2,400 LTV, you have room to increase CAC and still maintain strong unit economics.

Let me model realistic scenarios:

**Conservative Scenario:** $100 CAC
- Budget needed: 10,000 × $100 = $1M
- LTV/CAC ratio: 24x (still excellent)

**Market Reality Scenario:** $125 CAC  
- Budget needed: 10,000 × $125 = $1.25M
- LTV/CAC ratio: 19x (very strong)

Based on mid-market B2B SaaS benchmarks, $100-125 CAC is much more achievable than your original $50 target. At $1.25M budget, you're investing roughly 5% of the $24M ARR you'll generate - that's a compelling ROI story.

The $1-1.5M range you mentioned aligns perfectly with realistic market costs. Would $1.25M feel manageable to get approved given the 19x return multiple?

Turn 9:
Perfect - $1.25M budget at $125 CAC gives us a realistic foundation to build on. You're absolutely right that scaling requires different economics than your best-performing campaigns.

Now let's define your value proposition for the mid-market audience. When Chief Data Officers or VP Analytics at 200-500 employee companies are evaluating analytics solutions, what's your core message that differentiates CloudMetrics?

What specific pain point or outcome resonates most strongly with prospects who convert at that $125 CAC efficiency?
