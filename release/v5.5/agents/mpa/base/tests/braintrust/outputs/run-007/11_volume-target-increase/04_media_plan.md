# Media Plan Output: Volume Target Increase

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've given me great foundational data. Let me start with a quick calculation: $400K ÷ 5,000 customers = $80 per customer acquisition cost. With your $320 LTV, that's a healthy 4x ratio - well above the 3x threshold for sustainable growth.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 5,000 new customers? For example, are you focused on revenue growth, market expansion, or building your customer base for future retention campaigns?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect! Revenue growth with accountability to leadership - that's a clear objective. Your $80 CAC against $320 LTV gives you solid unit economics to work with.

Now I need to understand how you'll measure success. What's your primary metric for tracking progress? Will you focus on total revenue generated ($320 × 5,000 = $1.6M), new customer count (5,000), or something else like return on ad spend?

Turn 3:
I need to flag something important about ROAS as your primary KPI. Platform-reported ROAS is often inflated by 20-40% due to attribution issues and doesn't capture incrementality - meaning some sales would have happened anyway without ads.

For leadership reporting and realistic forecasting, I'd recommend tracking both:
- **Immediate metric**: New customer acquisitions (concrete, auditable)
- **Efficiency metric**: Cost per new customer ($80 target, easy to calculate)

Your 4:1 ROAS target translates to $100 cost per $400 in attributed revenue. But if that $400 includes repeat purchases over time rather than just first purchase, the math gets complex.

What's the average first purchase value for new customers? This helps us set realistic efficiency expectations and avoid the ROAS attribution trap.

Turn 4:
Excellent - that math works perfectly. $85 first purchase with $80 CAC gives you $5 immediate contribution per customer, and the real value comes from your $320 LTV over time.

Let me model your economics: At $80 per customer targeting 5,000 customers, you're projecting a 4x LTV/CAC ratio. Based on home goods benchmarks, this is achievable but requires disciplined audience targeting since the efficiency window is tighter than categories with higher first-purchase values.

Your economics are solid and your success metrics are clear. We're ready to move to audience definition.

Who is your ideal customer? I need to understand both demographics (age, income, location type) and behaviors (shopping patterns, interests, how they discover home goods). The more precise we can be, the better we can hit that $80 efficiency target.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Great foundation! Let me get more specific on the behavioral signals that will help us hit your $80 efficiency target.

Beyond Pinterest and Instagram browsing, what specific shopping behaviors indicate someone is likely to buy from HomeStyle Direct? For example:

- Do they typically research products extensively before buying?
- Are they more likely to purchase during home renovation periods?
- Do they respond to seasonal trends (spring refresh, holiday decorating)?
- Are there life events that trigger purchases (new home, moving, major life changes)?

The more precisely we can identify high-intent signals, the better we can focus your $400K on customers most likely to convert at your target efficiency.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Perfect - those behavioral signals give us strong targeting precision. Research-heavy buyers, seasonal refresh patterns, and life events are all trackable signals that should help us hit that $80 CAC target.

One more critical piece: Within your 30-55 homeowner audience, are there geographic patterns? Do you see better performance in certain regions, metro areas, or suburban types? 

For example, do customers in growing suburban markets convert differently than established suburbs? Any regional preferences for home styles that affect your product mix?

Understanding geographic performance will help us allocate your $400K efficiently across markets.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Excellent - that geographic insight is valuable. Growing suburban markets like Austin, Charlotte, Denver, and Phoenix align perfectly with your life-event triggers (new homes, moves), while Northeast and West Coast customers skew premium.

Your geography is solid: nationwide reach with performance patterns that make sense. Let's move to budget allocation.

You have $400K to acquire 5,000 customers at $80 each. How do you want to think about budget allocation? For example:

- Should we weight more heavily toward those high-performing growing markets?
- Any preference between focusing on fewer markets with deeper investment vs. broader national reach?
- Do you need to reserve any portion of the budget for retention/repeat customer campaigns, or is this $400K purely for new customer acquisition?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
Smart allocation thinking. 60% to high-performing growth markets and 40% national gives you efficiency focus while maintaining scale to hit 5,000 customers.

That breaks down to $240K targeting ~3,000 customers in growth markets at $80 CAC, and $160K targeting ~2,000 customers nationally. The math works cleanly.

Now let's define your value proposition. When your ideal customer - that suburban homeowner researching quality pieces for their home refresh or new house - sees your ads, what core message will make them choose HomeStyle Direct over competitors?

Is it product quality, style selection, price point, convenience, or something else that differentiates you in their decision process?

Turn 9:
Perfect - that's a compelling value proposition. "Quality pieces at accessible prices" with styling guidance hits your research-heavy customers who want professional results without premium costs.

Your value prop is clear: accessible quality + design confidence + reliable service. That resonates strongly with your suburban homeowner audience doing home refreshes.

Now we're ready for channel strategy. Based on your $400K budget, $80 CAC target, and audience that discovers you through social media and Google searches, what channels are you currently using or considering?

I'm thinking about the mix that will efficiently reach your Pinterest-browsing, research-heavy customers across those growth markets while hitting your 5,000 customer target.
