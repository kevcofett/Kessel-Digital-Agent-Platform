# Media Plan Output: Aggressive KPI - Must Narrow to Achieve

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect - you've given me excellent foundation data. Let me run the numbers:

$750K / 5,000 = $150 CAC exactly, with $2,400 LTV creating a healthy 16x LTV/CAC ratio.

Your $150 CAC target is aggressive for B2B SaaS. Industry benchmarks typically show $200-$400 CAC for your segment, based on SaaS growth data. To hit $150, we'll need surgical audience precision and channel efficiency.

Your SMB logistics manager profile is solid - companies stuck on spreadsheets have clear pain points, which helps conversion.

Before we dive into making these numbers work, I need to confirm your primary success metric. Is it 5,000 new customers as the main KPI, or would you measure success differently?

Turn 3:
Excellent - manufacturing as your primary vertical is smart. Those companies have clear pain points and understand logistics ROI, which should improve conversion rates and help hit your $150 CAC target.

Within manufacturing, let's get more precise since efficiency demands it. Are there specific manufacturing sub-sectors that convert best - automotive suppliers, industrial equipment, consumer goods manufacturing, or others?

And what's the typical decision-making unit you're selling into? Is it just the logistics manager, or do you typically need buy-in from operations directors, CFOs, or other stakeholders?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Got it - 5,000 new customers is locked in as your primary KPI, and the board pressure makes the efficiency target non-negotiable.

Your $150 CAC is definitely ambitious. Based on B2B SaaS benchmarks, you're targeting roughly 25-50% better efficiency than market typical. The good news is your 16x LTV/CAC ratio means even if you land at $200 CAC, you're still at a healthy 12x ratio.

To hit $150, we'll need every advantage: tight audience definition, optimal channel mix, and likely some aggressive testing to find efficiency pockets.

Your economics foundation is solid. Now let's define your audience with surgical precision since that's critical for hitting aggressive efficiency targets.

You mentioned SMB logistics managers at companies with 50-500 employees, $5M-$50M revenue, stuck on spreadsheets or legacy TMS. That's a strong start, but for $150 CAC efficiency, we need to get more specific.

What industry verticals within logistics perform best for you currently - manufacturing, retail, food & beverage, or others?

Turn 4:
Perfect - consumer goods manufacturing with logistics manager as entry point and operations director as decision maker. That dual-persona targeting will be crucial for your materials and channel strategy.

Now for geography. With your $750K budget and aggressive $150 CAC target, geographic focus could significantly impact efficiency.

Are you targeting all of North America, or would concentrating on specific regions or metro areas help you achieve better cost efficiency? Some B2B SaaS companies find focusing on major manufacturing hubs initially gives them better CAC performance.

Turn 6:
Perfect - 10-12 major manufacturing DMAs gives you solid scale while maintaining efficiency focus. The broader DMA approach initially makes sense since manufacturing has spread to suburban locations.

Your geographic strategy is locked. Now let's validate your budget allocation makes sense across this footprint.

$750K across 10-12 DMAs means roughly $60K-75K per market. At your $150 CAC target, that projects to 400-500 new customers per DMA. 

Does that volume per market align with your sales team capacity and market opportunity? Some markets like Chicago and Dallas might support higher volume while smaller ones like Columbus might be closer to 300-400 customers annually.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Smart - Tier 1 manufacturing hubs give you audience density and sales team proximity. That geographic focus should help your $150 CAC efficiency.

Let me get specific on your target markets. You mentioned Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, LA - are you thinking roughly 8-12 major DMAs, or a smaller focused list? And within those metros, are you targeting the broader DMA or focusing on specific corridors where manufacturing concentration is highest?

This matters because tighter geographic focus often improves CAC performance, especially with aggressive targets like yours.

Turn 8:
Excellent dual-persona messaging - cost savings for ops directors, visibility/control for logistics managers. That differentiated approach should boost conversion rates and help hit your aggressive CAC target.

Your value proposition is strong. Now for the critical piece - channel strategy. With $150 CAC targets and B2B SaaS complexity, channel selection will make or break this plan.

Based on your SMB manufacturing audience and dual-persona targeting, what channels are you currently using or considering? LinkedIn is typically strong for B2B SaaS, but we'll need to evaluate efficiency across your full channel mix to hit those numbers.

Turn 9:
Smart channel foundation - LinkedIn for relationship building, Google Search for intent capture, and G2/Capterra for social proof. That mix addresses different stages of your buyer journey.

Let me analyze your efficiency challenge across these channels:

**LinkedIn**: Typically $8-15 CPMs for B2B SaaS, but conversion rates around 2-4% to MQL. Your dual-persona targeting could help efficiency.

**Google Search**: Lower volume but higher intent - usually 15-25% better conversion rates than social, which helps your $150 CAC target.

**G2/Capterra**: Often overlooked but can deliver strong CAC performance since users are actively comparing solutions.

Given your aggressive targets, I'd recommend optimizing your current three channels first before expanding. The risk of spreading budget across too many channels could hurt efficiency.

For measurement, are you tracking full-funnel attribution from first touch to closed customer, or primarily last-touch? With $150 CAC targets, attribution accuracy becomes critical for optimization.

Turn 10:
You're right about attribution complexity - the dual-persona buyer journey makes optimization trickier. That attribution gap could be masking some channel performance, especially for G2/Capterra influence.

For budget allocation with your $150 CAC target, I'd recommend this weighted approach:

**Google Search: 50-55%** ($375K-410K) - Highest intent, best conversion rates, most likely to hit your efficiency target

**LinkedIn: 35-40%** ($260K-300K) - Critical for reaching both personas, but needs surgical targeting to combat high CPMs

**G2/Capterra: 5-10%** ($40K-75K) - Lower cost, high influence, good attribution assist even if not getting full credit

This allocation prioritizes your highest-converting channel while maintaining presence across the buyer journey.

For testing and optimization, what's your current approach? Are you running systematic A/B tests on creative, audiences, and landing pages, or more ad-hoc optimization? With aggressive CAC targets, structured testing becomes essential.

Turn 11:
You're absolutely right - systematic testing is critical for hitting $150 CAC. Ad-hoc won't cut it with targets this aggressive.

I'd recommend a structured 2-week testing cadence:

**Week 1-2**: Launch primary campaigns with baseline creative/audiences
**Week 3-4**: Test audience variations (job titles, company size ranges, geographic sub-segments)
**Week 5-6**: Test creative variations (cost savings vs. visibility messaging, different CTAs)
**Week 7-8**: Test landing page variations (dual-persona vs. single-persona pages)

Run 3-4 tests simultaneously but isolate variables. With your $750K budget, you have enough volume for statistical significance in 2-week windows.

Key testing priorities for your targets:
- LinkedIn audience precision (logistics manager vs. operations director weighting)
- Google Search keyword expansion vs. contraction
- Landing page conversion optimization

Now for risk assessment - what's your biggest concern about hitting these targets? Is it market saturation, competitive pressure, or something else that could derail the plan?

Turn 12:
Those are exactly the right risks to flag - competitive pressure and market saturation are real threats to your $150 CAC target.

**Competitive pressure mitigation:**
- Build audience exclusion lists of converted customers to avoid bidding wars over existing clients
- Create lookalike audiences from your best customers to find efficiency pockets competitors might miss
- Develop creative angles competitors can't easily copy (specific ROI case studies, industry-specific pain points)

**Market saturation hedge:**
- Plan geographic expansion into Tier 2 manufacturing markets (Milwaukee, Grand Rapids, Greenville SC) if Tier 1 efficiency degrades
- Build pipeline for adjacent verticals (food & beverage, automotive suppliers) as backup volume sources
- Front-load your easiest conversions in Q1-Q2 before market gets saturated

**Budget flexibility:**
- Hold back 10-15% of budget ($75K-110K) as a contingency fund
- If efficiency holds, reinvest in best-performing markets
- If CAC inflates, shift to lower-cost channels or geographies

Your plan is solid with realistic risk mitigation. You've got the foundation to make $150 CAC work if you execute the testing discipline and stay agile on competitive threats. Ready to move forward with this strategy?

Turn 13:
Excellent - you've got a comprehensive plan that balances aggressive targets with realistic execution. The systematic testing, risk mitigation, and budget flexibility should give you multiple paths to hit that $150 CAC.

For launch timing, I'd recommend:

**Week 1-2**: Set up tracking, build audiences, create baseline creative
**Week 3**: Soft launch with 25% of monthly budget to validate setup
**Week 4**: Full launch if metrics look good, or adjust if needed

This gives you a validation period before committing full budget, which is critical with aggressive board targets.

You've built a solid media plan: 5,000 customers at $150 CAC across 10-12 manufacturing DMAs, weighted budget allocation (55% Google Search, 35% LinkedIn, 10% G2/Capterra), systematic 2-week testing cycles, and geographic/vertical expansion as safety valves.

The plan is aggressive but achievable with disciplined execution. Your 16x LTV/CAC ratio gives you cushion even if you land at $175-200 CAC. 

Ready to show the board you can scale efficiently? This strategy positions you well for that next funding round.
