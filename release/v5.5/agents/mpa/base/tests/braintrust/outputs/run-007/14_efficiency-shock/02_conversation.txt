TURN 1 (Step 1)

USER:
Hi, I'm the Director of Digital Marketing at SecureLife Insurance. We sell life and annuity products. I need to build a media plan for next year. We have a $750K budget and need 15,000 new policy applications. Our average LTV is about $2,800 per policyholder. Can you help?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business outcome. You mentioned needing 15,000 new policy applications - is your primary objective to drive qualified applications, or are you measuring success by actual policies issued? The distinction matters for how we structure the funnel and efficiency targets.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 2 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're primarily focused on driving qualified applications - that's our main KPI. Of course we care about actual policies issued too, but the sales team handles the conversion from application to policy, so marketing gets measured on those 15,000 applications. I'd say about 60% of our qualified applications typically convert to issued policies, so we're looking at roughly 9,000 new policies if we hit our application target.

AGENT:
Perfect! So your primary objective is driving 15,000 qualified policy applications, with applications as your main KPI.

Let me run the efficiency math: $750K ÷ 15,000 = $50 per application. With your $2,800 LTV, that projects to a 56x LTV-to-acquisition-cost ratio, which is exceptionally strong for insurance.

However, I want to validate this efficiency target. Based on insurance industry benchmarks, qualified life insurance applications typically cost $75-150 through digital channels, depending on product complexity and audience precision. Your $50 target is quite aggressive.

Have you achieved similar application costs in previous campaigns, or is this a new efficiency target you're aiming for?

TURN 3 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Honestly, we haven't tracked our CAC that precisely in the past - our attribution has been pretty messy. I think we've been somewhere in the $60-80 range for applications, but that's just a rough estimate based on what I remember from our quarterly reviews. The $50 target is definitely aspirational - our CMO set it based on wanting to improve efficiency year-over-year. If the industry benchmark is $75-150, maybe we should adjust our expectations and target closer to $75 per application?

AGENT:
That's smart thinking. At $75 per application, your budget would project to approximately 10,000 applications ($750K ÷ $75 = 10,000), which is 5,000 short of your 15,000 target.

You have three realistic paths forward:

1. **Increase budget**: $75 × 15,000 = $1.125M total budget needed
2. **Adjust target**: Accept 10,000 applications at current budget with proven efficiency
3. **Efficiency play**: Target $50 through tighter audience definition and channel optimization - ambitious but possible with disciplined execution

Given your CMO wants efficiency improvement and you mentioned messy attribution, there's likely optimization opportunity. Many insurance advertisers achieve $60-75 range with solid first-party data and precise targeting.

Which direction feels most realistic for your organization - increasing budget, adjusting the target, or pursuing the efficiency challenge?

Events: calculation_performed, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 4 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I think we should go with the efficiency play. The CMO is really focused on improving our performance year-over-year, and getting additional budget approval would be tough in this environment. Plus, you're right about the optimization opportunity - our attribution has been all over the place, so there's definitely room to get more precise with our targeting and channel mix. If we can hit that $60-65 range instead of our historical $75-80, that gets us much closer to the 15,000 applications. What would you recommend for tightening up our audience definition and channel strategy?

AGENT:
Excellent choice - the efficiency play is definitely achievable with disciplined execution. At $60-65 per application, you'd hit 11,500-12,500 applications, which gets you much closer to your 15,000 target.

However, let's build this strategically. Before we dive into channels and tactics, I need to understand your audience precisely - that's what will unlock the efficiency gains.

For life insurance, audience precision is critical since consideration varies dramatically by life stage and financial situation. Who is your ideal policyholder? Are you targeting young families needing term life, affluent professionals seeking whole life, or pre-retirees looking at annuities - or a mix?

The more precisely we can define your highest-converting audience segments, the better we can optimize toward that $60-65 efficiency target.

TURN 5 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our core audience is adults aged 35-60 with families - we're primarily focused on term life insurance since that's our bread and butter product. These are typically middle to upper-middle class families who've hit that life stage where they're thinking about protecting their dependents if something happens to them. We do sell some whole life and annuities, but probably 70% of our business comes from term life policies. The sweet spot seems to be parents with young kids or teenagers who suddenly realize they need coverage but haven't gotten around to it yet.

AGENT:
Perfect - that's a well-defined core audience with clear behavioral triggers. Parents aged 35-60 with dependents is a solid foundation for precision targeting.

Now I need to understand the geographic scope. Are you licensed to sell in all 50 states, or do you have specific state restrictions? And within your licensed territories, are there particular regions or markets where you see stronger performance or want to focus?

Geography will significantly impact both your audience sizing and channel efficiency, especially for insurance where regulations and competitive landscapes vary by state.

TURN 6 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're licensed nationwide - all 50 states. We don't really have any geographic restrictions from a regulatory standpoint. Historically, we've seen stronger performance in suburban markets in the Southeast and Midwest, but that might just be where we've focused our previous campaigns rather than actual market differences. We haven't done much regional analysis to identify our best-performing markets, so I'm pretty open to recommendations on where to focus geographically for better efficiency.

AGENT:
Great - nationwide licensing gives us full flexibility. Since you haven't done deep regional analysis, let me model your target audience sizing to identify the highest-opportunity markets.

For parents aged 35-60 with children, I'll analyze DMA-level population data to find markets with the highest concentration of your target demographic. This will help us allocate budget toward markets where your $60-65 efficiency target is most achievable.

I'll need to pull demographic data for households with children by DMA, filtered for your age range and income levels. Would you prefer to focus on the top 25-30 DMAs for concentrated impact, or cast a wider net across 50+ markets? 

The trade-off is typically efficiency versus scale - fewer markets allow for more precise optimization, while broader reach gives you more volume potential.

TURN 7 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I think starting with the top 25-30 DMAs makes sense, especially since we're trying to hit that aggressive efficiency target. If we can prove the model works in those concentrated markets and hit our $60-65 per application goal, we can always expand to more markets later in the year or next year. Plus, with our attribution being messy historically, having fewer markets will make it easier to track performance and optimize. What kind of demographic concentration are you looking for in those top markets?

AGENT:
Excellent strategic thinking - focusing on 25-30 DMAs will definitely help with both efficiency and attribution clarity.

For demographic concentration, I'm looking for DMAs with above-average density of:
- Households with children under 18
- Adults aged 35-60 (your target range)
- Household income $50K-150K (typical term life insurance buyers)
- Homeownership rates (correlates with family stability and insurance awareness)

Based on these factors, markets like Atlanta, Dallas, Charlotte, Nashville, Indianapolis, and similar suburban-heavy metros typically show strong concentration of your target demo.

Now let's talk budget allocation. With your $750K across 25-30 markets, that's roughly $25-30K per market. Given your efficiency goals, how do you want to weight the allocation - equal spend across all markets to test performance, or should we front-load budget toward the highest-opportunity DMAs based on demographic density?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 8 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I think we should front-load the budget toward the highest-opportunity DMAs. Those markets you mentioned - Atlanta, Dallas, Charlotte - align really well with where we've seen some of our best performance historically. If we're trying to hit that aggressive $60-65 efficiency target, it makes sense to put more money where we have the best chance of success rather than spreading it equally across all markets. Maybe we allocate 60% of the budget to the top 10-12 markets and then distribute the remaining 40% across the other markets for testing? That way we're maximizing our chances of hitting the application target while still getting some data on secondary markets.

AGENT:
Perfect allocation strategy. 60% to top 10-12 markets and 40% to test markets gives you both concentrated firepower and learning opportunity.

That breaks down to:
- $450K across top 10-12 markets = $37.5-45K per top market
- $300K across 15-18 test markets = $16.7-20K per test market

The top markets get meaningful budget for optimization while test markets still have enough spend to generate statistically significant data.

Now let's define your value proposition. For parents aged 35-60 considering term life insurance, what's your key differentiator? Are you competing primarily on price, application simplicity, coverage amount flexibility, or something else?

This will shape how we message across channels and influences which platforms will be most effective for your efficiency goals.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 9 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our main differentiator is probably application simplicity - we've streamlined our process so people can get a quote and apply online in about 10 minutes, and for healthy applicants we can often approve coverage without a medical exam. Price is competitive but not our lowest, and our coverage options are pretty standard. The real value prop is convenience - we know our target audience is busy parents who've been putting off getting life insurance, so we've made it as easy as possible to actually follow through and get covered. We also have pretty good customer service ratings, which helps with trust since life insurance can feel intimidating for people who haven't bought it before.

AGENT:
Excellent - "easy coverage for busy parents" is a compelling value prop that directly addresses your audience's main barrier. The 10-minute application with no medical exam for healthy applicants is a strong differentiator in insurance.

This positions you well for digital channels where convenience messaging resonates, and it supports your $60-65 efficiency target since you're solving a real friction point.

Now for your channel strategy. Given your objective (qualified applications), audience (busy parents 35-60), and value prop (convenience), I'm seeing several high-potential channels:

**Recommended mix:**
- **Paid Search (40%)** - $300K - Captures "life insurance" intent when parents are actively researching
- **Paid Social (35%)** - $262K - Targets life stage triggers on Meta/Instagram 
- **Programmatic Display (15%)** - $112K - Retargeting and lookalike expansion
- **Connected TV (10%)** - $75K - Builds awareness among suburban families

This mix prioritizes intent capture and life-stage targeting while maintaining your efficiency goals. Does this align with your current channel experience, or are there channels here you haven't used before?

TURN 10 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
That channel mix looks pretty solid to me. We've been doing paid search and some Facebook advertising, so we're comfortable with those channels. The programmatic display piece is something we've dabbled in but haven't really optimized - mostly just basic retargeting campaigns. Connected TV is completely new for us though. I'm intrigued by the idea since it makes sense for reaching suburban families, but I'm not sure about the mechanics or how we'd measure applications from CTV. Is that $75K enough to make a meaningful impact, or should we maybe reallocate some of that budget to channels we know better?

AGENT:
Great question about CTV measurement - that's the biggest challenge with that channel. CTV attribution for insurance applications is notoriously difficult, and at $75K you'd be in learning mode for most of the campaign without clear ROI visibility.

Given your aggressive efficiency targets and need for clean attribution, I'd recommend reallocating that CTV budget to proven channels:

**Revised mix:**
- **Paid Search (45%)** - $337K - Your highest-intent channel
- **Paid Social (40%)** - $300K - Strong life-stage targeting capabilities  
- **Programmatic Display (15%)** - $112K - Focus on retargeting and lookalikes

This gives you more firepower in channels where you can directly track applications and optimize toward your $60-65 target. The extra search budget especially makes sense since insurance searchers have high intent.

We can always test CTV later once you've proven the efficiency model with measurable channels. Does this reallocation feel more aligned with your measurement needs?
