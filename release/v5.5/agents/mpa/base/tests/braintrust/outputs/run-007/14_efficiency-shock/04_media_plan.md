# Media Plan Output: Efficiency Shock

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business outcome. You mentioned needing 15,000 new policy applications - is your primary objective to drive qualified applications, or are you measuring success by actual policies issued? The distinction matters for how we structure the funnel and efficiency targets.

Turn 2:
Perfect! So your primary objective is driving 15,000 qualified policy applications, with applications as your main KPI.

Let me run the efficiency math: $750K ÷ 15,000 = $50 per application. With your $2,800 LTV, that projects to a 56x LTV-to-acquisition-cost ratio, which is exceptionally strong for insurance.

However, I want to validate this efficiency target. Based on insurance industry benchmarks, qualified life insurance applications typically cost $75-150 through digital channels, depending on product complexity and audience precision. Your $50 target is quite aggressive.

Have you achieved similar application costs in previous campaigns, or is this a new efficiency target you're aiming for?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
That's smart thinking. At $75 per application, your budget would project to approximately 10,000 applications ($750K ÷ $75 = 10,000), which is 5,000 short of your 15,000 target.

You have three realistic paths forward:

1. **Increase budget**: $75 × 15,000 = $1.125M total budget needed
2. **Adjust target**: Accept 10,000 applications at current budget with proven efficiency
3. **Efficiency play**: Target $50 through tighter audience definition and channel optimization - ambitious but possible with disciplined execution

Given your CMO wants efficiency improvement and you mentioned messy attribution, there's likely optimization opportunity. Many insurance advertisers achieve $60-75 range with solid first-party data and precise targeting.

Which direction feels most realistic for your organization - increasing budget, adjusting the target, or pursuing the efficiency challenge?

Turn 4:
Excellent choice - the efficiency play is definitely achievable with disciplined execution. At $60-65 per application, you'd hit 11,500-12,500 applications, which gets you much closer to your 15,000 target.

However, let's build this strategically. Before we dive into channels and tactics, I need to understand your audience precisely - that's what will unlock the efficiency gains.

For life insurance, audience precision is critical since consideration varies dramatically by life stage and financial situation. Who is your ideal policyholder? Are you targeting young families needing term life, affluent professionals seeking whole life, or pre-retirees looking at annuities - or a mix?

The more precisely we can define your highest-converting audience segments, the better we can optimize toward that $60-65 efficiency target.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Perfect - that's a well-defined core audience with clear behavioral triggers. Parents aged 35-60 with dependents is a solid foundation for precision targeting.

Now I need to understand the geographic scope. Are you licensed to sell in all 50 states, or do you have specific state restrictions? And within your licensed territories, are there particular regions or markets where you see stronger performance or want to focus?

Geography will significantly impact both your audience sizing and channel efficiency, especially for insurance where regulations and competitive landscapes vary by state.

Turn 6:
Great - nationwide licensing gives us full flexibility. Since you haven't done deep regional analysis, let me model your target audience sizing to identify the highest-opportunity markets.

For parents aged 35-60 with children, I'll analyze DMA-level population data to find markets with the highest concentration of your target demographic. This will help us allocate budget toward markets where your $60-65 efficiency target is most achievable.

I'll need to pull demographic data for households with children by DMA, filtered for your age range and income levels. Would you prefer to focus on the top 25-30 DMAs for concentrated impact, or cast a wider net across 50+ markets? 

The trade-off is typically efficiency versus scale - fewer markets allow for more precise optimization, while broader reach gives you more volume potential.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Excellent strategic thinking - focusing on 25-30 DMAs will definitely help with both efficiency and attribution clarity.

For demographic concentration, I'm looking for DMAs with above-average density of:
- Households with children under 18
- Adults aged 35-60 (your target range)
- Household income $50K-150K (typical term life insurance buyers)
- Homeownership rates (correlates with family stability and insurance awareness)

Based on these factors, markets like Atlanta, Dallas, Charlotte, Nashville, Indianapolis, and similar suburban-heavy metros typically show strong concentration of your target demo.

Now let's talk budget allocation. With your $750K across 25-30 markets, that's roughly $25-30K per market. Given your efficiency goals, how do you want to weight the allocation - equal spend across all markets to test performance, or should we front-load budget toward the highest-opportunity DMAs based on demographic density?

Turn 8:
Perfect allocation strategy. 60% to top 10-12 markets and 40% to test markets gives you both concentrated firepower and learning opportunity.

That breaks down to:
- $450K across top 10-12 markets = $37.5-45K per top market
- $300K across 15-18 test markets = $16.7-20K per test market

The top markets get meaningful budget for optimization while test markets still have enough spend to generate statistically significant data.

Now let's define your value proposition. For parents aged 35-60 considering term life insurance, what's your key differentiator? Are you competing primarily on price, application simplicity, coverage amount flexibility, or something else?

This will shape how we message across channels and influences which platforms will be most effective for your efficiency goals.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Great question about CTV measurement - that's the biggest challenge with that channel. CTV attribution for insurance applications is notoriously difficult, and at $75K you'd be in learning mode for most of the campaign without clear ROI visibility.

Given your aggressive efficiency targets and need for clean attribution, I'd recommend reallocating that CTV budget to proven channels:

**Revised mix:**
- **Paid Search (45%)** - $337K - Your highest-intent channel
- **Paid Social (40%)** - $300K - Strong life-stage targeting capabilities  
- **Programmatic Display (15%)** - $112K - Focus on retargeting and lookalikes

This gives you more firepower in channels where you can directly track applications and optimize toward your $60-65 target. The extra search budget especially makes sense since insurance searchers have high intent.

We can always test CTV later once you've proven the efficiency model with measurable channels. Does this reallocation feel more aligned with your measurement needs?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Excellent - "easy coverage for busy parents" is a compelling value prop that directly addresses your audience's main barrier. The 10-minute application with no medical exam for healthy applicants is a strong differentiator in insurance.

This positions you well for digital channels where convenience messaging resonates, and it supports your $60-65 efficiency target since you're solving a real friction point.

Now for your channel strategy. Given your objective (qualified applications), audience (busy parents 35-60), and value prop (convenience), I'm seeing several high-potential channels:

**Recommended mix:**
- **Paid Search (40%)** - $300K - Captures "life insurance" intent when parents are actively researching
- **Paid Social (35%)** - $262K - Targets life stage triggers on Meta/Instagram 
- **Programmatic Display (15%)** - $112K - Retargeting and lookalike expansion
- **Connected TV (10%)** - $75K - Builds awareness among suburban families

This mix prioritizes intent capture and life-stage targeting while maintaining your efficiency goals. Does this align with your current channel experience, or are there channels here you haven't used before?
