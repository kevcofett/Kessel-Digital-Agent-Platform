TURN 1 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Hi, I'm the VP of Marketing at Urban Essentials, a fashion retail brand. We're planning our media strategy for the coming year. Budget is $1.2M, and we need to acquire 25,000 new customers over the next 12 months. LTV is about $180. Help me build a plan?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your business outcome. You mentioned acquiring 25,000 new customers - is customer acquisition your primary objective, or are you also focused on revenue growth, brand awareness, or retention alongside acquisition?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 2 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Customer acquisition is definitely our primary focus right now - we're in a growth phase and need to expand our customer base in the urban markets. Revenue growth naturally follows from that with our LTV of $180. Brand awareness is important too since we're still building recognition in some of our target metros, but acquisition is the main KPI we'll be measured on this year.

AGENT:
Perfect. So customer acquisition is your primary objective with 25,000 new customers as your success target. 

Let me quickly check the economics: $1.2M ÷ 25,000 = $48 per customer acquisition cost. With your $180 LTV, that projects to a healthy 3.75x LTV/CAC ratio - well above the 3x threshold that high-performing fashion brands typically maintain.

Your target efficiency looks very achievable for fashion retail. The $48 CAC is conservative compared to typical fashion benchmarks of $45-65, which gives us good flexibility for channel mix and testing.

Since you mentioned building recognition in target metros, what specific urban markets are you prioritizing for this expansion?

TURN 3 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're focusing on major metros like NYC, LA, Chicago, and Miami where we already have some presence, but we also want to expand into tier 2 cities like Austin, Nashville, Denver, and Portland. These secondary markets have shown strong growth in our target demographic and less competition from other fashion brands. We're seeing good engagement on social in these markets, so we think there's real opportunity to scale there with the right media mix.

AGENT:
Excellent geographic strategy - mixing established metros with high-opportunity tier 2 markets is smart. Those secondary cities often deliver better efficiency due to lower competition while still having concentrated target demographics.

Now let's define your target customer more precisely. You mentioned your target demographic is showing strong engagement in these markets. Can you describe who this core customer is - their key characteristics, behaviors, or what makes them most likely to discover and purchase from Urban Essentials?

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 4 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our core customer is fashion-forward women aged 25-45 living in urban areas. They're typically young professionals or established career women with disposable income who care about staying current with trends but want pieces that work for both their professional and social lives. They're digitally native - spending a lot of time on Instagram and TikTok discovering new brands and styles. They value quality and versatility in their wardrobe choices, looking for pieces that can transition from work to weekend. These women are also socially conscious and prefer brands that align with their values around sustainability and inclusivity.

AGENT:
Great profile - fashion-forward urban professional women 25-45 who value versatile, quality pieces and brand values alignment. The digital native behavior on Instagram and TikTok gives us clear channel signals for later.

To size this audience properly, do you have any data on how many women fitting this profile exist across your target markets? Or alternatively, what percentage of women 25-45 in these metros would you estimate match your core customer characteristics - the fashion-forward, digitally engaged, values-conscious segment?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 5 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I don't have exact data on hand, but based on our social media analytics and market research, I'd estimate maybe 15-20% of women in that age range in our target metros would fit our core profile. In the major metros like NYC and LA, it might be closer to 25% given the fashion-forward culture, while in the tier 2 cities it's probably more like 12-15%. That's still a pretty substantial addressable audience when you're talking about markets with millions of people, and we've seen good conversion rates when we can reach the right segments through targeted social campaigns.

AGENT:
Perfect. Using your 15-20% estimate with higher concentration in major metros gives us a substantial addressable audience across these markets.

Let me structure your target geography with audience sizing. I'll use DMA-level analysis for your 8 target markets:

**TARGET GEOGRAPHY ANALYSIS**

| DMA Market | Total Population | Women 25-45 | Target % | Target Audience Size |
|------------|------------------|-------------|----------|---------------------|
| New York | 7,450,000 | 1,340,000 | 25% | 335,000 |
| Los Angeles | 5,200,000 | 935,000 | 25% | 234,000 |
| Chicago | 3,470,000 | 625,000 | 20% | 125,000 |
| Miami-Ft. Lauderdale | 2,750,000 | 495,000 | 20% | 99,000 |
| Austin | 2,350,000 | 425,000 | 15% | 64,000 |
| Denver | 1,740,000 | 315,000 | 15% | 47,000 |
| Nashville | 1,900,000 | 340,000 | 15% | 51,000 |
| Portland | 1,240,000 | 225,000 | 12% | 27,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **26,100,000** | **4,700,000** | **21%** | **982,000** |

Your total addressable audience is nearly 1 million target customers across these markets. At your 25,000 acquisition target, you'd need to convert roughly 2.5% of your addressable audience - very realistic for fashion retail with strong digital targeting.

Does this geographic breakdown align with your market priorities?

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 6 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Yes, this breakdown looks really solid and aligns well with our priorities. I like how you've weighted the major metros higher - that 25% in NYC and LA makes sense given the fashion culture there. The tier 2 cities at 12-15% also feels right based on what we've seen in our early testing.

Having nearly a million addressable customers gives us great scale to work with, and that 2.5% conversion rate seems very achievable, especially since we're already seeing good engagement rates in these markets. This gives me confidence we can hit our 25K target while still having room for optimization and growth.

AGENT:
Excellent - your geography foundation is solid with strong addressable audience scale and realistic conversion requirements.

Now let's move to budget allocation. With your $1.2M total budget and these 8 target markets, we need to decide how to distribute spend. 

Should we weight the allocation based on market size and opportunity (larger budgets to NYC/LA), or do you prefer a more balanced approach that gives meaningful investment to test and scale the tier 2 markets? Your current presence and performance data in these markets would help guide this decision.

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 7 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I think we should weight it based on market size and opportunity, but not too heavily. Maybe allocate about 50-60% of the budget to the four major metros since they have the largest addressable audiences and we already have some presence there. But I definitely want meaningful investment in the tier 2 cities - maybe 40-50% of budget - because that's where we see the biggest growth opportunity and potentially better efficiency due to less competition. We've been seeing really promising early engagement in Austin and Denver especially, so I don't want to under-invest there just because they're smaller markets.

AGENT:
Smart approach - balancing proven scale with growth opportunity. Let me model a weighted allocation that gives major metros meaningful investment while ensuring tier 2 cities get sufficient budget for optimization.

**BUDGET ALLOCATION BY MARKET**

| Market Tier | Markets | Target Audience | Budget | % of Total | Per Market Avg |
|-------------|---------|-----------------|--------|------------|----------------|
| **Major Metros** | NYC, LA, Chicago, Miami | 793,000 | $660,000 | 55% | $165,000 |
| **Tier 2 Growth** | Austin, Denver, Nashville, Portland | 189,000 | $540,000 | 45% | $135,000 |
| **TOTAL** | 8 markets | 982,000 | $1,200,000 | 100% | $150,000 |

This gives major metros 55% of budget while investing meaningfully in tier 2 growth markets at 45%. Each tier 2 market gets $135K - sufficient for meaningful testing and optimization across multiple channels.

The allocation projects to:
- Major metros: $660K ÷ 13,750 target customers = $48 CAC
- Tier 2 markets: $540K ÷ 11,250 target customers = $48 CAC

Consistent efficiency targets across both tiers. Does this allocation feel right for your growth strategy?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 8 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
This allocation looks perfect - I love that we're getting consistent $48 CAC across both tiers, which keeps our LTV/CAC ratio healthy at 3.75x everywhere. The 55/45 split gives us the scale we need in the major metros while still investing meaningfully in the tier 2 markets where we see the growth opportunity. 

$135K per tier 2 market should definitely be enough to run meaningful campaigns across multiple channels and really optimize performance. This feels like the right balance between scaling what's working and investing in our future growth markets.

AGENT:
Perfect! Your budget allocation provides solid foundation for both scale and growth. Now let's define your value proposition.

You mentioned customers want pieces that work for professional and social lives, value quality and versatility, and prefer brands aligned with sustainability and inclusivity values. 

What's Urban Essentials' core brand promise that differentiates you from other fashion retailers? In other words, when your ideal customer discovers your brand, what unique value do you deliver that makes her choose you over competitors?

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 9 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our core brand promise is "Effortless versatility for the modern woman." We're not just another fast fashion brand - we create thoughtfully designed pieces that seamlessly transition from boardroom to brunch, using sustainable materials and ethical manufacturing practices. What really differentiates us is that combination of style versatility with values alignment - our customers don't have to choose between looking great and feeling good about their purchase.

We focus on elevated basics and statement pieces that work together, so women can build a cohesive wardrobe rather than buying one-off trendy items. Plus, we're size-inclusive from XS to 3XL and feature real women of diverse backgrounds in our campaigns. It's premium quality at accessible price points with the sustainability and inclusivity values our customers care about.

AGENT:
Excellent value proposition - "Effortless versatility for the modern woman" with the sustainability/inclusivity values alignment is compelling and differentiating.

Now let's build your channel strategy. Given your target customer's digital-native behavior on Instagram and TikTok, plus your need for both acquisition and brand building across 8 markets, we'll need a multi-channel approach.

Based on your $48 CAC target, fashion vertical, and digitally engaged audience, I'm seeing strong potential for:
- Paid social (Meta/Instagram, TikTok) for discovery and engagement
- Google Search for intent capture 
- Programmatic display for awareness and retargeting
- Possibly connected TV for brand building in key markets

Which channels have you tested before, and where have you seen your best performance to date?

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 10 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We've had the most success with Instagram and Google Search so far - Instagram has been our strongest performer for both engagement and conversions, especially with our target demographic. The visual nature really showcases our pieces well, and we're seeing good ROAS there. Google Search has been solid for capturing intent when people are actively looking for sustainable fashion or versatile work wear.

We've done some limited TikTok testing and the engagement rates are incredible, but we haven't fully optimized for conversions yet - it's been more brand awareness focused. We haven't really touched programmatic display or connected TV, but I'm intrigued by CTV for building brand recognition in those tier 2 markets where we need more awareness. The combination you're suggesting makes sense given our mix of acquisition and brand building goals.

AGENT:
Perfect foundation - Instagram's strong performance and Google Search's intent capture give us proven channels to build on. TikTok's high engagement with conversion optimization upside is exactly what we want for your audience.

Given your $1.2M budget and performance data, here's a strategic channel mix:

**RECOMMENDED CHANNEL ALLOCATION**

| Channel | Budget | % | Strategy Focus |
|---------|--------|---|----------------|
| **Meta/Instagram** | $480,000 | 40% | Primary acquisition + retargeting |
| **Google Search** | $300,000 | 25% | Intent capture + branded defense |
| **TikTok** | $240,000 | 20% | Discovery + conversion optimization |
| **Connected TV** | $120,000 | 10% | Brand awareness in tier 2 markets |
| **Testing Reserve** | $60,000 | 5% | New platform/creative testing |

This prioritizes your proven performers while scaling TikTok's conversion potential and adding CTV for tier 2 awareness. The 40% Instagram allocation maintains your strongest channel while 25% Search ensures intent capture.

Does this allocation align with your channel priorities and comfort level?

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 11 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
This channel allocation looks really strong - I like how you're prioritizing our proven performers with 40% on Instagram where we know we can drive results, and 25% on Google Search for that intent capture. The 20% on TikTok feels right for scaling up our conversion optimization there, especially since we're already seeing great engagement rates.

The 10% on Connected TV is smart for building awareness in those tier 2 markets where we need more brand recognition. And I love that you included a 5% testing reserve - that gives us flexibility to experiment with new opportunities as they come up. This feels like the right balance between doubling down on what's working and investing in growth channels.

AGENT:
Excellent! Your channel strategy balances proven performance with strategic growth opportunities.

Now let's establish measurement. With your $48 CAC target and multi-channel approach, we need metrics that capture both direct performance and cross-channel effects.

**PRIMARY MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK:**

**Core KPIs:**
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): $48 target
- New Customer Count: 25,000 target  
- LTV/CAC Ratio: 3.75x target

**Channel Performance Metrics:**
- Meta/Instagram: CPA, ROAS, engagement rate
- Google Search: CPA, conversion rate, impression share
- TikTok: CPA, view-through conversions, engagement
- Connected TV: Brand lift, assisted conversions

**Cross-Channel Tracking:**
- First-touch attribution for awareness channels
- Last-touch for direct response
- View-through conversion windows

Given Instagram's strong performance and multi-channel complexity, what attribution model are you currently using, and do you have incrementality testing capability to validate true channel impact?

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 12 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're currently using last-click attribution mostly, which I know isn't ideal for a multi-channel strategy. Instagram gets a lot of credit since it's often the final touchpoint, but I suspect our upper-funnel channels like the CTV we're planning aren't getting proper attribution. We have Google Analytics set up with some view-through tracking, but honestly our incrementality testing is pretty limited right now.

I'd love to move toward a more sophisticated attribution model that gives proper credit to awareness channels, especially as we scale TikTok and add Connected TV. Do you think we should implement first-touch attribution for the awareness channels while keeping last-touch for search? And what's the best way to set up incrementality testing with our budget constraints?

AGENT:
You're absolutely right - last-click attribution will severely undervalue your awareness investments, especially CTV and upper-funnel TikTok content.

**RECOMMENDED ATTRIBUTION STRATEGY:**

**Multi-Touch Attribution Model:**
- First-touch credit for awareness (CTV, TikTok, upper-funnel Instagram)
- Last-touch credit for intent capture (Google Search, retargeting)
- View-through windows: 1-day click, 7-day view for social; 28-day for CTV

**Budget-Friendly Incrementality Testing:**
- Geographic lift tests: Compare CTV markets vs. control markets
- Platform holdout tests: Meta's Conversion Lift (built-in, no extra cost)
- Search brand lift: Monitor branded search volume increases
- Cross-channel correlation analysis using your existing GA4 data

**Implementation Priority:**
1. Set up proper view-through tracking in GA4 (immediate)
2. Configure Meta Conversion Lift studies (month 1)
3. Design geo-holdout test for CTV launch (month 2)

This approach validates true incrementality without requiring expensive third-party measurement platforms. The geo-testing for CTV will be especially valuable for proving tier 2 market impact.

Does this measurement approach feel manageable with your current resources?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 13 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Yes, this measurement approach feels very manageable and honestly much more sophisticated than what we have now. I love that you're prioritizing the GA4 setup first since that's something we can implement immediately with our existing resources.

The Meta Conversion Lift studies are perfect - I didn't realize that was built-in at no extra cost, so that's a huge win. And the geo-holdout test for CTV is brilliant for proving impact in those tier 2 markets where we're investing so heavily. The phased implementation timeline makes sense too - we can build our measurement capabilities as we scale the campaigns rather than trying to do everything at once.

AGENT:
Perfect! Your measurement framework will give you the data needed to optimize across channels and prove incrementality.

Now let's design your testing strategy. With $60,000 in testing reserve plus built-in platform testing, we can validate key assumptions and discover new opportunities.

**RECOMMENDED TESTING ROADMAP:**

**Quarter 1 Priority Tests:**
- TikTok conversion optimization: Creative formats vs. awareness content ($15K)
- Instagram audience expansion: Lookalikes vs. interest targeting ($10K)
- CTV creative testing: 15-second vs. 30-second spots ($10K)

**Quarter 2-3 Expansion:**
- YouTube Shorts: Leverage TikTok creative for Google ecosystem ($15K)
- Pinterest: Visual platform test for fashion discovery ($10K)

**Ongoing Platform Tests:**
- Meta: Creative fatigue rotation, audience refinement
- Google: Smart Bidding vs. manual, ad extension testing

The Q1 tests directly optimize your core channels, while Q2-3 explores adjacent opportunities. Each test has clear success metrics tied to your $48 CAC target.

What testing priorities interest you most, or are there specific assumptions you want to validate first?
