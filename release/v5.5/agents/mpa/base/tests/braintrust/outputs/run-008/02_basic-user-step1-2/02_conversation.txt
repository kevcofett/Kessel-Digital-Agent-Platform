USER:
Hi! I'm looking to get more people to buy shoes from our online store. Can you help me figure out the best way to do that?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve? For example, are you looking to get a certain number of new customers, hit a revenue target, or grow your customer base by a specific amount?

TURN 2 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We want to increase our sales and get more customers to our website. I'd say our main goal is to hit a revenue target - maybe around $500,000 in additional sales this year? We're also hoping to build up our customer base since we're still pretty new in the online space.

AGENT:
Perfect! So your main objective is $500,000 in additional revenue this year, plus growing your customer base since you're newer online.

To measure success, we need one primary number to track. Since you mentioned both revenue and customers, which would be the main way you'd measure if this campaign succeeded - total dollars in new sales, or the number of new customers you bring in?

USER:
I think the total dollars in new sales would be the main thing we'd want to track. That $500,000 revenue target is what I'll probably get judged on at the end of the year. Getting new customers is important too, but if we're hitting that sales number, it usually means we're doing well with customers anyway, right?

AGENT:
Exactly right! Revenue is your primary success measure, and more customers typically follows when you hit revenue targets.

Now, to make sure that $500,000 target is realistic, I need to understand your customer value. What does a typical customer spend with you? For example, does the average person buy one pair of shoes for $80, or do they come back and spend $200 over time?

TURN 4 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I'm not totally sure about the exact numbers, but I think most people spend around $120 to $150 when they buy from us. Our shoes are in the mid-range price point - not super cheap but not luxury either. As for coming back, some customers do buy again but I don't have a good handle on how much they spend over time. Is that the kind of information you need?

AGENT:
That's helpful! I'll model using $135 average order value (midpoint of your range) and assume customers buy 1.3 times over a year based on typical footwear benchmarks. That projects to roughly $175 customer value over time.

Here's the math: $500,000 / $175 = approximately 2,900 new customers needed to hit your revenue target.

Now, what budget are you working with to bring in those customers?

TURN 5 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
That sounds reasonable - I like that you can break it down into actual customer numbers like that. We have about $250,000 to spend on marketing this year. Does that seem like enough to get those 2,900 customers?

AGENT:
Let me check the math on that: $250,000 / 2,900 customers = $86 per customer to acquire.

That's tight but achievable for online footwear. Market benchmarks typically show $60-120 per customer for mid-range shoes, so you're right in the realistic range. You'll need efficient targeting and good conversion rates to hit it, but it's definitely doable.

This completes our economics foundation - we know you need 2,900 customers at $86 each to hit your $500K goal. Now let's define who those customers should be. 

What does your ideal shoe customer look like? Think about age, lifestyle, or what drives them to buy shoes online versus in stores.

TURN 6 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
That's a relief that it's in the right range! I was worried we might not have enough budget.

For our customers, I'd say they're mostly people in their 20s to 40s who are pretty busy and like the convenience of shopping online. A lot of them are working professionals who want comfortable but stylish shoes for the office or casual wear. We also get people who are active - not serious athletes, but folks who walk a lot or are on their feet during the day. I think they choose us online because they want good quality shoes without having to spend a whole day shopping at the mall.

AGENT:
Great profile! Busy professionals aged 20-40 who value convenience and want comfortable, stylish shoes without the mall hassle. That's a solid foundation.

To sharpen this for targeting, what specific behaviors or interests would help us find more people like your best customers? For example, do they shop at certain retailers, follow particular brands, or have hobbies that indicate they'd value your shoes?
