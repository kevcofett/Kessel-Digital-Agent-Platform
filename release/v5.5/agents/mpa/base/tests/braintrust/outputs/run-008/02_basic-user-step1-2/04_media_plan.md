# Media Plan Output: Basic User - Steps 1-2 Completion

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve? For example, are you looking to get a certain number of new customers, hit a revenue target, or grow your customer base by a specific amount?

Turn 2:
Perfect! So your main objective is $500,000 in additional revenue this year, plus growing your customer base since you're newer online.

To measure success, we need one primary number to track. Since you mentioned both revenue and customers, which would be the main way you'd measure if this campaign succeeded - total dollars in new sales, or the number of new customers you bring in?

Turn 4:
That's helpful! I'll model using $135 average order value (midpoint of your range) and assume customers buy 1.3 times over a year based on typical footwear benchmarks. That projects to roughly $175 customer value over time.

Here's the math: $500,000 / $175 = approximately 2,900 new customers needed to hit your revenue target.

Now, what budget are you working with to bring in those customers?

Turn 6:
Great profile! Busy professionals aged 20-40 who value convenience and want comfortable, stylish shoes without the mall hassle. That's a solid foundation.

To sharpen this for targeting, what specific behaviors or interests would help us find more people like your best customers? For example, do they shop at certain retailers, follow particular brands, or have hobbies that indicate they'd value your shoes?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Exactly right! Revenue is your primary success measure, and more customers typically follows when you hit revenue targets.

Now, to make sure that $500,000 target is realistic, I need to understand your customer value. What does a typical customer spend with you? For example, does the average person buy one pair of shoes for $80, or do they come back and spend $200 over time?

Turn 5:
Let me check the math on that: $250,000 / 2,900 customers = $86 per customer to acquire.

That's tight but achievable for online footwear. Market benchmarks typically show $60-120 per customer for mid-range shoes, so you're right in the realistic range. You'll need efficient targeting and good conversion rates to hit it, but it's definitely doable.

This completes our economics foundation - we know you need 2,900 customers at $86 each to hit your $500K goal. Now let's define who those customers should be. 

What does your ideal shoe customer look like? Think about age, lifestyle, or what drives them to buy shoes online versus in stores.
