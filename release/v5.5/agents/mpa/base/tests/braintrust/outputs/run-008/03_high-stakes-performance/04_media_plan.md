# Media Plan Output: High-Stakes Performance Campaign

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've given me a strong foundation - $2M budget for 50,000 merchants with $850 LTV. Let me quickly check the math: $2M ÷ 50,000 = $40 per merchant acquisition. With $850 LTV, that projects to a healthy 21x LTV/CAC ratio, which is excellent for fintech.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 50,000 new merchants? For example, are you focused on total payment volume processed, revenue growth, or market expansion into new verticals?

Turn 2:
Perfect! So your primary objective is ARR growth to $45M, which means you need $17M in new ARR. That's a solid 61% growth target.

Let me validate the math: 50,000 new merchants generating $17M new ARR implies $340 average revenue per new merchant annually. Does that align with your merchant revenue expectations, or should we adjust either the merchant count or ARR target?

Also, I noted your geographic expansion interest - we'll dive deep into that in our geography step, but it's smart thinking on CAC efficiency.

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Your $40 CAC target is aggressive but achievable with the right strategy. Based on fintech benchmarks, small business payment platforms typically see CACs ranging from $35-80, so you're targeting the efficient end of that spectrum.

The geographic expansion strategy is smart - mid-tier cities often deliver 20-30% lower CACs due to reduced competition and lower CPMs. However, your core metros likely have higher merchant values that justify premium acquisition costs.

Here's what I'm seeing: if you can average $35 CAC in expansion markets and accept $45-50 CAC in core metros where LTV is higher, you could potentially exceed your 50,000 target while staying within budget.

Before we model the geographic split, I need to understand your success measurement. You mentioned ARR growth as the primary objective - what's your primary KPI for tracking campaign performance? Is it new merchant acquisitions, or do you have a specific metric like cost per activated merchant or revenue per acquisition?

Turn 4:
Excellent - cost per activated merchant is a solid primary KPI since it directly connects to revenue realization. The 90-day revenue tracking adds important quality validation.

So we have your complete Step 1 foundation:
- **Objective**: $45M ARR (up from $28M) 
- **Primary KPI**: Cost per activated merchant
- **Target**: 50,000 activated merchants at $40 average CAC

Your efficiency target of $40 per activated merchant with $850 LTV creates a strong 21x ratio, giving you excellent unit economics flexibility.

Now for Step 2 - let's validate if this efficiency is realistic across your market mix. You mentioned core metros versus expansion markets. What percentage of your current merchant base comes from major metros versus mid-tier cities, and do you see meaningful LTV differences between these segments?

Turn 5:
That's valuable insight - higher retention in mid-tier markets often compensates for lower individual LTV through more predictable revenue streams.

Let me model your blended economics:

**Current Mix Impact on Target CAC:**
- Major metros: $950 LTV supports up to $45-50 CAC (19-21x ratio)
- Mid-tier cities: $725 LTV supports up to $35-40 CAC (18-21x ratio)

Your $40 blended target works well if you can shift the mix. If you move from 75/25 to roughly 60/40 metro/mid-tier split, you could:
- Accept $45-50 CAC in metros (justified by higher LTV)
- Target $30-35 CAC in expansion markets
- Achieve $40 blended average while potentially exceeding 50,000 merchants

The better retention in mid-tier markets actually strengthens this approach - more predictable cash flows support the ARR growth objective.

Does a 60/40 geographic split feel realistic for your expansion capacity, or should we model a different ratio?

Turn 6:
Perfect - 65/35 is a more realistic expansion pace that doesn't overstretch operations. Let me model that split:

**65/35 Geographic Economics:**
- Major metros: 32,500 merchants at $47 CAC = $1.53M
- Mid-tier cities: 17,500 merchants at $32 CAC = $560K
- **Total: 50,000 merchants for $2.09M**

That's slightly over your $2M budget, but gives you flexibility to optimize the mix. If you hit $30 CAC in expansion markets, you'd have $35K buffer - or you could acquire 51,000+ merchants within budget.

The retention advantage in mid-tier markets makes this even more compelling for sustainable ARR growth.

Your economics look solid and realistic. Ready to move to Step 3 and define your target merchant audience? Understanding who you're acquiring in each geographic segment will help us build the most efficient targeting strategy.

What does your ideal merchant profile look like - business size, industry verticals, transaction patterns?

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Excellent targeting foundation. Your $10K-100K monthly processing sweet spot with professional services, retail, restaurants, and e-commerce gives us clear audience segments to work with.

The preference for consistent monthly volume over seasonal/project-based businesses is smart - it aligns perfectly with your ARR predictability goals and should improve that retention advantage you mentioned in mid-tier markets.

A few key audience questions to sharpen our targeting:

Within that $10K-100K processing range, do you see different performance by business maturity? For example, do established businesses (3+ years) versus newer businesses (under 2 years) show different LTV or activation patterns that would affect how we prioritize them?

Turn 8:
That's smart segmentation - the 70/30 weighting toward established businesses balances proven performance with growth opportunity capture.

The 15-20% higher LTV for 3+ year businesses is significant. That means:
- Established: ~$1,000 LTV (metros) / $850 LTV (mid-tier)  
- Newer: ~$800 LTV (metros) / $650 LTV (mid-tier)

This actually strengthens your geographic strategy since established businesses in mid-tier markets ($850 LTV) still support healthy CACs around $40-45, while newer businesses there need tighter efficiency.

One more audience dimension: Within your core verticals (professional services, retail, restaurants, e-commerce), do you see meaningful performance differences that would affect targeting priority? Or should we treat them as equally viable segments for acquisition?

Turn 9:
Excellent insight - business maturity as the primary filter with vertical as secondary makes perfect strategic sense. A mature restaurant with proven cash flows and payment patterns is indeed more valuable than a new professional services firm still finding its footing.

So we have strong audience definition:
- **Primary**: 3+ year businesses, professional services/e-commerce focus
- **Secondary**: 3+ year retail/restaurants + newer professional services/e-commerce  
- **Geographic split**: 65% major metros, 35% mid-tier expansion markets
- **Processing volume**: $10K-100K monthly sweet spot

This gives us multiple audience segments to test and optimize across your geographic expansion strategy.

Ready for Step 4 - Geography? You mentioned expanding from major metros into mid-tier cities where competition is lighter. Which specific metro markets are your current strongholds, and what mid-tier markets are you considering for expansion?
