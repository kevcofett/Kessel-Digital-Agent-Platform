# Media Plan Output: Full 10-Step Media Planning

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your efficiency target. $750K ÷ 15,000 = $50 per customer acquisition. That's tight but achievable for home decor if we're strategic about targeting and channels.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 15,000 new customers - is this purely about growth, market expansion, or hitting a particular revenue target?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect! Your math checks out - 15,000 customers at $450 LTV projects to $6.75M revenue. With a $50 CAC against $450 LTV, you're targeting a healthy 9x LTV/CAC ratio, which is excellent for sustainable growth.

Now let's validate if $50 CAC is realistic for home decor. Based on industry benchmarks, furniture and home decor typically sees CACs ranging from $40-80 depending on average order value and channel mix. Your target is on the aggressive end but achievable with tight audience definition and efficient channel selection.

One key question for your economics: What's your typical customer's first purchase value? This matters because if customers spend $200+ on first order, your immediate payback helps fund acquisition even before the full $450 LTV materializes.

Turn 3:
Excellent - that $180-200 first purchase gives you strong unit economics. You're nearly breaking even on first order, then the additional $250-270 in subsequent purchases over 12-18 months creates healthy profit margins.

This confirms your $50 CAC target is realistic. With immediate payback of $180-200 against $50 acquisition cost, you have 3.6-4x first-order ROAS, which provides solid working capital for continued acquisition.

Your customer journey from small decor items to larger furniture pieces is perfect for retention marketing and suggests we should think about acquisition channels that reach people in different stages of home decorating projects.

Perfect - we've established realistic economics. Now let's move to Step 3: Audience. 

Who is your ideal customer? Think about demographics, but also behaviors - are they new homeowners, frequent redecorators, or specific life stage transitions?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Great profile! Women 30-55, homeowners, $60K+ income with strong social media engagement around home design. The life transition triggers are gold - new homeowners and major life changes create high-intent purchase windows.

Let me size this audience. In the US, women 30-55 represent about 27% of the population (~90M people). Filtering for homeowners (65% rate) and $60K+ income (roughly 60% of homeowners) gives us approximately 35M potential customers nationally.

Your "seasonal refreshers" vs "life transition" segments likely behave differently - refreshers may respond to seasonal campaigns while transition customers need different messaging and timing.

Before we get more specific with behavioral signals, what geography are you thinking? Are you targeting nationally, or focusing on specific regions or metro areas?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Smart thinking! That dual approach makes perfect sense - small decor items have better shipping economics for national reach, while furniture benefits from metro concentration.

Your current metros (Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Phoenix) are excellent choices - growing populations, strong household income growth, and good logistics infrastructure. These four metros alone represent about 20M people, so roughly 2.7M women in your target demo.

$750K ÷ 15,000 = $50 CAC remains your target, but we might see different efficiencies:
- Metro furniture campaigns: potentially $45-55 CAC due to shipping advantages  
- National decor campaigns: potentially $40-50 CAC with broader reach

This suggests we could allocate maybe 60% budget to metro markets for full product range, 40% to national for decor items. Does that directional split align with how you think about your product mix and margins?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 6:
Perfect! Higher margins on decor (40-45% vs 30-35%) plus higher frequency creates a great foundation for that allocation strategy.

So we have:
- 60% budget ($450K) for metro markets: full product range targeting your proven geographies
- 40% budget ($300K) for national decor: leveraging better margins and shipping economics

This projects to roughly 9,000 customers from metro campaigns and 6,000 from national decor campaigns to hit your 15,000 target.

Your economics are solid - we've established realistic efficiency targets. Now let's move to Step 5: Budget refinement.

Within that $450K metro budget, would you want to weight it equally across Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, and Phoenix, or do you have performance data suggesting some markets outperform others?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 7:
Absolutely - that allocation is strategically sound. Weighting toward proven performers (Dallas/Atlanta at 60% combined) while maintaining growth investment in Denver and Phoenix shows smart portfolio thinking.

Breaking down your $450K metro budget:
- Dallas: $135K (30%) 
- Atlanta: $135K (30%)
- Denver: $112.5K (25%)
- Phoenix: $67.5K (15%)

This gives each market sufficient scale to optimize while reflecting performance reality. Dallas and Atlanta get enough budget for aggressive scaling, Denver maintains momentum, and Phoenix gets meaningful investment to mature.

Perfect - we've established realistic budget allocation. Now let's move to Step 6: Value Proposition.

Given your customer segments - life transition customers vs seasonal refreshers - how do you typically message to each? Do they respond to different value propositions around home transformation?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 8:
Excellent differentiation! Your messaging strategy perfectly aligns with customer psychology:

**Life Transition:** "Making it yours" taps into identity and emotional attachment - perfect for higher-value, longer consideration purchases. These customers are investing in their future, not just buying products.

**Seasonal Refreshers:** "Quick impact" messaging matches their faster decision-making and trend awareness. They're already engaged decorators looking for inspiration.

This creates a clear value proposition framework:
- **Transformation messaging** for furniture and major pieces (life transitions)
- **Refresh messaging** for decor and accessories (seasonal updates)
- **Before/after social proof** for both, but especially refreshers

Your insight about entry points is crucial - refreshers start small but convert to larger purchases over time, while transition customers may start big but need more nurturing.

Perfect - we have strong value propositions for each segment. Now let's move to Step 7: Channels.

Given your Pinterest/Instagram-savvy audience and dual messaging strategy, what channels are you currently using, and where do you see the biggest opportunities?

Turn 9:
Excellent foundation! You're already in the right visual channels for your audience. Let me map this to your budget and segments:

**Current strong performers:** Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and Google Search are perfect starts. **Biggest opportunity:** Pinterest is absolutely critical for your audience - home decor is one of Pinterest's top categories.

**Channel allocation suggestion:**
- **Meta (40% - $300K):** Split between transformation campaigns (life transitions) and refresh campaigns (seasonal)
- **Google Search + Shopping (25% - $187.5K):** High-intent keywords plus visual product showcase
- **Pinterest (20% - $150K):** Inspiration-driven targeting, perfect for both segments
- **YouTube (10% - $75K):** Home decorating content, especially for life transition customers
- **Connected TV (5% - $37.5K):** Brand awareness during evening "nesting" hours

This mix leverages visual platforms where your audience discovers ideas while capturing high-intent search traffic.

Which of these feels most aligned with where you want to focus first - scaling Pinterest or testing YouTube/CTV?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 10: Risks

Turn 10:
Perfect strategic thinking! Pinterest first makes complete sense - your customers are already there in discovery mode, and $150K gives you meaningful scale to optimize both seasonal refresh campaigns and life transition targeting.

Pinterest also bridges your dual approach beautifully:
- **Seasonal content** performs exceptionally well (spring refresh, fall cozy, holiday decorating)
- **Life transition boards** (first apartment, new home, nursery design) capture high-LTV customers
- **Shopping features** let you capture users from inspiration to purchase

Your phased approach is smart - nail Pinterest performance, then layer in YouTube for deeper storytelling and CTV for broader awareness once you've maximized the high-intent platforms.

Great - we have a solid channel strategy. Now let's move to Step 8: Measurement.

Beyond tracking your $50 CAC target, how do you currently measure campaign success? Are you looking at first-purchase ROAS, lifetime value, or other metrics to optimize toward your best customers?
