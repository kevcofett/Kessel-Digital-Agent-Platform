# Media Plan Output: Brand Building with Limited Data

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect setup - natural supplements expanding to West Coast with $500K for brand awareness. Since this is a new market launch, we'll model using industry benchmarks where needed.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with this brand awareness campaign? For example, are you looking to drive a certain number of new customers, reach a specific revenue target, or establish market presence for future growth?

Turn 3:
Perfect! 5,000 new customers is a solid target to work with. Let me check the math:

$500K ÷ 5,000 = $100 per customer

That implies $100 cost per acquisition, which is actually quite reasonable for natural supplements. Industry benchmarks typically show $80-150 for wellness products, so you're right in the sweet spot.

I'll model using this target and we can refine anytime. Now for the economics - to assess if $100 per customer is profitable, what's the typical value of a new customer to GreenLeaf? For example, does an average customer spend $60 on their first order, or do they typically purchase $150+ over their first few months?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Got it - establishing market presence and driving new customer discovery. To model this effectively, I need to understand how you'll measure success as a number.

Since you want people to discover and try your products, would your primary success metric be new customers acquired, or are you thinking more about reach metrics like how many people become aware of GreenLeaf Wellness? 

For a $500K brand awareness campaign in a new market, we need to set either a customer acquisition target or an awareness/reach target to determine if your budget can achieve meaningful impact.

Turn 4:
Let me model this based on your estimates:

First order value: ~$75-80
3-month customer value: ~$200-250

At $100 cost per customer with $75 first-order value, you'd lose ~$25 on initial purchase but break even around the second order. If customers hit $200+ over 3 months, you're profitable within the first quarter.

This is actually conservative for supplements - industry benchmarks typically show 2-3x LTV/CAC ratios work well. Your implied ratio of 2-2.5x suggests viable economics.

I'll model using $225 average 3-month customer value and move forward. You can refine these numbers anytime as you gather more data.

Perfect - we've established your objective (5,000 new customers) with realistic efficiency ($100 CAC). Now let's define your target audience. Who is most likely to discover and try GreenLeaf Wellness supplements? What does your ideal West Coast customer look like?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Excellent - health-conscious millennials and Gen Z (25-40) who are already engaged in wellness purchasing. The West Coast is indeed ideal for this audience with higher wellness adoption rates.

To size this audience properly, I need a few more targeting signals. Beyond age and wellness interest, are there other characteristics that define your best customers? For example:

- Income level (since they're "willing to invest in their health")
- Lifestyle factors (fitness enthusiasts, organic food buyers, etc.)
- Current supplement usage patterns

This helps us estimate how many people in California, Oregon, and Washington actually match your ideal customer profile within that 25-40 age range.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Perfect! That gives us a clear profile: active, wellness-engaged millennials/Gen Z with $60K+ income who are current supplement users looking to upgrade.

Let me model the audience size across your three states:

California, Oregon, Washington combined have roughly 50 million people. Filtering for:
- Ages 25-40: ~30% = 15M people
- Income $60K+: ~40% = 6M people  
- Active wellness lifestyle: ~25% = 1.5M people
- Current supplement users: ~60% = 900K people

So approximately 900K people match your ideal customer profile across the West Coast. At 5,000 target customers, you'd be reaching about 0.6% of your addressable audience - very achievable for a brand awareness campaign.

Now for geography - you mentioned California, Oregon, and Washington. Should we weight the budget equally across all three states, or do you want to prioritize based on population size or market opportunity?

Turn 7:
Smart approach - California's market is massive compared to Oregon and Washington.

Based on population and your ideal audience size:
- California: ~75% of your addressable market
- Washington: ~15% 
- Oregon: ~10%

I'd recommend allocating budget proportionally:
- California: $375K (75%) - targeting ~3,750 customers
- Washington: $75K (15%) - targeting ~750 customers  
- Oregon: $50K (10%) - targeting ~500 customers

This gives you meaningful presence in all three states while maximizing impact in California's larger market. The $100 per customer efficiency holds across all three states.

Does this geographic split align with your market entry strategy, or would you prefer to adjust the allocation between states?

Turn 8:
Excellent! We've established strong geographic allocation that maximizes impact while maintaining West Coast presence.

Now for your budget structure - you have $500K total with the geographic split we defined. For a brand awareness campaign targeting new customer acquisition, you'll need to balance upper-funnel brand building with lower-funnel conversion activities.

Typically for market entry campaigns, I see 60-70% allocated to acquisition channels that drive immediate trials, and 30-40% to brand awareness channels that build longer-term recognition.

Given your goal of getting people to discover and try GreenLeaf products, what feels right to you - leaning more toward immediate customer acquisition, or investing more heavily in building brand awareness first for future growth?

Turn 9:
That 70/30 split is smart for your situation. Here's the math:

Acquisition: $350K (70%) - targeting direct customer acquisition
Brand Awareness: $150K (30%) - building recognition for future growth

$350K ÷ 5,000 customers = $70 per customer from acquisition channels

This is actually excellent - acquisition channels typically convert more efficiently than blended campaigns, so $70 CAC from performance channels is very achievable for supplements. The $150K in brand awareness creates the foundation for future campaigns to perform even better.

You're right that being completely unknown argues for some brand investment, but prioritizing acquisition gives you immediate market feedback and customer data to optimize from.

Now let's define your value proposition. When these health-conscious West Coast consumers discover GreenLeaf Wellness, what key message will make them choose you over existing supplement brands they might already know?

Turn 10:
That's a strong value proposition for the West Coast market! "Pure, natural wellness you can trust" with third-party testing and organic sourcing directly addresses the transparency and quality concerns of your target audience.

Your positioning works well because it's:
- Specific (third-party testing, organic sourcing)
- Credible (verifiable claims)
- Relevant (West Coast wellness values)
- Differentiated (many supplement brands can't claim true clean ingredients)

This messaging foundation will perform well across both your acquisition channels (immediate trust-building) and brand awareness channels (long-term positioning).

Perfect - we've now established your outcomes, economics, audience, geography, budget allocation, and value proposition. We have a solid foundation: 5,000 customers across the West Coast, $70 acquisition efficiency, clean ingredient differentiation.

Ready to move to channels? Based on your health-conscious millennials/Gen Z audience and acquisition-focused budget, which digital channels do you think would be most effective for reaching supplement buyers who care about natural ingredients?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Excellent instincts! Instagram, Facebook, and Google Search are indeed core channels for supplement acquisition. Let me break down what typically works best:

**Your suggested channels are spot-on:**
- Meta (Instagram/Facebook): $40-60 CAC typical for wellness brands
- Google Search: $50-80 CAC for supplement keywords
- Both excel at reaching health-conscious millennials/Gen Z

**Additional high-performing channels for supplements:**
- Google Shopping: Visual product discovery, $45-70 CAC
- YouTube: Wellness content integration, $60-90 CAC  
- Pinterest: Recipe/wellness inspiration, $50-75 CAC

**For your $350K acquisition budget, I'd recommend:**
- Meta: 40% ($140K) - best audience targeting for wellness
- Google Search: 35% ($122K) - captures purchase intent
- Google Shopping: 15% ($53K) - product discovery
- YouTube: 10% ($35K) - educational content

This mix should easily achieve your $70 CAC target. Does this channel allocation align with where you think your customers discover supplements?

Turn 12:
Great question! You're absolutely right to question Pinterest vs YouTube for your audience.

YouTube is definitely the better choice for your target customers. Here's why:

**YouTube advantages for supplements:**
- Millennials/Gen Z watch wellness, fitness, workout content regularly
- Educational format perfect for explaining supplement benefits
- Influencer partnerships with fitness/wellness creators
- Video testimonials and ingredient explanations work well
- $60-90 CAC range is achievable

**Pinterest reality check:**
- More female-skewed, older demographic than your core audience  
- Better for recipe inspiration than supplement discovery
- Longer conversion cycle, harder to track to purchase
- $70-100+ CAC, often less reliable attribution

Your instinct is spot-on - stick with YouTube in that 10% allocation ($35K). Your health-conscious millennials/Gen Z are much more likely to discover supplements through fitness YouTubers and wellness content than Pinterest boards.

So our final acquisition mix:
- Meta: $140K (40%)
- Google Search: $122K (35%) 
- Google Shopping: $53K (15%)
- YouTube: $35K (10%)

This should comfortably hit your $70 CAC target. Ready to discuss measurement?
