# Media Plan Output: Mass National Campaign - Simplicity Test

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect - you've given me a strong foundation. You want to drive awareness for your new snack line launch with an $8M budget. Brand lift studies will measure success.

To model this effectively, I need to understand your specific awareness target. Are you aiming for a certain percentage of brand awareness lift among your target audience, or do you have a reach goal like hitting X million people with Y frequency?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Great - 80% reach at 3-4 frequency is a solid awareness foundation for a product launch. That's approximately 120-140 million adults 18-54 nationally, which is ambitious but achievable with your $8M budget.

Let me check the efficiency: $8M targeting ~140M people projects to roughly $0.06 per person reached. For national brand campaigns, that's realistic when leveraging high-reach channels effectively.

Now for economics - since this is brand-focused rather than direct response, how do you typically think about the value of awareness? For example, do you have a sense of what percentage of aware consumers eventually try the product, or what a trial is worth to FreshBite?

Turn 3:
Got it. I'll model using 12% trial conversion based on your estimate - that's reasonable for snack launches. At 80% reach of adults 18-54, that projects to approximately 14-17 million potential triers from this awareness campaign.

Your $8M investment breaks down to roughly $0.47-$0.57 per potential trier, which is efficient for brand building in CPG. This gives you solid foundation metrics to refine as you gather real performance data.

Step 1 complete - we have clear awareness objectives with realistic efficiency targets. 

Moving to Step 2: Since you're investing $8M in broad awareness, the key economic question is sustainability. What does a typical new customer need to spend over time to justify this level of brand investment? Even a rough range helps ensure we're building toward profitable growth.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 4:
Perfect. At $27.50 average first-year value and healthy margins, your economics look solid. Even with conservative assumptions, you're building a sustainable foundation.

$8M / 14-17M potential triers = $0.47-$0.57 per trier. If 50-60% of triers become customers spending $27.50, that's $13.75-$16.50 in first-year value per dollar invested - strong return for brand building.

Economics complete - your efficiency targets are realistic and the investment math supports long-term growth.

Now for Step 3: With adults 18-54 being quite broad for an $8M budget, let's sharpen your audience definition. Are there specific segments within that range who are most likely to try premium snacks? For example, household income levels, lifestyle factors, or current snacking behaviors that would help us focus your reach more effectively?

Turn 5:
Excellent refinement. Adults 25-45, $50K+ HHI, with premium/health-conscious shopping behaviors is much more strategic than the original 18-54 broad target.

This focused audience is approximately 45-50 million people nationally - still substantial reach but with much higher conversion probability. Your $8M now projects to $0.16-$0.18 per person reached, which gives you more frequency and better memorability.

At 80% reach of this refined audience (36-40M people) with higher trial rates from better targeting, you're looking at potentially 5-7M triers instead of the broader 14-17M estimate. Quality over quantity approach.

One key audience question: Within your 25-45, $50K+ premium snack buyers, are there geographic concentrations we should prioritize? Major metros, specific regions, or does this audience distribute fairly evenly across the US?

Turn 6:
Smart geographic focus. Top 25 DMAs contain about 70% of your premium target audience, so allocating 60-70% of budget there is efficient. That's roughly $5M for major metros, $3M for broader national presence.

Your refined targeting is much stronger: 25-45, $50K+ HHI, premium snack buyers, concentrated in top metros. This audience is approximately 30-35 million people with your geographic weighting.

$8M / 30-35M = $0.23-$0.27 per person reached. At 80% reach, that's 24-28 million people reached at 3-4 frequency - excellent memorability for a launch.

Geography complete. Step 4 is audience depth, but you've already defined the key signals well. 

Moving to Step 5: With $8M and your metro concentration strategy, how are you thinking about budget pacing? Is this a concentrated launch burst over 2-3 months, or sustained presence over 6+ months? Launch timing affects both reach efficiency and competitive response.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Perfect timing strategy. A 4-month launch with front-loaded spend creates optimal awareness momentum for shelf availability.

I'd recommend a 50/30/15/5 budget allocation: $4M months 1-2 for launch surge, $2.4M month 3, $1.2M month 4, $400K holdback for optimization. This maintains 70% reach in peak months, then 40-50% reach for sustaining presence.

Your pacing aligns well with CPG launch best practices - heavy initial investment when product availability is fresh, then sustained reminder frequency.

Step 5 complete. Moving to Step 6: For your value proposition, what's the key message that differentiates this snack line? Is it the premium quality, health benefits, convenience, taste, or something else? This will drive which channels and creative approaches work best for your launch strategy.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
"Premium snacking without compromise" is a strong value proposition that speaks directly to your target's mindset. The taste-plus-quality positioning differentiates well in a crowded snack market and justifies the premium price point.

This messaging works perfectly with your audience of health-conscious, higher-income consumers who already shop premium brands. The "elevated everyday indulgence" angle gives people permission to feel good about their snack choice.

Step 6 complete - your value proposition aligns well with your audience and economic targets.

Moving to Step 7: Now for channel strategy. Given your awareness objective, 4-month launch timeline, metro focus, and premium positioning, which channels are you considering? Your $8M budget and reach goals suggest a mix of high-impact awareness channels would work best.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 9:
Excellent channel instincts. Video-centric approach is perfect for showcasing product quality and premium positioning. Your 60-70% on TV/CTV is smart for reach efficiency.

Breaking down your $8M: $5M for TV/CTV gets you solid national reach with metro concentration. $1.5M on YouTube provides targeted frequency with your demo. $1.5M on display/video extends touchpoints and supports retargeting.

This mix should easily hit your 80% reach at 3-4 frequency targets. TV/CTV delivers mass awareness, YouTube adds targeted engagement, display provides sustained presence across your 4-month timeline.

For your premium positioning, this video-heavy approach lets consumers see and understand the quality difference - critical for justifying premium pricing.

One optimization note: Consider holding 15-20% of TV/CTV budget for month 2 allocation based on week 1-2 performance data. Your front-loaded strategy benefits from real-time adjustments.

Ready for Step 8 measurement, or do you want to refine the channel allocation first?
