# Media Plan Output: Precision Targeting with Complex Attributes

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a precision media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Your setup is sophisticated - $1.5M for 2,500 qualified HNW leads with strong audience definition and CRM modeling assets. Let me start with outcomes.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 2,500 qualified leads? For example, are you targeting a specific AUM increase, new client conversions, or pipeline value over a defined timeframe?

Turn 2:
Excellent. So your primary objective is $250M in new AUM over 18 months, with qualified leads as the leading indicator. Your conversion math is solid: 2,500 MQLs × 10% average conversion × $1.2M AUM = $300M potential, giving you buffer above the $250M target.

$1.5M budget ÷ 2,500 leads = $600 cost per qualified lead. Given HNW targeting complexity and your quality requirements, this efficiency is ambitious but achievable with precise execution.

How do you currently measure a "qualified lead" - what specific criteria make an MQL qualified for your sales team?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Perfect. Your MQL definition combines asset verification, intent signals, and demographic scoring - exactly what's needed for HNW precision targeting.

At $600 per qualified lead, you're in aggressive but realistic territory for verified HNW prospects. Typical wealth management acquisition costs $400-800 per qualified lead based on targeting precision.

Given the 7+ year client lifecycle and referral network effects you mentioned, what's your target client lifetime value? This helps validate whether $600 per acquisition supports healthy unit economics for long-term growth.

Turn 4:
Strong unit economics: $6K acquisition cost for $100K+ LTV creates a healthy 16:1+ ratio before referral multipliers. That validates your aggressive $600 per qualified lead target.

I'll model using $120K LTV (conservative 7-year estimate) with referral upside noted separately. You can refine this as we build the program.

Your economics are solid - $6K per client acquisition against $120K+ lifetime value gives you substantial room for optimization and scale. The 18-month AUM target of $250M is achievable with disciplined execution.

Now let's define your precision audience. You mentioned executives and business owners, 45-65, approaching retirement or liquidity events. What specific professional titles or business situations create the highest-converting prospects for LuxeFinance?

Turn 5:
Excellent targeting precision. Your highest converters fall into three clear segments:

1. **Pre-retirement executives**: C-suite at $50M+ revenue companies, 2-5 years from retirement
2. **Liquidity event owners**: Recent exits or planning exits within 18 months  
3. **Pre-IPO equity holders**: Executives with significant equity positions needing tax optimization

This creates multiple intent signals we can target: retirement planning research, business exit preparation, equity compensation tax strategies, and estate planning for windfalls.

Given these three distinct segments have different urgency levels and research behaviors, should we weight the audience strategy toward one segment, or pursue all three equally? For example, pre-IPO executives may have higher urgency than pre-retirement executives.

Turn 6:
Smart prioritization. 40% liquidity events, 35% pre-IPO equity, 25% pre-retirement aligns budget with urgency and conversion velocity.

Based on your weighting:
- $600K targeting liquidity events (1,000 MQLs)
- $525K targeting pre-IPO equity (875 MQLs) 
- $375K targeting pre-retirement (625 MQLs)

This allows premium placements for high-urgency segments while capturing pre-retirement prospects cost-effectively.

You mentioned focusing on top HNW DMAs. Among NYC, SF, LA, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Denver, Miami, Dallas, DC - do any of these markets show stronger performance for specific segments? For example, does SF over-index for pre-IPO equity due to tech concentration?

Turn 7:
Excellent geographic strategy. SF/Seattle tech concentration for pre-IPO, Miami's tax-advantaged relocations, and NYC's financial services density create natural segment-market fits.

Your allocation by segment and geography:
- **Pre-IPO equity** ($525K): 60% SF/Seattle ($315K), 40% other DMAs ($210K)
- **Liquidity events** ($600K): Heavy weight NYC/Miami/LA for exit diversity  
- **Pre-retirement** ($375K): Distributed across all DMAs for consistent performance

With your 50K CRM clients, you have exceptional first-party data for lookalike modeling. How clean is that data for the three segments we've identified? Can you separate recent liquidity clients from pre-retirement clients to build distinct lookalike audiences?

Turn 8:
Strong first-party foundation: 15K liquidity event clients and 20K pre-retirement clients give you substantial lookalike seeds. The LinkedIn and company data adds crucial B2B targeting layers.

For the mixed 15K records, company timing analysis could surface pre-IPO patterns - clients who joined around major tech IPO windows likely fit that segment.

Your lookalike strategy would be:
- **Liquidity events**: 15K seed audience for highest-urgency targeting
- **Pre-retirement**: 20K seed audience for broader, cost-effective reach  
- **Pre-IPO**: Smaller custom audience from company/timing analysis plus prospecting

Given your sophisticated audience definition across three segments, ten DMAs, and first-party lookalikes, what's your current view on total addressable market size? Are we looking at hundreds of thousands or millions of potential prospects across these segments?

Turn 9:
Perfect TAM sizing: 200-300K total addressable prospects creates healthy reach without waste. Your segment breakdown aligns with urgency levels:

- **Pre-retirement**: 150K prospects (largest pool, longer consideration)
- **Liquidity events**: 50-75K prospects (medium pool, high urgency) 
- **Pre-IPO equity**: 25-50K prospects (smallest pool, highest intent)

At 2,500 target MQLs from 250K average TAM, you're targeting 1% market penetration - aggressive but achievable with precision execution and your strong first-party data advantage.

Your audience strategy is solid: distinct segments with clear intent signals, geographic concentration matching segment strengths, and lookalike modeling from 35K+ clean CRM records.

Now let's validate your $1.5M budget allocation. You mentioned 40% liquidity events, 35% pre-IPO, 25% pre-retirement. Should we also consider budget reserves for testing, creative development, or audience expansion as we learn what works best?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 11:
Excellent seasonal strategy. Chasing urgency cycles while maintaining consistent presence maximizes efficiency:

**Q1 Allocation** (fresh exits active):
- Liquidity events: 45% ($585K)
- Pre-IPO equity: 35% ($455K) 
- Pre-retirement: 20% ($260K)

**Q4 Allocation** (tax planning urgency):
- Pre-IPO equity: 40% ($520K)
- Liquidity events: 35% ($455K)
- Pre-retirement: 25% ($325K)

**Q2-Q3**: Baseline 40%/35%/25% allocation

Your budget framework is solid: $1.3M core media with $200K testing reserve, seasonal weighting toward urgency, and geographic concentration matching segment strengths.

Now let's define your value proposition for each segment. What's the core message that resonates most with liquidity event prospects versus pre-IPO equity holders? The messaging sophistication needs to match their specific financial situations.

Turn 12:
Perfect value proposition differentiation. Each segment has distinct emotional triggers and technical needs:

**Liquidity Events**: "Protect and grow your windfall" 
- Emotional: Fear of mistakes with new wealth
- Rational: Tax-efficient transfer, sustainable income, legacy building
- Tone: "You built it, we'll preserve it"

**Pre-IPO Equity**: "Maximize your IPO outcome"
- Emotional: Optimizing paper wealth conversion 
- Rational: 83(b) elections, AMT planning, post-lockup strategy
- Tone: Technical precision, timing-focused

**Pre-retirement**: "Secure your transition" 
- Emotional: Lifestyle preservation anxiety
- Rational: Accumulation to preservation shift, income generation
- Tone: Long-term security, measured planning

Your messaging sophistication matches audience expectations. Each segment gets relevant technical depth without overwhelming complexity.

With value propositions defined, let's move to channels. Given your $600 CAC target and HNW precision requirements, which channels currently perform best for LuxeFinance? LinkedIn seems obvious for B2B executive targeting, but what else drives qualified HNW leads?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 10:
Smart reserve allocation. $200K flexibility (13% of total) gives you solid testing capacity and segment reallocation ability based on performance data.

Your seasonality insight is crucial:
- **Q4**: High competition for tax planning, premium CPMs
- **Q1**: Fresh liquidity event prospects from prior year exits
- **Pre-IPO timing**: Often tied to company-specific IPO calendars, not seasonal

Revised budget framework:
- **Core media**: $1.3M across segments  
- **Testing/optimization**: $200K reserve
- **Creative development**: Separate line item for segment-specific messaging

For the $1.3M core spend, do you want to maintain the 40%/35%/25% segment allocation, or should we weight more heavily toward Q1 liquidity targeting and Q4 pre-IPO equity when tax urgency peaks?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 13:
Strong channel portfolio with proven performance. Your current mix aligns perfectly with HNW targeting:

**LinkedIn**: $400-500 CPL, unmatched B2B precision for executives
**Programmatic**: Effective for lookalikes + premium financial publisher context  
**CTV**: Brand awareness in target DMAs during premium programming
**Podcast sponsorships**: Engaged finance audiences + host credibility
**Sponsored content**: High-converting but premium pricing

Given your $600 target CPL and seasonal budget weighting, I'd recommend:

- **LinkedIn**: 40-45% of budget (proven efficiency, all segments)
- **Programmatic**: 25-30% (lookalike expansion, retargeting)  
- **CTV + Podcasts**: 15-20% (brand awareness, credibility)
- **Sponsored content**: 10-15% (premium placements for highest-intent)

Should we weight LinkedIn heavier for pre-IPO and liquidity segments where job/company data creates targeting advantages, while using CTV and podcasts more for the broader pre-retirement audience?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 14:
Perfect channel-segment alignment. Your approach maximizes targeting precision where it matters most:

**High-urgency segments** (Liquidity + Pre-IPO):
- LinkedIn: 50% (job triggers, company data, real-time identification)
- Sponsored content: Heavy allocation for active researchers
- Programmatic: Lookalike expansion from LinkedIn conversions

**Pre-retirement segment**:
- CTV/Podcasts: 40% (efficient reach, brand building for longer cycle)
- LinkedIn: 30% (still valuable but not urgency-dependent)
- Lower sponsored content allocation

This creates a tiered strategy: precision targeting for immediate opportunities, broader reach for pipeline development.

For measurement, how do you currently track attribution across these channels? With HNW prospects researching across multiple touchpoints over weeks or months, clean attribution becomes critical for budget optimization and proving campaign incrementality.

Turn 16:
Excellent testing framework. Geo-holdouts across your DMA concentration create clean measurement:

**Test design**: 6-7 DMAs with full channel mix vs 3-4 control DMAs with digital-only
**Measurement**: Lift in qualified leads, lead quality scores, and downstream conversion rates
**Timeline**: 90+ day attribution windows to capture full HNW consideration cycles

Your intake form enhancement is brilliant - adding financial event timing validates segment targeting effectiveness:
- "Recent liquidity event in past 12 months?" 
- "Planning business exit in next 18 months?"
- "Holding pre-IPO equity positions?"

This connects channel performance to actual segment fit, not just lead volume.

**Risk assessment**: What's your biggest concern about this media plan? Is it the aggressive $600 CPL efficiency target, the seasonal budget shifting, or something else? Identifying the highest-risk elements helps us build contingencies and early warning indicators.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 15:
Your attribution challenge is common with HNW prospects - 3-6 month consideration cycles across premium channels create complex journeys that last-click severely under-represents.

**Immediate improvements:**
- Extend attribution windows to 90+ days for HNW cycles
- Implement first-touch and multi-touch models alongside last-click
- Add "How did you first hear about us?" to intake forms
- Use LinkedIn's view-through attribution for brand touchpoints

**Advanced solutions:**
- Marketing mix modeling to understand true channel contribution
- Incrementality testing through geo-holdouts or matched market tests
- CRM journey mapping connecting early touchpoints to closed clients

Given your sophisticated audience and premium channel mix, I'd recommend starting with extended attribution windows and intake form improvements, then building toward incrementality testing.

The key insight: CTV and podcasts likely drive significant awareness that LinkedIn converts. Measuring only last-click will systematically underinvest in awareness channels.

What testing approach interests you most for validating true channel performance - geo-based holdouts or matched market comparisons?
