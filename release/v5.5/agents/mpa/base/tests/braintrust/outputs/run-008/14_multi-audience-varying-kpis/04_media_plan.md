# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience with Different KPIs Per Segment

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! This is a sophisticated multi-segment challenge - I love the strategic clarity you've brought. We'll cover our ten areas with special attention to how each segment's distinct objectives drive different approaches.

Your three-segment structure is smart: Conquest for future consideration, In-Market for immediate leads, and Loyalty for customer retention. Each will need different success metrics and efficiency targets.

Let's start with Segment 1 - Conquest/Awareness. You want to shift consideration among competitor vehicle owners for purchases 2-3 years out. With roughly $1.58M allocated (35% of $4.5M), what's your primary KPI for measuring awareness success? 

Are you thinking brand lift percentage, reach against target audience, aided/unaided awareness metrics, or consideration shift tracking?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Brand lift percentage on aided awareness and purchase consideration is exactly right for this long-term play. Tracking consideration shift versus their current brand is the real measure of success.

The 6+ frequency target makes sense for awareness building. Let me run some quick math on your Conquest segment:

$1.58M budget targeting competitor vehicle owners with 6+ frequency - this suggests we're looking at a fairly targeted audience rather than broad reach. 

For brand lift studies to show statistical significance, you typically need to reach 200,000+ people in your target audience. At 6+ frequency, that implies roughly 1.2M+ impressions minimum.

What's your target volume for this segment? Are you thinking about it as:
- Total people reached (like 300K competitor owners)
- Brand lift percentage target (like +15% consideration lift)
- Or geographic coverage (percentage of your market areas)?

This will help me assess if your budget can deliver the reach and frequency needed for measurable brand lift.

Turn 4:
$150-200 CPL for qualified leads who show for test drives is solid automotive economics. Let me check your math:

$2.03M / $175 average CPL = approximately 11,600 qualified leads

That lands right in your 10,000-13,500 range and feels realistic for in-market automotive shoppers.

However, I want to flag something: automotive lead quality varies dramatically by source. Your $150-200 blended CPL suggests you're tracking to actual test drives, not just form fills. That's smart - raw automotive leads can run $25-50 but conversion to showroom visits drops significantly.

Based on automotive benchmarks, $150-200 for qualified leads (people who actually show up) is achievable but requires tight audience targeting to active shoppers. You'll need to focus heavily on high-intent signals - recent vehicle searches, trade-in research, financing pre-qualification activity.

Quick reality check: Are you confident in that $150-200 target, or should we model a more conservative $200-250 range to ensure the plan is achievable? Better to under-promise and over-deliver on lead volume.

What's your sense of the target - aggressive but doable, or does it feel tight?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent targeting. 250K-300K competitor owners with +12-15% aided awareness lift and +8-10% consideration lift are realistic but meaningful targets.

Let me check the math: $1.58M reaching 275K people at 6+ frequency = approximately $5.75 per person reached. That's achievable for automotive awareness campaigns, especially with geographic concentration around your dealerships.

Your instinct about prioritizing high-volume metros is smart - you need that 200K+ threshold for statistical significance on brand lift measurement.

Quick efficiency check: Based on automotive awareness benchmarks, $5-7 per person reached with 6+ frequency is typical for competitor conquest campaigns. Your implied $5.75 sits right in that range.

Now for Segment 2 - In-Market Lead Generation. You've allocated roughly $2.03M (45% of $4.5M) for active vehicle shoppers browsing Autotrader and Cars.com. 

What's your target volume for this performance segment? Are you thinking total leads generated, or do you have a cost-per-lead target in mind based on your dealership economics?

Turn 5:
Perfect mindset - aggressive but doable with tight qualification beats padded numbers every time. Your focus on 30-60 day purchase window and willingness to reallocate mid-flight shows strong performance discipline.

$2.03M targeting 11,600 qualified leads at $175 average CPL is a solid efficiency target for automotive. Trade-in research and financing pre-qual signals will be crucial for hitting that range.

Now for Segment 3 - Loyalty/Retention. You've allocated roughly $900K (20% of $4.5M) for existing customers due for service, approaching trade-in, or with expiring contracts.

This segment has completely different economics since you already own the relationship. What's your target efficiency here? Are you thinking:

- Cost per service appointment booked
- Cost per trade-in inquiry generated  
- Or a blended retention action cost across all three behaviors?

The math will be very different from conquest and lead gen since you're marketing to your own customer base.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
$25-40 per retention action feels very reasonable for existing customer reactivation. Let me check the math:

$900K / $32.50 average = approximately 27,700 retention actions

That lands perfectly in your 22,500-36,000 range and reflects strong existing relationship economics.

Your cost breakdown makes sense - service appointments at the lower end since maintenance is habitual, trade-in inquiries higher due to bigger purchase decision, lease renewals in the middle. That's realistic customer behavior modeling.

27,700 retention actions from your existing customer base is achievable, especially with email, direct mail, and targeted digital to known customers. The key will be timing these actions to service intervals, lease expiration dates, and trade-in cycle windows.

Now I have a complete picture of your three-segment approach:
- Conquest: 275K competitor owners, brand lift focus, $1.58M
- In-Market: 11,600 qualified leads at $175 CPL, $2.03M  
- Loyalty: 27,700 retention actions at $32.50, $900K

All three efficiency targets are realistic based on automotive benchmarks. Ready to move to audience definition, starting with your Conquest segment's competitor vehicle owners?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Great question on data sourcing - this is where automotive conquest gets complex. You have several options, each with different precision levels:

**Third-party automotive data** (most precise): Companies like Polk/IHS, Experian, or TransUnion can provide actual vehicle registration data. You can target specific makes/models/years within your geography. This is the gold standard but most expensive - probably $8-12 CPMs.

**Platform automotive audiences** (good precision): Meta and Google have automotive intender audiences based on search/browse behavior, but these mix current owners with shoppers. Less precise than registration data but more scalable.

**Lookalike modeling** (broadest reach): Build from your existing customer base to find similar profiles, then exclude your current customers. Reaches beyond just competitor owners to include conquest-ready profiles.

For 275K reach at 6+ frequency with $1.58M budget, you'll likely need a mix. Pure registration data might be too narrow and expensive for that volume.

Which approach feels most aligned with your conquest strategy - paying premium for precise competitor owner targeting, or casting a wider net with lookalikes plus automotive behavioral signals?

Turn 8:
That's smart strategic thinking. Let me check the math on your hybrid approach:

**60% to registration data**: $948K at $10 CPM average = ~95M impressions
At 6+ frequency, that reaches approximately 158K precise competitor owners

**40% to lookalikes/behavioral**: $632K at ~$4 CPM = ~158M impressions  
At 6+ frequency, that reaches approximately 263K broader automotive prospects

**Total blended reach**: ~420K people (with some overlap to manage)

Your instinct to focus registration data on Toyota/Honda owners at 3+ years is excellent - that's exactly when trade consideration peaks. The 60/40 split gives you precision where conversion probability is highest, then fills volume with broader signals.

One consideration: You'll want to carefully manage audience overlap between the two approaches to avoid frequency waste. Platform exclusion lists will be crucial.

The blended approach should deliver your 275K+ reach target while keeping qualified competitor owners as the core audience. This feels like the right balance of precision and scale.

Ready to move to geography? You mentioned 50-mile dealership radius with broader reach in metros where you have multiple locations - how do you want to prioritize those markets?

Turn 9:
Absolutely - that geographic prioritization is textbook smart media strategy. Let me break down why this works:

**Metro markets (60% allocation)**: Multiple dealerships create inventory depth and sales capacity to handle increased consideration. Higher frequency (6+) is justified because you can actually fulfill the demand you generate.

**Standalone markets (40% allocation)**: Lower frequency (4-5) acknowledges limited inventory/capacity while still maintaining brand presence. This prevents waste from driving consideration you can't convert.

The approach also strengthens your brand lift study - concentrating higher frequency in metros gives you better statistical power where you have the most business impact.

From a media buying standpoint, this creates natural campaign segmentation:
- Metro campaigns: Premium frequency, full targeting precision
- Extended radius: Efficient reach extension, broader audiences

One tactical note: The metro concentration will also improve your attribution measurement since you'll have cleaner geographic control groups for incrementality testing.

Now let's tackle budget allocation. You've got $4.5M total with your 35%/45%/20% split across segments. Within each segment, how do you want to think about budget allocation - by geography first, or should we consider other factors like seasonality or brand priorities?

Turn 10:
Perfect sequencing - geography as foundation, seasonal overlay for timing, then performance-driven brand optimization. That's exactly how sophisticated automotive campaigns should be structured.

Your seasonal weighting is spot-on for automotive:
- Q2/Q3 (40%): Spring selling season captures pent-up demand
- Q4 (35%): Year-end incentives and tax considerations drive urgency  
- Q1 (25%): Maintenance period, but still important for early movers

Smart call on avoiding brand fragmentation upfront. Three brands across three segments across multiple geos creates too many micro-budgets to optimize effectively. Let performance data reveal which brands resonate best in each segment, then reallocate accordingly.

This gives you $1.8M in peak season, $1.575M for year-end push, $1.125M for Q1 maintenance - solid budget concentration when automotive demand is highest.

Now for value proposition development. Each segment needs different messaging:
- Conquest: Long-term brand consideration 
- In-Market: Immediate purchase drivers
- Loyalty: Relationship and convenience

What's your core value proposition for the Conquest segment? What should shift competitor owners' consideration toward your brands over their current vehicles?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 11:
"Experience the difference" is perfect positioning for long-term consideration building. You're absolutely right about aspirational over transactional - Toyota/Honda owners are methodical researchers who value proof over promises.

The multi-brand convenience angle is smart differentiation - most competitors can't offer that breadth under one roof. Service excellence and resale value messaging directly addresses their core concerns about reliability and total cost of ownership.

Your messaging hierarchy makes sense:
- Primary: Superior ownership experience 
- Proof points: Service excellence, multi-brand convenience, resale values
- Emotional hook: Aspirational future consideration vs. immediate pressure

This positions you as the thoughtful choice for their next purchase cycle rather than just another dealer pushing inventory.

For In-Market messaging, the approach needs to flip completely - immediate purchase drivers and urgency. What's your value proposition for active shoppers who need to decide in the next 30-60 days? 

Are you thinking inventory availability, financing advantages, or something else that creates immediate purchase urgency?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 12:
Excellent approach - inventory depth removes the biggest friction point for ready buyers. "Largest selection in the region" with "Over 2,000 vehicles in stock" directly addresses choice paralysis and positions you as the one-stop solution.

Your financing messaging hits the two pain points active shoppers face: rate competitiveness and approval speed. "Get approved in minutes, not hours" is particularly strong since financing delays kill momentum in automotive sales.

Smart restraint on urgency tactics. In-market shoppers are indeed skeptical of manufactured pressure. Manufacturer rebates feel more legitimate than dealer-created urgency because they're time-bound by external forces, not sales manipulation.

Your In-Market value prop hierarchy:
- Primary: Inventory depth and selection
- Secondary: Competitive financing speed  
- Urgency: Legitimate manufacturer incentives vs. artificial pressure

This builds trust while driving action - exactly what converts skeptical but ready buyers.

For Loyalty messaging, you're talking to customers who already trust you. What's your retention value proposition? Is it convenience, exclusive benefits, or relationship continuity that brings existing customers back for service and trade-ins?

Turn 13:
Perfect loyalty positioning - "We know your vehicle's history" and "Your trusted service team" leverage the relationship equity you've already built. That personal continuity is impossible for competitors to replicate.

The exclusive benefits approach is smart psychology - "Customer-only pricing" and "Priority scheduling" make them feel like VIPs rather than just another service appointment. Early access to new models and exclusive trade-in events create genuine insider value.

Your convenience stack removes friction at every touchpoint:
- One-call scheduling eliminates phone tag
- Pick-up/delivery removes logistics hassle  
- Known service history speeds diagnostics

This creates switching costs through convenience rather than contracts - much stronger retention driver.

Your Loyalty value prop hierarchy:
- Primary: Relationship continuity and personal service
- Secondary: Exclusive customer benefits and insider access
- Tactical: Friction-free convenience at every touchpoint

This makes staying easier than leaving while reinforcing their smart initial choice.

Now let's move to channels. With three distinct objectives and audiences, each segment needs different channel strategies. For Conquest awareness building among competitor owners, what channels are you thinking? Connected TV, display, social - or do you have other ideas for reaching that 275K target with 6+ frequency?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 14:
Excellent channel strategy for long-term consideration building. Your video-first approach aligns perfectly with awareness objectives, and the budget allocation makes strategic sense:

**CTV (40-45%)**: Smart anchor choice. Premium environment, precise automotive data targeting, and perfect for showcasing ownership experience stories. Great reach efficiency for your competitor owner segments.

**Traditional TV (25-30%)**: Solid for Toyota/Honda owner demographics who still consume linear TV. High-viewership periods maximize reach while building broad brand familiarity.

**YouTube (15-20%)**: Perfect contextual targeting - people already researching automotive content are ideal prospects. Longer-form content lets you tell the complete ownership experience story.

**Display/Social (10-15%)**: Smart frequency completion. Programmatic display with automotive overlays reinforces video messaging, while Facebook/Instagram extends reach.

Your creative insight is crucial - "These guys seem different" positioning builds future consideration without immediate pressure. Video content can showcase service experience, multi-brand convenience, and customer testimonials that plant long-term seeds.

For In-Market lead generation, the channel strategy needs to flip to high-intent, immediate-action focused. What are you thinking for reaching those 11,600 qualified leads? Search, automotive sites, social conversion campaigns?
