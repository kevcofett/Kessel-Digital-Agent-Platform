# Media Plan Output: Timeline Compression

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your business outcome. You mentioned acquiring 25,000 new customers - is customer acquisition your primary objective, or are you also focused on revenue growth, brand awareness, or retention alongside acquisition?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Customer acquisition as your primary objective makes sense for an expansion phase. 

Now let me check the math on your targets: $1.2M ÷ 25,000 customers = $48 per customer acquisition cost (CAC). With your $180 LTV, that projects to a 3.75x LTV/CAC ratio, which is excellent for fashion retail where 3-4x is typically considered strong.

Your $48 CAC target is achievable but requires disciplined execution. Fashion retail benchmarks typically show $35-65 CAC depending on channel mix and audience precision.

Is this $48 efficiency realistic based on any previous campaign results, or would you like me to model what it takes to hit this target?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Perfect - that customer profile gives us strong targeting signals. Fashion-forward women 25-45 with $120+ AOV and 90-day repeat behavior are high-value indicators we can optimize toward.

Your audience definition reveals an important efficiency opportunity: if premium customers have $120+ first purchase versus $85 average, their immediate value is 40% higher. This suggests we can potentially spend more than $48 to acquire these premium customers while maintaining healthy unit economics.

Let me ask about geography to size your addressable market. When you say "urban areas," are you thinking major metros like NYC, LA, Chicago, or broader urban/suburban markets? And are you planning national expansion or focusing on specific regions where Urban Essentials already has brand recognition?

This will help us assess if 25,000 customers is realistic within your target geography at $48 CAC.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - your $45-55 testing range validates the $48 target nicely. Let me model what consistent execution at this efficiency requires.

At $48 CAC across $1.2M budget, you need:
- Monthly pace: ~2,083 customers at $100K spend
- Weekly pace: ~481 customers at $23K spend
- Daily pace: ~68 customers at $3.3K spend

To hit this consistently while scaling 5-10x from current volume, you'll need:

**Audience precision**: Tight targeting to maintain efficiency as spend increases
**Channel diversification**: Instagram/Google alone may not provide 25K customers at $48 CAC
**Creative refresh cycles**: Fashion demands frequent creative updates to prevent fatigue

The biggest risk is audience saturation - your current small-scale audiences may exhaust quickly at higher spend levels.

Before we dive into audience strategy, I need to understand your customer definition. When you say "quality new customers," what makes a customer valuable beyond the $180 LTV? Are there specific demographics, purchase behaviors, or engagement patterns that define your ideal customer?

Turn 6:
Smart allocation strategy. Let's model this:

**Coastal markets (70% = $840K budget)**
- Target: 17,500 customers at $48 CAC
- Established audiences and brand recognition support this efficiency

**Tier 2 expansion (30% = $360K budget)**  
- Target: 7,500 customers at $48 CAC baseline
- Acceptable range: $48-63 CAC for market development
- If CAC runs $60, that's 6,000 customers with $360K

This gives you 23,500-24,500 total customers, hitting your 25K target while building expansion market intelligence.

The tier 2 investment is smart - Austin's fashion scene alone could support 1,000+ premium customers annually once established.

Now let's define your value proposition for targeting. You mentioned "unique pieces" and premium pricing. What specifically differentiates Urban Essentials from competitors like Revolve, ASOS, or local boutiques? This shapes how we position in creative and which audiences respond best.

Turn 7:
Perfect positioning - "accessible luxury with genuine scarcity" is a compelling value prop that justifies premium pricing and drives urgency.

Your curated, limited-quantity model creates natural FOMO that should perform well in paid media. The exclusivity angle differentiates clearly from mass-market competitors and appeals directly to your fashion-forward target who values uniqueness.

This positioning also supports higher CACs for the right customers - someone seeking exclusive pieces is less price-sensitive than someone comparison shopping on Amazon.

Now we're ready for channel strategy. Based on your objectives, audience, geography, budget, and value proposition, I recommend a three-tier approach:

**Tier 1 (60%): Meta platforms** - Visual-first format perfect for fashion, strong targeting for women 25-45, proven performance in your coastal markets

**Tier 2 (30%): Google** - Capture high-intent searches for "unique fashion," "designer pieces," brand terms

**Tier 3 (10%): Testing allocation** - TikTok for younger segments, Pinterest for fashion discovery, influencer partnerships

Does this channel mix align with where you see your customers discovering and engaging with fashion brands?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Excellent geographic strategy - major metros for scale plus tier 2 expansion for growth. Let me model your addressable market.

Your target metros represent approximately:
- Tier 1 (NYC, LA, Chicago, SF, Boston, Seattle): ~35M total population
- Tier 2 (Austin, Denver, Portland, Nashville): ~8M total population
- Combined: ~43M population base

Filtering for women 25-45 in urban areas with fashion/premium spending behavior, you're looking at roughly 2-3% of total population, or ~900K-1.3M addressable audience. 

25,000 customers represents about 2-3% penetration of this addressable market, which is very realistic for a well-executed campaign.

The geographic mix also supports your premium customer strategy - coastal metros typically show higher AOVs and faster adoption of fashion trends.

Now for budget allocation: would you prefer to weight spend toward your established coastal markets for efficiency, or invest more heavily in tier 2 expansion markets for growth, even if CAC runs higher initially?

Turn 9:
Those are critical operational concerns that could derail performance. Let me outline risk mitigation strategies:

**Creative Production Risks:**
- High: Creative fatigue at 5-10x spend increase could spike CACs 50%+
- Mitigation: Establish 2-week creative refresh cycles, build content bank of 50+ assets per quarter
- Consider partnerships with fashion photographers/UGC creators for scalable content flow

**Inventory Coordination Risks:**
- High: Overselling limited pieces damages brand trust and scarcity positioning
- Medium: Underselling due to conservative ad spend leaves revenue on table
- Mitigation: Real-time inventory feeds to ad platforms, automated campaign pausing at low stock levels

**Testing Strategy for Risk Management:**
- Month 1-2: Start at 50% planned spend to test creative refresh cycles and inventory coordination
- Month 3-4: Scale to full spend once operational systems prove reliable
- Reserve 15% of testing budget specifically for creative production experiments

Given these operational complexities, would you prefer to phase the rollout more conservatively - perhaps targeting 20K customers in months 1-8, then 5K in months 9-12 once systems are proven? This reduces execution risk while still hitting your annual target.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Excellent - that channel mix leverages your proven Instagram performance while expanding strategically.

For measurement, I recommend focusing on three key metrics:

**Primary KPI: Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** - Track by channel and geography against your $48 target, with flexibility up to $63 for tier 2 markets

**Secondary: Customer Quality Score** - Weight AOV, repeat purchase rate, and engagement to identify premium customer sources worth higher CACs

**Leading Indicator: Cost per Landing Page View** - Early signal for creative fatigue and audience saturation before CAC deteriorates

I'd also recommend incrementality testing on Meta to validate true performance beyond platform attribution, especially as you scale spend significantly.

Now for testing strategy: Given your limited-quantity model, we should test scarcity messaging ("Only 23 left"), exclusivity angles ("Not available anywhere else"), and styling inspiration content. 

What's your biggest concern or risk as we move into execution? Creative production capacity, inventory coordination with campaigns, or something else entirely?

Turn 10:
Perfect - that phased approach protects your brand positioning while building operational confidence.

Let me summarize your complete media plan:

**OUTCOMES & ECONOMICS**
- 25,000 new customers at $48 CAC ($1.2M budget)
- 3.75x LTV/CAC ratio with $180 customer value
