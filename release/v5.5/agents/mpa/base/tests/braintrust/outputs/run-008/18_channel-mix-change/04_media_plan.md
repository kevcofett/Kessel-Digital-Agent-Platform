# Media Plan Output: Channel Mix Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You mentioned awareness goals - what specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with this launch? For example, are you aiming for trial purchases, brand consideration, or something else that translates to business results?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Trial purchases is a strong, measurable objective. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success as a number. 

What's your primary KPI for this campaign? For example, are you tracking number of trial customers, total trial purchases, or something else specific that defines success?

Turn 3:
Excellent! 500,000 trial customers is a clear, measurable target. Let me run the math on your efficiency:

$3M budget ÷ 500,000 customers = $6 per trial customer

That's an impressively efficient target for a new product launch. Based on typical CPG benchmarks, trial acquisition often runs $15-30 per customer for new brands, so your $6 target is quite aggressive.

To assess if this is achievable, I need to understand your unit economics. What's the average value of a trial customer to you - either their first purchase value or their projected lifetime value if you have that data?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using $10 average trial purchase and $50 first-year LTV based on your estimates - you can refine these anytime.

At $6 acquisition cost against $50 LTV, that projects to an 8.3x LTV/CAC ratio, which is exceptionally strong if achievable. However, your target is indeed aggressive for new product trial - market typically shows $15-25 per trial customer for premium CPG.

To hit your $6 efficiency, we'll need extremely tight audience targeting and high-performing creative that drives immediate purchase intent. The math works if we can execute precisely, but there's limited room for optimization learning.

Given this aggressive efficiency requirement, should we proceed with the $6 target, or would exploring a slightly higher CAC with more budget flexibility make sense for a new product launch?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 5:
$3M ÷ $8 = 375,000 customers or $3M ÷ $10 = 300,000 customers

At $8 per customer, you'd reach 375,000 trial customers with a 6.3x LTV/CAC ratio.
At $10 per customer, you'd reach 300,000 trial customers with a 5x LTV/CAC ratio.

Both scenarios are much more realistic for new product launches while still delivering strong ROI. The $8-10 range gives you essential flexibility for:
- Testing and optimization in weeks 1-4
- Creative iteration based on performance
- Audience expansion when initial segments saturate
- Platform learning without immediate efficiency pressure

I'd recommend modeling at $8 per customer (375,000 trials) as your primary scenario. This hits the sweet spot of ambitious but achievable, giving you room to optimize while still delivering impressive volume to prove the category.

Does 375,000 trial customers at $8 efficiency feel like a strong success story you could take back to leadership?

Turn 6:
Perfect! $8 per customer targeting 375,000 trial customers gives us a solid foundation with built-in flexibility for a new product launch.

Now let's define your target audience. You mentioned health-conscious families - let's get more specific to ensure we reach the right people efficiently.

What are the key characteristics that define your ideal trial customer? For example, are you thinking parents with young children, specific age ranges, income levels, or particular health and wellness behaviors?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 7:
Excellent targeting foundation! Parents 25-54, $75K+ income, with children at home, already shopping organic - that's a well-defined premium audience.

Let me dig into one key behavioral signal: when you say "already shopping organic," are you thinking about people who buy organic across multiple categories (produce, packaged foods, dairy), or more specifically those already purchasing organic snacks and packaged foods? 

This distinction will help us determine if we're targeting established organic snack buyers or expanding from broader organic shoppers into the snack category.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Perfect! Targeting broader organic shoppers who haven't fully committed to organic snacks yet - that's a smart expansion strategy with much larger addressable audience than just current organic snack buyers.

This audience likely shops at multiple retailers beyond just Whole Foods - probably Kroger, Target, Safeway organic sections too, which gives us more touchpoint opportunities.

Now for geography: you mentioned targeting nationally. Are there specific regions where you're seeing stronger organic adoption, or do you want to weight investment toward certain DMAs where your retail distribution is strongest?

Turn 9:
Smart approach! 60% to proven high-adoption markets and 40% to test expansion markets gives you strong performance foundation plus growth opportunity.

$3M × 60% = $1.8M for West Coast and Northeast markets
$3M × 40% = $1.2M for secondary expansion markets

At your $8 per customer target:
- High-adoption markets: 225,000 trial customers
- Expansion markets: 150,000 trial customers

This allocation lets you drive volume efficiently in proven organic markets while building data on expansion potential. The expansion markets also give you learning for future category growth.

Which specific secondary markets are you most interested in testing? Are you thinking Southeast, Midwest, Southwest, or do you have particular DMAs in mind?

Turn 10:
Excellent market selection! Chicago, Minneapolis, Denver, and Atlanta all have strong demographic foundations - educated, higher-income families - with developing organic penetration. You're positioning to capture growth rather than fight for saturated share.

These markets also give you geographic diversity for learning: Midwest food culture, Mountain West health consciousness, and Southeast expansion dynamics.

Now let's finalize your budget allocation. We have:

**High-adoption markets (60% = $1.8M):**
- West Coast: LA, San Francisco, Seattle  
- Northeast: Boston, New York, DC

**Expansion markets (40% = $1.2M):**
- Chicago, Minneapolis, Denver, Atlanta

Does this geographic budget split feel right, or would you adjust the percentage between proven and expansion markets?

Turn 11:
Perfect! Your geographic allocation is locked in at 60% high-adoption markets ($1.8M) and 40% expansion markets ($1.2M).

Now let's develop your value proposition. You're targeting broader organic shoppers who haven't fully committed to organic snacks yet - families who buy organic produce and dairy but may still grab conventional snacks.

What's your core message to convince these families to try your organic snacks? Is it taste, health benefits, ingredient transparency, or something else that differentiates you from both conventional snacks and existing organic options?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 12:
Excellent positioning! "Finally, organic snacks your kids will actually love" perfectly addresses the core barrier - taste compromise. Leading with taste while delivering on health removes the either/or dilemma parents face.

Your "no compromise" message is powerful for organic shoppers who've been disappointed by cardboard-tasting healthy snacks. The ingredient transparency angle reinforces their existing organic values.

This value proposition works beautifully with your targeting - parents already committed to organic in other categories will immediately understand why they need this solution for snacks.

Now we're ready for channel strategy. Based on your objectives (trial purchases), audience (organic-shopping families), geography (national with market weighting), budget ($3M at $8 per customer), and value proposition (taste + health without compromise), what channels are you currently considering or have experience with?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 13:
Great foundation with Facebook and Google experience! For CPG trial with your audience and $8 efficiency target, I recommend this channel mix:

**Primary Channels (70% = $2.1M):**
- **Meta (Facebook/Instagram) - 35%:** Reaches parents in recipe/parenting content, strong lookalike targeting from organic shoppers, visual creative showcasing taste
- **Google Search - 25%:** Captures "organic snacks" and competitor searches when parents actively looking
- **YouTube - 10%:** Recipe integration and family content, builds trust through longer-form storytelling

**Secondary Channels (30% = $900K):**
- **Retail Media (Amazon, Target, Kroger) - 20%:** Reaches shoppers at point of decision, especially strong for trial conversion
- **Connected TV - 10%:** Builds awareness in premium organic markets, reaches cord-cutting families

This mix balances trial efficiency with awareness building. Meta and Search drive immediate response, while YouTube and CTV build brand trust. Retail media captures in-market shoppers.

Does this channel allocation align with how you envision reaching organic-shopping families?
