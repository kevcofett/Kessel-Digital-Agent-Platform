# Media Plan Output: Audience Removal Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start - you've given me excellent strategic context. Let me calculate your implied efficiency: $4M ÷ 15,000 = $267 per test drive. That's ambitious but achievable for premium EV launches in competitive markets.

Before we dive deeper into economics, I need to clarify your primary business outcome. Are those 15,000 test drives the end goal, or do they lead to a specific sales target? Understanding whether success is measured by test drive volume or downstream conversions will shape our entire approach.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Excellent - test drives as your primary KPI makes perfect sense for EV launches where the experience drives purchase decisions. Your 12-15% conversion rate is strong, projecting 1,800-2,250 sales from your 15,000 test drive target.

Now let's validate if $267 per test drive is realistic. Based on automotive benchmarks, premium EV test drive acquisition typically runs $200-400 depending on market competition and targeting precision. Your target sits in the middle range, which is achievable with tight audience definition and efficient channel mix.

One key question for economics: What's the average selling price of your EV? This helps me assess whether your $267 acquisition cost creates healthy unit economics, especially since you'll convert roughly 13.5% of test drives to sales at approximately $3,600 total acquisition cost per sale ($267 ÷ 0.135).

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Perfect! $65,000 MSRP with $5,500 margin minus $3,600 CAC equals $1,900 profit per sale - that's excellent unit economics for a launch campaign. Your LTV upside from service and repeat purchases makes this even stronger.

Your economics are solid and your $267 per test drive target is realistic for premium EV launches. Based on automotive benchmarks, this efficiency is achievable with precise audience targeting across your five target states.

Now let's define your audience more precisely. You mentioned three segments: eco-conscious early adopters 25-45, luxury buyers 45-65 switching from German sedans, and tech enthusiasts focused on features. 

Which of these three segments do you see as your primary target - the one most likely to convert and where you want to focus the majority of your media spend?

Turn 5:
Excellent - BMW 5/3-Series, Mercedes E/C-Class, and Audi A6 owners give us precise targeting signals. The combination of environmental consciousness without luxury sacrifice, tech curiosity, and practical cost considerations creates a compelling value proposition framework.

This completes our economics foundation. Your $267 per test drive target is realistic, unit economics are healthy at $1,900 profit per sale, and your 50/30/20 segment allocation aligns with conversion potential.

Now let's move to geography. You mentioned California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Washington as your target states. Given that luxury German sedan ownership varies significantly by market - with higher concentrations in affluent metros - which specific metro areas within these states are you prioritizing? For example, are you thinking LA and SF in California, or broader statewide coverage?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 4:
Smart prioritization - luxury switchers typically have the highest intent and conversion rates for premium EVs. Your proposed allocation (50% luxury, 30% eco-conscious, 20% tech) aligns well with conversion potential.

Let me model this: $2M for luxury buyers targeting roughly 7,500 test drives at $267 each, $1.2M for early adopters targeting 4,500 drives, and $800K for tech enthusiasts targeting 3,000 drives.

To sharpen our targeting, I need to understand the luxury switchers better. When you say "switching from German sedans," are you primarily thinking BMW 5-Series, Mercedes E-Class, and Audi A6 owners? And what's the key trigger driving their switch - is it environmental concerns, technology features, cost of ownership, or something else?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 6:
Perfect metro focus - those 12 markets capture the highest concentration of your luxury switcher audience and have the EV infrastructure to support adoption. LA, SF, NYC, and Seattle especially over-index for both German luxury ownership and EV readiness.

Your geographic strategy is solid and aligns well with your audience priorities. The metro focus will also help with media efficiency since you can leverage local market dynamics and dealership locations.

Now let's move to budget allocation. You have $4M total with 50% luxury buyers, 30% early adopters, 20% tech enthusiasts. Should we allocate this $4M evenly across your 12 metros, or do you want to weight certain markets more heavily? For instance, California metros might deserve higher investment given their EV adoption rates and luxury vehicle density.

Turn 7:
Excellent allocation thinking! Let me model your proposed weighting:

California (40%): $1.6M across LA/SF/San Diego
NYC metro (25%): $1M  
Texas (15%): $600K across Dallas/Houston/Austin
Florida (12%): $480K across Miami/Tampa/Orlando
Washington (10%): $400K for Seattle/Puget Sound

This projects roughly 6,000 test drives from California, 3,750 from NYC, 2,250 from Texas, 1,800 from Florida, and 1,500 from Washington to hit your 15,000 total.

Your budget allocation aligns perfectly with market opportunity and EV readiness. California and NYC will likely deliver the strongest efficiency given luxury density and environmental mindset.

Now let's develop your value proposition. Based on our discussion, your core message seems to be "luxury without compromise" - premium quality, advanced tech, and smart economics. How do you want to position against those German sedans specifically? Are you the innovative alternative, the smarter choice, or something else?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
Perfect positioning - "This is where luxury is headed" positions your EV as the natural evolution rather than a departure. That removes the perceived risk for luxury switchers who worry about compromising their driving experience.

"Smarter evolution" with "elevated luxury expectations" gives us a strong value proposition framework. Your messaging should emphasize continuity of premium experience plus advancement, not replacement.

Your value proposition is solid and differentiates well against both traditional luxury and other EVs. We've now established strong foundations: realistic economics at $267 per test drive, precise audience targeting with luxury switchers as primary focus, strategic geographic concentration in 12 key metros, and smart budget weighting toward California and NYC.

Now let's move to channels. Given your luxury audience and premium positioning, which media channels do you think will be most effective for reaching BMW, Mercedes, and Audi owners? Are you thinking more traditional premium channels, digital precision targeting, or a mix?
