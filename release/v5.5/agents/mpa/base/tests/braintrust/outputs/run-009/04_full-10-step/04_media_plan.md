# Media Plan Output: Full 10-Step Media Planning

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your efficiency target. $750K ÷ 15,000 = $50 per customer acquisition. That's aggressive but achievable for home decor if we execute precisely.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 15,000 new customers - is this about revenue growth, market share, or something else?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect - revenue growth through customer acquisition is clear. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success.

Your $50 per customer target is tight for home decor. To assess if it's realistic, what's the average order value for a new customer? For example, does a typical first-time buyer spend $150, $300, or something else?

This helps me determine if your $50 acquisition cost leaves room for profitability.

Turn 3:
Excellent. Let me run the math on your unit economics:

$180 AOV × 35% margin = $63 gross profit per new customer

At $50 acquisition cost, that leaves $13 contribution margin ($63 - $50 = $13). That's workable but tight - you're targeting about a 1.3x gross profit to CAC ratio.

This is aggressive for home decor, where typical acquisition costs run $60-80. To hit $50 efficiently, we'll need precise audience targeting and strong channel optimization. The good news is your repeat purchase behavior creates additional lifetime value beyond that first order.

Your Step 1 is complete - revenue growth through 15,000 new customers with $50 target efficiency. Ready to move to Step 3 and define your ideal customer audience?

Turn 4:
Great foundation! Your 30-55, $60K+ homeowners gives us a solid starting point. With your tight $50 efficiency target, we need to get more precise.

Let me dig deeper on the behavioral signals. You mentioned they're active on social media for home inspiration - are you seeing stronger performance from customers who follow specific types of accounts? For example, do they engage more with DIY content, interior design influencers, home renovation shows, or specific home decor brands?

These engagement patterns help us identify the highest-converting segments within your broader demographic.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Perfect - that's a much sharper profile. Your best customers are "style seekers" rather than "DIY makers." They want curated looks and finished solutions.

One more key behavioral signal: Are you seeing patterns around life events that trigger purchases? For example, do customers tend to buy after moving, seasonal changes, holidays, or other specific moments? 

Understanding these purchase triggers helps us time our messaging and identify when people are most ready to spend that $180+ with you.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent insights! Now I have a clear picture of your highest-value segments:

**Primary Audience:** Style-seeking homeowners (30-55, $60K+) who follow design influencers, triggered by moving, seasonal refresh, holidays, or life transitions. They want curated looks, not DIY projects.

Given your $50 efficiency target, I'd recommend focusing on these trigger moments - new homeowners and seasonal refreshers show the strongest purchase intent.

Now let's move to geography. Are you seeing stronger performance in certain regions, or do you have specific geographic markets you want to prioritize? For example, are suburban markets outperforming urban ones, or do certain states drive better results?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Smart observation on suburban performance - homeownership rates and space definitely drive higher conversion.

Your Southeast/Southwest strength aligns with population growth and new construction, which creates those high-intent "new homeowner" triggers we identified.

Given your tight efficiency target, should we concentrate budget on your proven high-performing metros (Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Pacific Northwest) plus other similar growth markets? Or do you need national coverage to hit your 15,000 customer volume target?

Focusing geographically could improve efficiency, but might limit total reach. What's your priority - optimizing for the $50 CAC or ensuring we can reach the full 15,000 customers?

Turn 8:
Smart strategic thinking - efficiency first, then scale. Let me model this:

Focusing on 15-20 key metros (your proven performers plus similar growth markets) typically covers about 40-45% of the US population. With your style-seeking suburban homeowner audience, that's roughly 8-12 million targetable households.

At typical home decor conversion rates, this should easily support 15,000 customer acquisitions - you'd need less than 0.2% market penetration. The geographic focus should actually improve your $50 efficiency by concentrating spend where performance is strongest.

Your Step 4 geography is set: Priority metros in Southeast/Southwest growth markets plus proven performers like Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Pacific Northwest.

Ready for Step 5? Let's talk budget allocation. How do you want to split your $750K - should we weight it toward your strongest seasonal periods (spring/fall), or do you need consistent year-round presence?

Turn 9:
Perfect allocation thinking. Let me break down your seasonal budget:

- Spring (40%): $300K - Peak refresh season
- Fall (30%): $225K - Holiday hosting prep  
- Winter (15%): $112.5K - Holiday decor + new homeowners
- Summer (15%): $112.5K - Outdoor items + moving season

This gives you $37.5K monthly in off-peak periods to capture those life event triggers, while concentrating firepower during high-intent seasons.

At your $50 target efficiency:
- Spring: 6,000 customers
- Fall: 4,500 customers  
- Winter/Summer: 2,250 customers each

Now for Step 6 - your value proposition. You mentioned customers want "curated looks" and "finished solutions." How do you currently differentiate from competitors like Wayfair or West Elm? What's your unique angle that justifies customers choosing HomeStyle Decor?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Excellent positioning - you're the "accessible curator" between mass-market chaos and premium pricing. "Effortless style that doesn't break the bank" perfectly captures your value.

Your room collections and styling bundles are smart differentiators - they solve the paralysis customers feel with too many individual choices. The personal service angle reinforces that you understand their style needs.

This value proposition should resonate strongly with your style-seeking audience who want finished looks without the work or premium cost.

Your Steps 1-6 foundation is solid. Now for Step 7 - channels. Given your audience (design influencer followers), geography (growth metros), and value prop (curated accessibility), what channels are you currently using, and which ones are performing best for customer acquisition?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 11:
Smart channel mix - Meta's visual format is perfect for your styled collections. Let me analyze your current performance and recommend optimization for your $50 target:

**Meta (Facebook/Instagram) - 50-60% allocation ($375-450K)**
Your strongest performer. Focus on carousel ads showcasing room collections and video content featuring styling transformations.

**Google Search - 20-25% allocation ($150-188K)**  
Rising costs but high-intent traffic. Target specific product + room combinations like "modern living room decor" rather than broad terms.

**Influencer Partnerships - 15-20% allocation ($112-150K)**
Scale your mid-tier design influencer strategy. They're perfect for your "accessible curator" positioning.

**Pinterest - 5-10% allocation ($37-75K)**
Test room inspiration pins linking to collections rather than individual products.

What's your current blended CAC across Meta and Google? This helps me assess if we need to shift allocation or find additional channels to hit $50 efficiently.

Turn 12:
Perfect data - you're close but need optimization. Your Meta performance at $45-55 shows the $50 target is achievable with refinement.

Here's your optimized channel strategy:

**Meta (55% - $412K):** Focus on your $45 campaigns, scale back $55+ performers. Emphasize room collections and seasonal triggers.

**Influencer Partnerships (20% - $150K):** Mid-tier design influencers should deliver $40-50 CAC with authentic styled content.

**Google Search (20% - $150K):** Target high-intent, lower-cost long-tail terms. "Affordable modern living room sets" vs "home decor."

**Pinterest (5% - $38K):** Test budget for room inspiration content.

This allocation projects: $412K ÷ $47 avg CAC = 8,766 customers from Meta, plus 6,234 from other channels = 15,000 total.

Ready for Step 8 - measurement? What tracking and attribution systems do you currently have in place to measure these channel performances?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 10: Risks

Turn 13:
You've identified the classic attribution challenge - customers seeing influencer content, then searching, then converting days later. Your current setup likely under-credits influencers and over-credits search.

**Recommended measurement framework:**

**Primary KPIs:** 
- Blended CAC across all channels (your $50 target)
- Monthly new customer acquisition (1,250/month average)
- Customer acquisition by channel with 7-day view, 1-day click windows

**Attribution improvements:**
- UTM tracking for all influencer content
- Branded search lift measurement (track search volume increases after influencer campaigns)
- Customer surveys asking "How did you first hear about us?" 
- Platform-agnostic tracking like Triple Whale or Northbeam for unified view

**Weekly dashboards:** Blended CAC trending, channel performance vs. targets, seasonal pacing against your budget allocation.

This gives you cleaner attribution while keeping measurement practical. You'll better understand true influencer impact and optimize accordingly.

Ready for Step 9 - testing strategy? What would you like to test first to improve that efficiency?

Turn 14:
Excellent testing priorities - you're focusing on your highest-impact areas. Here's your testing roadmap:

**Phase 1 (Months 1-2): Meta Creative Testing**
- Carousel room collections vs. single product ads
- Static styled rooms vs. before/after transformation videos  
- User-generated content vs. professional photography
- Test across your seasonal triggers (new homeowner vs. refresh messaging)

**Phase 2 (Months 2-3): Influencer Structure Testing**
- One-off posts vs. 3-month partnerships
- Single room styling vs. whole-home transformation series
- Influencer-created content vs. brand-provided assets

**Phase 3 (Months 4+): Cross-Channel Testing**
- Influencer content repurposed as Meta ads
- Pinterest idea pins featuring influencer rooms
- Google search ad copy reflecting influencer styling themes

Budget 10% of monthly spend for testing ($6,250/month). Track performance weekly, scale winners immediately.

Ready for our final step - Step 10? Let's identify the biggest risks that could derail your $50 CAC target and plan contingencies.

Turn 15:
You've identified the key operational risks. Let me add a few strategic ones and build contingency plans:

**Major Risks & Contingencies:**

**1. Meta CPM inflation (High probability)**
- Contingency: Shift 10% budget to Pinterest/TikTok if Meta CAC exceeds $60
- Early warning: Monitor CPMs weekly during peak seasons

**2. Attribution gaps causing mis-optimization (Medium probability)**  
- Contingency: Weight decisions toward blended CAC vs. platform-reported CAC
- Implement customer surveys within 30 days for ground truth

**3. Influencer rate inflation (Medium probability)**
- Contingency: Lock 6-month contracts with top performers early
- Build micro-influencer pipeline as backup ($500-1K vs. $2-5K posts)

**4. Creative fatigue/production bottlenecks (High probability)**
- Contingency: User-generated content program + influencer content repurposing
- Build 90-day creative calendar with seasonal themes

**5. Economic downturn affecting home decor spending (Low probability, high impact)**
- Contingency: Pivot messaging to "affordable refresh" vs. "complete makeover"

**Monthly risk review:** Track leading indicators and activate contingencies before CAC exceeds $55.

Your comprehensive media plan is complete! You've got a solid foundation to hit 15,000 customers at $50 CAC efficiently.

Turn 16:
You're absolutely welcome! I'm thrilled this plan feels actionable and strategic rather than just hopeful spending.

You've built something really solid here - your $50 efficiency target is ambitious but achievable with the focused approach we've mapped out. The key will be staying disciplined about the geographic concentration and seasonal weighting while being nimble with your testing and optimization.

A few final thoughts as you execute:
- Trust your blended CAC data over individual platform reporting
- Those micro-influencers could be your secret weapon for scale
- Don't be afraid to pause underperforming tactics quickly to protect your efficiency

Your systematic approach to this planning process tells me you'll execute well. The combination of proven Meta performance, smart influencer scaling, and solid measurement framework should get you to those 15,000 customers.

Best of luck with the campaign launch - you've got this! Feel free to come back if you want to refine anything as you start seeing real performance data.
