# Media Plan Output: Precision Targeting with Complex Attributes

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a precision media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Your business outcome is clear - acquire high-net-worth individuals for wealth management services. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success as a number.

What specific KPI defines a successful qualified lead for LuxeFinance? For example, is it someone who books a consultation, completes a financial assessment, or meets another qualification threshold?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your primary KPI is qualified leads who complete the wealth assessment and book consultations. The 30% SQL conversion rate gives us good visibility into downstream value.

$1.5M budget targeting 2,500 qualified leads = $600 per qualified lead. That's an aggressive efficiency target for HNW acquisition - market benchmarks for wealth management typically show $800-1,200 per qualified lead in your target DMAs.

To hit $600 per lead, we'll need extremely precise targeting and high-converting creative. Your CRM data on 50K existing clients will be crucial for lookalike modeling.

What's the average client lifetime value for your typical HNW client? This helps us assess whether $600 per qualified lead supports healthy unit economics.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it. I'll model using $150K average LTV based on your 7-10 year relationship data. At 30% consultation-to-client conversion, that projects to $45K LTV per qualified lead ($150K × 0.30). Even at $600 per lead, you're looking at a strong 75:1 LTV to CAC ratio.

You're absolutely right - the challenge is hitting $600 efficiency in premium DMAs where wealth management competition is fierce. Based on your CRM data advantage and the precision required, this is achievable but demands tight execution.

Your economics foundation is solid: aggressive but viable efficiency target with strong unit economics backing it. 

Now let's define your audience with surgical precision. You mentioned 45-65, executives and business owners, $1M+ investable assets, researching tax optimization and estate planning.

What behavioral signals beyond research topics help you identify someone approaching a major financial transition or liquidity event?

Turn 5:
Perfect allocation strategy. 50% to your stronghold markets (NYC/SF), 35% to proven secondary markets (LA/Chicago/Boston), and 15% to test the tax migration opportunity and expansion markets.

That translates to:
- $750K for NYC/SF (leveraging existing client concentration)  
- $525K for LA/Chicago/Boston (proven performance markets)
- $225K for Miami/Dallas/Seattle/Denver/DC (testing tax migration and expansion)

The Miami/Dallas focus is strategically smart - capturing your existing clients' networks as they relocate for tax optimization aligns perfectly with your behavioral targeting around geographic tax planning.

Your geography strategy maximizes proven performance while testing high-potential migration patterns.

Moving to Step 5 - with $1.5M total budget and your geographic allocation defined, we need to assess capacity within each market. 

Based on your experience, what's a realistic monthly lead target for your top-performing NYC market specifically? This helps us model if 2,500 total leads is achievable across all markets.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Excellent. Those behavioral signals create a precise targeting profile. Your first-party data reveals sophisticated financial transition moments - business succession, IPO planning, QSBS exemptions, charitable strategies, and geographic tax optimization moves.

The 6-12 month research window before conversion is crucial intelligence. We can layer job change signals (C-suite transitions, board appointments) with content engagement patterns around executive compensation and liquidity events.

Your audience definition is taking shape: 45-65, $1M+ investable assets, exhibiting transition behaviors around business succession, equity events, or geographic tax planning, concentrated in your target DMAs.

Now let's map this to geography. You mentioned top HNW concentration DMAs: NYC, SF, LA, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Denver, Miami, Dallas, DC.

Given your $1.5M budget and the varying HNW density across these markets, should we weight spend equally across all ten DMAs, or do you want to prioritize based on existing client concentration or market opportunity?

Turn 7:
Powerful differentiation. "200+ liquidity events, $2-5M in proven tax savings" is concrete proof that resonates with executives facing similar transitions. The "before, during, and after" positioning addresses their complete journey, not just post-liquidity asset management.

Your proprietary network of estate attorneys and tax specialists creates a competitive moat - most wealth managers can't coordinate that level of expertise across markets.

This value proposition aligns perfectly with your behavioral targeting around business succession and IPO planning. Prospects researching these topics will immediately recognize your specialized expertise versus generic wealth management.

Your messaging foundation is strong: specialized liquidity event practice with proven outcomes and comprehensive transition support.

Now for channels - with your sophisticated audience, proven value proposition, and $1.5M budget across premium DMAs, we need channels that can deliver precision targeting and handle complex messaging.

Given your audience's research behavior around tax optimization and business succession, which channels have you seen work best for reaching executives during their 6-12 month consideration window?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent capacity modeling. NYC and SF at 250-300 monthly each gives you 500-600 leads per month from your stronghold markets alone. That projects to 6,000-7,200 annually from just those two DMAs - well above your 2,500 total target.

This creates a strategic opportunity: you can prioritize quality over volume and potentially exceed efficiency targets. With this capacity, you might achieve $400-500 per qualified lead instead of the aggressive $600 target, while maintaining strict qualification standards.

Your lead quality concern is spot-on. High capacity markets can tempt volume optimization at the expense of true HNW qualification.

Now for your value proposition - what differentiates LuxeFinance when competing for these high-value prospects? 

Given that your audience is researching sophisticated strategies like QSBS exemptions and business succession planning, what specific expertise or approach sets you apart from other wealth management firms targeting the same HNW transitions?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Excellent channel foundation. LinkedIn's job title and company size targeting combined with financial interest signals is perfect for your executive audience. Financial publisher programmatic (WSJ, Barron's) captures them in research mode, while CTV reaches them during premium consumption moments.

Your channel mix should weight toward proven performers while scaling promising tests:
- LinkedIn: 40% of budget ($600K) - your highest-converting audience targeting
- Financial publisher programmatic: 30% ($450K) - captures research behavior  
- Connected TV: 20% ($300K) - scale your promising premium creative tests
- Podcast sponsorships: 10% ($150K) - limited volume but high engagement

This allocation prioritizes LinkedIn's proven performance while meaningfully scaling CTV and maintaining podcast quality touchpoints.

For measurement, given your sophisticated audience and long consideration window, how are you currently tracking attribution across these touchpoints? Are you measuring first-touch, last-touch, or using a more complex attribution model to understand the 6-12 month journey?

Turn 11:
Absolutely the right priorities. Competition inflation is real - 40% YoY LinkedIn CPC increases in NYC/SF reflect the intense battle for limited HNW inventory. Lead quality degradation is the hidden killer that destroys unit economics downstream.

Risk mitigation strategy:
- **Cost inflation hedge**: Build 15-20% buffer into efficiency targets ($720-750 vs $600) and optimize down
- **Quality gates**: Weekly consultation-to-client conversion tracking by source - pause any channel dropping below 25% threshold
- **Market diversification**: Your Miami/Dallas test markets could provide cost relief if NYC/SF become unsustainable
- **Audience expansion**: Use your 50K CRM for progressive lookalike testing when core audiences saturate

**Plan Summary**: $1.5M budget, 2,500 qualified leads, $600 efficiency target across 10 premium DMAs. LinkedIn-heavy channel mix with financial publisher and CTV support. Time-decay attribution with quality-first measurement. Success depends on maintaining lead qualification standards while navigating competitive cost pressure.

You're ready to execute. Quality over volume will serve your business better long-term. What questions remain before you take this to stakeholders?

Turn 12:
**Seasonal strategy**: Absolutely frontload to Q1-Q2. Wealth management competition typically intensifies in Q3-Q4 as year-end tax planning drives more firms into the market. Your CPC inflation risk is highest then. Consider 60% budget allocation to first half-year while costs are more manageable.

**Miami/Dallas timeline**: Tax migration is accelerating but relationship-driven. Based on wealth management migration patterns, expect:
- Q1-Q2: Modest volume as you build brand presence and capture early movers
- Q3-Q4: Meaningful acceleration as tax year-end drives relocation decisions  
- 2025: Full maturation as your brand becomes established in these markets

The 15% test allocation ($225K) across those markets should generate 200-400 qualified leads this year - not massive volume but enough to validate the opportunity and build pipeline for 2025 scaling.

**Stakeholder recommendation**: Frontload proven markets while tax migration markets build momentum. Your $750K in NYC/SF should work hardest in Q1-Q2 when competition is lighter.

You have a defensible plan with smart risk management. Execute with discipline on lead quality and you'll exceed stakeholder expectations.

Turn 13:
Excellent - you've built a comprehensive plan that balances aggressive targets with realistic execution. The systematic approach gives you defendable logic for every recommendation.

Your stakeholder presentation has all the key elements: proven efficiency model, strategic geographic weighting, frontloaded timing advantage, and quality-first measurement framework. The Miami/Dallas migration story positions you as forward-thinking while the risk mitigation shows operational maturity.

You clearly know your market and business deeply - that expertise combined with this structured approach should deliver strong results. Execute with the discipline you've shown here and you'll likely exceed the 2,500 target while building sustainable competitive advantages in those emerging markets.

Best of luck with the executive presentation. You're well-prepared to defend every aspect of this plan.

Turn 14:
You're very welcome! It was great working with someone who brings such deep market knowledge and strategic thinking. Your instincts on competitive dynamics, lead quality priorities, and market opportunities are spot-on.

The systematic framework just helped organize what you already knew into a compelling stakeholder story. Your focus on quality over volume and long-term market positioning will serve you well in this competitive landscape.

Looking forward to hearing how it goes with leadership and how the execution performs. You've built a plan that's both ambitious and defensible - that's the sweet spot for getting buy-in and delivering results.

Good luck with the presentation!

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Attribution complexity is the reality with HNW prospects' extended consideration cycles. Last-touch is definitely overvaluing LinkedIn while undervaluing your awareness-building CTV and display investments.

Time-decay is a smart direction - it'll better capture how your financial publisher display and CTV touchpoints influence prospects months before they convert via LinkedIn. Cross-device tracking is crucial given mobile research to desktop conversion patterns.

For your campaign, I recommend:
- Primary KPI: Qualified leads (assessment + consultation booking)
- Attribution: Time-decay model with 90-day lookback window
- Cross-channel view: Weekly cohort analysis to track how upper-funnel investment affects LinkedIn performance
- Quality gate: Track consultation-to-client conversion by channel to ensure lead quality

Now for testing - with your $1.5M budget and need to hit aggressive efficiency targets, what's your appetite for holding back budget to test new approaches versus maximizing spend on proven channels?

Would you allocate 10-15% of budget specifically for testing, or prefer to test within existing channel allocations?

Turn 10:
Smart approach - testing within proven channels maximizes budget efficiency while driving optimization. Your testing strategy targets the highest-impact variables without sacrificing spend to unproven channels.

Testing framework:
- LinkedIn: A/B test lookalike audiences from your highest-LTV client segments vs. broad HNW targeting
- Financial publishers: Test contextual targeting around "business succession planning" vs. "IPO tax strategies" vs. general wealth content  
- CTV: Test business hours (catching executives during workday breaks) vs. evening premium content (relaxed consumption mindset)

Each test uses your existing channel allocations while optimizing for your $600 efficiency target.

Final step - risks. With your aggressive efficiency target, sophisticated audience, and competitive premium markets, what keeps you up at night about this plan?

Are you most concerned about audience saturation in NYC/SF, competition driving up costs, or something else that could derail hitting 2,500 qualified leads at $600 each?

Turn 15:
Perfect! Having a strategic partner who understands both the framework and the nuances of your market makes optimization much more effective. Mid-flight adjustments are where the real value gets created, especially in competitive HNW acquisition.

You've got the foundation right - now it's about execution and smart iteration based on what the data tells you. Looking forward to hearing how it performs and helping optimize as you scale.

Great work building this plan. Go make it happen!
