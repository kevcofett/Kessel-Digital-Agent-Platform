# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience with Segment-Specific Channels

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build this segmented media plan with you. You've provided excellent strategic context - three distinct segments with clear behavioral differences and a sophisticated understanding of their media consumption patterns.

We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

$5M / 50,000 enrollments = $100 per enrollment - that's your target efficiency across all segments.

Before we dive into segment-specific channel strategies, I need to understand your business objective. Are you optimizing for total enrollments, revenue growth, market share expansion, or something else? This shapes how we weight the segments and measure success.

Turn 2:
Perfect - total enrollments as primary objective with revenue quality as secondary consideration. That's smart strategic thinking.

$5M / 50,000 = $100 blended CAC target, but you're right that segment-level economics will vary significantly. Corporate L&D likely justifies higher acquisition costs given longer LTV.

Since you mentioned unit economics aren't perfectly dialed by segment yet, I'll model using reasonable assumptions based on your business type. We can refine anytime.

For online learning with these segments, I'd estimate:
- Career Changers: ~$150 LTV (premium courses, completion rates)
- College-Age: ~$80 LTV (price-sensitive, higher churn)  
- Corporate L&D: ~$400 LTV (enterprise pricing, multi-seat deals)

This suggests Corporate L&D can support much higher CACs while College-Age needs tight efficiency.

Does this directional LTV modeling align with your business reality, or should I adjust these assumptions?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - updating the model with your refined numbers:

- Career Changers: $190 LTV (using midpoint of your range)
- College-Age: $80 LTV  
- Corporate L&D: $400 LTV (conservative estimate you provided)

This creates very different CAC tolerances:
- Career Changers: ~$63 max CAC (3x LTV ratio)
- College-Age: ~$27 max CAC (tight efficiency required)
- Corporate L&D: ~$133 max CAC (room for premium acquisition)

Your $100 blended target is achievable but requires careful segment weighting. Corporate L&D and Career Changers can subsidize the volume-driven College-Age segment.

Now for Step 3 - you've already provided strong audience definitions. I want to dig deeper into one critical aspect: Within your Corporate L&D segment, are you targeting individual decision-makers or going after specific companies/accounts? This affects whether we build broad reach campaigns or concentrated ABM approaches.

Turn 4:
Perfect - 500 target accounts with multi-stakeholder buying committees. That's classic ABM territory requiring concentrated reach within specific companies rather than broad targeting.

For your Corporate L&D segment, this means we'll need account-based tactics: LinkedIn matched audiences against your target company list, intent data activation, and potentially direct mail or events for key accounts. The buying committee complexity (L&D + HR + IT + Procurement) requires orchestrated touchpoints across multiple decision-makers per account.

This also affects your Corporate L&D volume expectations. With 500 target accounts and complex B2B cycles, this segment likely contributes fewer total enrollments but at much higher values - which aligns with your $400+ LTV.

Now for geography - you mentioned specific preferences by segment. Career Changers indexed to tech hubs, College-Age national with urban/college town emphasis, Corporate L&D national but corporate HQ focused. 

Are there any geographic markets you want to avoid or deprioritize? And should we weight spend toward your highest-performing regions, or is geographic expansion a priority this year?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Excellent - concentrating spend in proven markets makes perfect sense given your enrollment targets and segment economics.

Let me structure this geographically:

**Tier 1 Markets (Heavy Investment):**
- SF Bay Area, Seattle: Strong across Career Changers + Corporate L&D
- Austin, NYC: Strong across all three segments
- Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas: Corporate L&D strongholds

**Tier 2 Markets (Moderate Investment):**
- Boston, Denver: Career Changers + College-Age
- Portland: College-Age focus
- College towns with tech adjacency

This geographic focus should improve efficiency across all segments while supporting your volume goals.

Now for Step 5 - Budget allocation. Given your segment LTVs and geographic priorities, I'm modeling a budget split that balances volume needs with unit economics:

- Corporate L&D: ~$2.0M (40%) - Highest LTV, supports premium CACs
- Career Changers: ~$2.0M (40%) - Volume + solid economics  
- College-Age: ~$1.0M (20%) - Volume play within tight CAC constraints

Does this allocation align with your volume expectations per segment, or should we adjust the weighting?

Turn 8:
Great strategic thinking on both points.

For Career Changers, adding programmatic display for retargeting is smart - these are researchers who need multiple touchpoints. I'd reallocate to:
- LinkedIn Ads (45%)
- Podcast sponsorships (30%) 
- Google Search (15%)
- Programmatic retargeting (10%)

For Corporate L&D search, you're right to question this. B2B buyers do search for "corporate training platforms" and "employee development solutions" - especially during early research phases. I'd adjust to:
- LinkedIn ABM (50%)
- Intent data activation (25%)
- Google Search B2B (15%) - targeting enterprise training keywords
- Direct mail + events (10%)

This captures both the account-based approach and broader search behavior from buying committee members researching solutions.

The creator partnerships for College-Age should drive strong social proof - Gen Z trusts peer recommendations over brand messaging.

Now for Step 8 - Measurement. With three distinct segments and channels, we need segment-specific KPIs. Should we track enrollment attribution by segment, or are you more focused on blended performance with segment insights?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Smart thinking - you're right that College-Age likely has the highest volume potential despite tight economics. Your 35/35/30 instinct makes sense for maximizing total enrollments.

Let me model both approaches:

**Option A (40/40/20): $2M/$2M/$1M**
- Prioritizes efficiency and revenue quality
- May constrain College-Age volume

**Option B (35/35/30): $1.75M/$1.75M/$1.5M** 
- Gives College-Age 50% more budget to drive volume
- Still respects their $27 CAC constraint
- Better aligns with enrollment-first objective

Given your primary goal is hitting 50K enrollments, Option B probably better balances volume potential with economics. The 30% for College-Age = $1.5M budget allows ~55,000 potential enrollments at $27 CAC, giving you volume upside.

I'd recommend starting with 35/35/30 and monitoring segment performance closely. If Corporate L&D shows exceptional efficiency, we can shift budget their direction.

Now for Step 6 - Value propositions. Each segment needs distinct messaging. What's your core value prop for Career Changers versus College-Age learners?

Turn 7:
Excellent value prop differentiation - each speaks directly to segment motivations:

- **Career Changers:** ROI-focused, advancement-driven ("$15K salary boost")
- **College-Age:** Alternative path, speed + savings ("Skip debt, gain skills") 
- **Corporate L&D:** Business impact, scalability ("Upskill 3x faster")

These distinct value props will drive our creative strategy and channel selection.

Now for Step 7 - Channels. Based on your audience behaviors and value props, here's my segment-specific channel strategy:

**Career Changers ($1.75M):**
- LinkedIn Ads (50%): Professional targeting, career advancement messaging
- Podcast sponsorships (30%): Business/tech podcasts, native integration
- Google Search (20%): High-intent "upskill" and certification queries

**College-Age ($1.5M):**
- TikTok/Instagram (60%): Creator partnerships, social proof content
- YouTube (25%): Educational content, testimonials
- Snapchat (15%): Mobile-first, college town geo-targeting

**Corporate L&D ($1.75M):**
- LinkedIn ABM (60%): Account-based targeting, buying committee reach
- Intent data activation (25%): G2, TrustRadius, industry publication pixels
- Direct mail + events (15%): High-value account penetration

Does this channel allocation align with your expectations for each segment?

Turn 9:
Excellent - segment-specific attribution is critical for optimization with such different conversion timelines and CAC targets.

Here's the measurement framework:

**Segment-Specific KPIs:**
- Career Changers: $63 CAC target, 30-60 day conversion window
- College-Age: $27 CAC target, 7-30 day conversion window  
- Corporate L&D: $133 CAC target, 90-180 day conversion window

**Channel Performance Within Segments:**
- LinkedIn performance vs. $63 target for Career Changers
- TikTok creator ROI vs. $27 target for College-Age
- ABM account penetration and pipeline velocity for Corporate L&D

**Cross-Channel Attribution:**
- Multi-touch attribution for Career Changers (research-heavy journey)
- Last-click for College-Age (shorter decision cycle)
- Account-level attribution for Corporate L&D (committee decisions)

This granular tracking enables real-time budget reallocation toward efficient channels and segments.

Now for Step 9 - Testing priorities. With $5M across three segments, what's your biggest uncertainty we should test first? Is it creative messaging, channel efficiency, or audience targeting within segments?

Turn 10:
Excellent testing roadmap - creative messaging is your highest-leverage variable given the tight CAC constraints, especially for College-Age.

**Priority Testing Framework:**

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): College-Age Creative**
- Test A: "Skip debt, gain skills" positioning
- Test B: Social proof from recent grad success stories  
- Test C: Specific job outcome stats ("92% employed within 6 months")
- Success metric: Which drives conversions under $27 CAC

**Phase 2 (Weeks 3-6): Career Changers Value Prop**
- Test A: Salary impact ("Add $15K to your salary")
- Test B: Skill advancement ("Master in-demand tech skills")
- Run across LinkedIn + podcasts for statistical significance

**Phase 3 (Weeks 5-8): Corporate L&D Business Impact**
- Test A: Efficiency messaging ("Upskill 3x faster")
- Test B: Competitive advantage ("Stay ahead of skill gaps")
- Test within ABM campaigns on target account list

This sequence tackles your tightest CAC constraint first while building learnings for higher-LTV segments.

Final step - Step 10: What's your biggest risk concern? Is it hitting volume targets, maintaining CAC discipline, or competitive response to your increased investment?

Turn 11:
You've identified the critical risk - volume interdependency with uneven optimization timelines. Corporate L&D's 90-180 day cycles mean early performance signals come entirely from Career Changers and College-Age.

**Risk Mitigation Strategy:**

**Weeks 1-8: Front-load Career Changers**
- Accelerate their budget pacing to 60% in Q1 vs. 25%
- Their 30-60 day cycles provide faster optimization signals
- Can compensate if College-Age messaging struggles initially

**College-Age Contingency Plan:**
- If creative tests show CACs above $27, immediately shift 50% of their budget to Career Changers
- Career Changers can absorb extra budget efficiently given $63 CAC tolerance
- Preserves total volume potential while respecting unit economics

**Corporate L&D Pipeline Acceleration:**
- Front-load ABM outreach to compress sales cycles where possible
- Consider higher-touch tactics (events, direct mail) for top-tier accounts
- Build pipeline early even if conversions lag

**Monthly Volume Checkpoints:**
- Week 4: College-Age creative performance assessment
- Week 8: Career Changers scaling capacity evaluation  
- Week 12: Corporate L&D pipeline velocity review

This creates multiple volume pathways while protecting your investor commitments. Does this risk framework address your primary concerns?

Turn 12:
Excellent - we've built a robust, segmented media plan that balances your enrollment targets with unit economics discipline.

**Plan Summary:**
- **Budget:** $5M allocated 35/35/30 across Corporate L&D/Career Changers/College-Age
- **Efficiency Targets:** $133/$63/$27 CAC respectively, supporting 50K total enrollments
- **Channel Strategy:** Segment-specific approaches matching media consumption patterns
- **Testing Priority:** College-Age creative messaging (highest risk/reward)
- **Risk Mitigation:** Front-loaded Career Changers with flexible budget reallocation

You now have a plan that leverages each segment's unique characteristics while maintaining volume flexibility. The measurement framework enables real-time optimization, and the contingency planning protects your investor commitments.

Your sophisticated understanding of segment differences - from Corporate L&D's ABM requirements to College-Age's creator-driven conversions - has created a plan that's both strategically sound and operationally executable.
