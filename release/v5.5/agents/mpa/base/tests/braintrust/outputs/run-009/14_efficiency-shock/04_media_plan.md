# Media Plan Output: Efficiency Shock

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect starting data - $750K budget for 15,000 applications gives us a clear efficiency target. Let me run the math: $750K ÷ 15,000 = $50 per application. With $2,800 LTV, that projects to a strong 56:1 LTV-to-acquisition ratio.

This is very achievable for insurance - industry benchmarks typically show $40-80 per application depending on product mix and targeting precision.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 15,000 applications? For example, are you focused on premium growth, market share expansion, or entering new customer segments?

Turn 3:
Perfect - 15,000 qualified applications converting at 65% to 9,750 policies gives us a solid foundation. Your $50 per qualified application target is realistic for insurance.

Now let's validate the economics. With $2,800 LTV per policyholder, your 9,750 issued policies project to roughly $27.3 million in lifetime value against your $750K investment. That's excellent unit economics.

One key question: Is that $2,800 LTV based on first-year premiums or true lifetime value over the full policy term? Insurance LTV calculations vary widely - some use 3-5 year value, others model full policy lifetime. 

Understanding this helps ensure our $50 acquisition cost aligns with your actual payback timeline and profitability requirements.

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Excellent - premium growth through new customer acquisition is clear. The 35-45 demographic focus makes strategic sense as that's prime life insurance consideration age.

Let me clarify one key measurement point: when you say 15,000 "policy applications," are these qualified applications that convert to policies at a predictable rate, or do you need 15,000 actual issued policies? 

This matters because if applications convert at, say, 60%, then 15,000 applications would yield about 9,000 policies. But if you need 15,000 actual policies, we'd need roughly 25,000 applications, changing our efficiency target significantly.

What's your typical application-to-policy conversion rate?

Turn 4:
Excellent - $2,800 over 5 years with 55% margins gives you strong unit economics. At $50 per qualified application, you'll achieve positive ROI well within 18 months, which is healthy for insurance acquisition.

Your efficiency target is realistic and your economics are sound. We have a solid foundation for Steps 1-2.

Moving to Step 3 - Audience. You mentioned wanting to expand into the 35-45 demographic for families starting to think about protection. 

What does your current customer base look like demographically? Understanding who converts best today will help us balance proven segments with your expansion goals into younger demographics.

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Great context - your proven 45-60 segment with established financial responsibilities gives us a strong foundation, while the 35-45 expansion represents clear growth opportunity.

For the 35-45 segment specifically, what life events or circumstances typically trigger their interest in life insurance? You mentioned having kids and first home purchases - are there other key moments when this demographic becomes most receptive to life insurance messaging?

Understanding these trigger events helps us identify the right behavioral signals for targeting beyond just age demographics.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Perfect - those are strong behavioral triggers: new babies, first mortgages, job promotions, and age milestones. These life events create natural urgency and receptivity that we can target effectively.

Let me get a sense of audience scale. In your target markets, roughly how many households fit your ideal profile? For example, if we're targeting 35-45 year-olds with new babies or recent home purchases in middle-to-upper income brackets, are we looking at hundreds of thousands or millions of potential households?

This helps determine if we have sufficient audience scale to support your 15,000 application goal, or if we need to broaden the targeting approach.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Excellent - several million households with hundreds of thousands experiencing key life events annually gives us massive scale. You're right that timing is everything - reaching them when they're actively considering, not just eligible.

Moving to Step 4 - Geography. Are you targeting nationwide, or do you have specific states or regions where you're licensed to sell? Insurance regulations vary significantly by state, so understanding your geographic scope will shape our targeting approach.

Also, do you see better performance in certain regions currently, or any areas you specifically want to prioritize for growth?
