# Media Plan Output: Channel Mix Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with this launch? For example, are you focused on brand awareness, trial generation, or driving immediate sales?

Turn 2:
Perfect, brand awareness as the primary objective with trial as a secondary benefit. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success as a number.

For brand awareness campaigns, what specific metric will you use to define success? For example, aided brand awareness percentage, unaided awareness, or reach against your target audience?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - 15-20% aided awareness and 70% reach of 2 million households gives us clear targets. That means reaching 1.4 million households effectively.

$3M / 1.4M households = approximately $2.14 per household reached. For national brand awareness campaigns targeting health-conscious families, this efficiency is realistic and should allow for quality frequency delivery.

Now let's define your target audience more precisely. You mentioned health-conscious families - can you describe the primary decision maker you're trying to reach? For example, are you targeting the primary grocery shopper, and what other characteristics define your ideal customer?

Turn 4:
Great targeting - women 25-54, $75K+ HHI, organic shoppers at premium retailers. That's a well-defined audience with clear shopping behaviors.

For geography, you mentioned targeting nationally. Are there specific regions or markets where you want to focus first, or do you want even distribution across all markets? Sometimes organic adoption varies significantly by region - coastal markets versus heartland, urban versus suburban areas.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Perfect - 60/40 allocation toward high-adoption coastal and urban markets makes strategic sense for organic snack launch. That geographic weighting should improve efficiency.

Now let's validate your budget allocation. With $3M total budget:
- 60% to high-adoption markets = $1.8M 
- 40% to broader national markets = $1.2M

At your target of reaching 1.4M households, this projects to solid frequency delivery in priority markets while maintaining national presence.

Is this $3M your total media budget, or does it include production, creative development, and other campaign costs?

Turn 6:
Excellent - $3M in pure working media gives us strong buying power. 

Now let's develop your value proposition. You mentioned organic snacks for health-conscious families, but what specifically makes PureLife Organics snacks different from other organic options already on shelf? What's your key differentiator that will break through in a crowded organic snack market?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Perfect - "pure ingredients, pure nutrition" with single-ingredient positioning is compelling differentiation. That builds naturally on your produce reputation and addresses a real parent concern about ingredient complexity.

Now we're ready for channel strategy. Based on your brand awareness objective, health-conscious family targeting, and premium organic positioning, I'd recommend a mix that combines broad reach with precise targeting:

**Primary channels (70% of budget):**
- Connected TV/Streaming: Premium brand-safe environment, reaches cord-cutting families
- Social Video (Meta/Instagram): Strong targeting for health-conscious moms, recipe integration potential
- YouTube: Educational content opportunity, high engagement with parent audience

**Supporting channels (30% of budget):**
- Programmatic Display: Retargeting and awareness support
- Paid Search: Capture organic snack intent
- Influencer partnerships: Mom/family lifestyle credibility

Does this channel approach align with how you envision building awareness, or do you have specific channel preferences based on past PureLife campaigns?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
Great questions! For Connected TV, I'd recommend a mix:

**Premium streaming (60% of CTV budget):** Hulu, Paramount+, Peacock - these have strong family content and allow better targeting of your health-conscious demo.

**Network CTV (40% of CTV budget):** NBC, ABC streaming apps - broader reach but still brand-safe, good for awareness building.

For social video, stick with Meta platforms (Instagram/Facebook) for now. Here's why: Your target moms 25-54 are heavily concentrated there, especially for parenting and food content. TikTok skews younger and while it's growing with millennial moms, your budget is better concentrated where your core audience already engages with food brands.

However, if you have strong creative assets that translate well to TikTok, we could test it in month 2-3 with 5-10% of social budget.

Now let's discuss measurement. Beyond your aided awareness tracking, what attribution and performance measurement capabilities do you currently have? Do you have ways to track website visits, store locators, or other engagement metrics that connect to media exposure?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 9:
That's a realistic measurement setup for retail CPG. Website traffic and store locator usage are solid leading indicators, especially for awareness campaigns.

For your aided awareness measurement, I'd recommend:
- **Pre/post brand studies** at 3 and 6 months to track your 15-20% awareness goal
- **Geo-holdout testing** in 10-15% of markets to measure true incremental lift
- **Brand search volume** as a real-time awareness proxy

Given your in-store sales challenge, focus on leading indicators that correlate with purchase intent: branded search increases, store locator usage spikes, and time spent on product pages.

One key consideration: Connected TV and social video will be easier to measure than traditional channels, but brand awareness often has delayed effects. Your 6-month measurement window is appropriate.

Now let's discuss testing approach. What aspects of the campaign do you most want to test and learn from - creative messaging, channel mix, or audience targeting?
