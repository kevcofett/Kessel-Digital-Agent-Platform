# Media Plan Output: Geography Expansion Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've shared great foundational information. Let me clarify one key point: when you say "drive 500,000 store visits and online conversions combined" - what's the primary business outcome you're measuring success against? Are you focused on total transactions, new customer acquisition, or overall revenue growth?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect! So 500,000 total transactions is your volume target to increase market share. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success as a number.

$2.5M ÷ 500,000 = $5 per transaction for acquisition. That's an extremely efficient target that suggests either very high transaction values or strong organic/retention components.

What's your average transaction value across online and in-store combined? This will help me assess if that $5 efficiency is realistic for new customer acquisition.

Turn 4:
Great insight! Let me model this with your 60/40 split:

300,000 new customers (60%) at $2.5M budget = $8.33 per new customer acquisition
200,000 repeat customers (40%) driven by media

$8.33 CAC is extremely efficient - well below the $15-45 industry range. This suggests strong organic amplification or very efficient targeting, which is possible with your existing brand recognition.

However, driving 200,000 repeat purchases through media is substantial. Typically, retention-focused spend is much more efficient than acquisition.

Given this analysis, your target could work if you have strong brand awareness driving organic lift. But if performance doesn't match these projections, would you prefer to adjust volume expectations down or increase budget to hit 500K transactions at more typical efficiency rates?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Exactly right to reassess! At $180 average transaction value, your implied efficiency is actually quite strong but needs context.

$2.5M ÷ 500,000 = $5 per transaction
500,000 × $180 = $90M total revenue
That's a 36:1 revenue-to-ad-spend ratio

For athletic apparel, typical customer acquisition costs range from $15-45 depending on channel mix and competition. Your $5 target assumes either:
- Significant brand awareness driving organic lift
- High percentage of existing customers in that 500K
- Or very efficient channel execution

Before we adjust targets, what percentage of those 500,000 transactions do you expect to be new customers versus repeat customers?

Turn 6:
Perfect! 350,000 transactions at $11.90 CAC is locked in. Now let's define your audience precisely.

You mentioned active adults 25-45, but successful campaigns typically layer 15-25 targeting signals for performance work. Let's start building your audience profile.

Beyond age 25-45, what are the most important behavioral signals that identify your best customers? For example, do they shop specific athletic categories, follow fitness influencers, use particular apps, or have certain purchase patterns that distinguish them from casual activewear buyers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Smart strategic thinking! Let's model the revised target:

$2.5M ÷ 350,000 = $7.14 per transaction

With your 60/40 split:
- 210,000 new customers = $11.90 CAC
- 140,000 repeat customers driven by media

$11.90 CAC is much more realistic - still efficient but achievable with good execution. This positions you well within industry benchmarks while maintaining aggressive growth targets.

At $180 AOV, this projects to $63M revenue with a 25:1 return ratio, which is strong and defensible.

Does this 350,000 transaction target feel realistic given your current market position and growth objectives? If so, we can lock this in and move to defining your audience more precisely.

Turn 7:
Excellent! You're identifying high-value behavioral signals. Let me capture what you've shared:

**Behavioral:** Performance gear buyers (not just athleisure), seasonal purchase patterns, fitness app users (Strava, MyFitnessPal), follow fitness influencers
**Psychographic:** Serious about fitness routines, invest in quality gear, wellness-focused
**Economic:** Higher household income, premium price tolerance

Now for geographic precision - you mentioned US market. Within the US, are there specific regions, metro areas, or market types where your brand performs strongest? For example, do you see better performance in urban vs suburban areas, or particular regions like West Coast, Northeast, etc.?

Turn 8:
Perfect geographic insights! You're targeting high-opportunity markets:

**Geographic Profile:**
- Urban/suburban focus (avoid rural)
- West Coast strength: California, Pacific Northwest
- Major metros: NYC, Chicago, Atlanta
- Educated, affluent communities with fitness culture

**Complete Audience:**
- Ages 25-45 in urban/suburban markets
- Performance gear buyers using fitness apps
- Follow fitness influencers, seasonal purchasers
- Higher HHI, premium price tolerance
- Serious fitness enthusiasts in wellness-focused areas

This audience definition gives us strong targeting precision for efficient media execution.

Now let's validate your $2.5M budget allocation. Should this be split proportionally across your geographic markets based on population, or do you want to weight it toward your strongest-performing regions like the West Coast and major metros?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Excellent strategic allocation! Your geographic weighting makes perfect sense:

**Budget Allocation by Geography:**
- 40% West Coast (CA + Pacific NW): $1M
- 35% Major metros (NYC, Chicago, Atlanta): $875K  
- 25% Test/expansion markets: $625K

This concentrates 75% of spend in proven markets while maintaining 25% for growth - a smart balance of performance and expansion.

At your $11.90 target CAC, this projects to:
- 84K transactions from West Coast
- 74K transactions from major metros  
- 53K transactions from test markets
- Total: 211K new customers (plus 139K repeat customers = 350K total)

Now let's define what will make customers choose ActiveWear Pro over competitors. What's your core value proposition - the main reason someone should buy from you instead of other athletic apparel brands?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Perfect positioning! Your value proposition is clear and differentiated:

**ActiveWear Pro Value Proposition:**
- Performance-driven innovation with technical features
- Accessible premium pricing (quality without Nike/Lululemon premiums)
- Moisture-wicking, compression tech, high-intensity durability
- Strong sustainability practices
- For serious fitness enthusiasts who want quality + value

This gives us strong messaging angles: technical performance benefits, smart value positioning, and sustainability credentials that resonate with your wellness-focused audience.

Now let's build your channel strategy. Given your $2.5M budget, audience profile, and geographic focus, what channels are you currently considering or already using? Are you thinking digital-first, or do you want to include traditional channels like TV or out-of-home?
