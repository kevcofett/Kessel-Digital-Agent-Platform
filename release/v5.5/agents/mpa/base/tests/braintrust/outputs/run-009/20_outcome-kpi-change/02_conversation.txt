TURN 1 (Step 1)

USER:
Hi, I'm Head of Marketing at TrustGuard Insurance. We need to build a media plan to drive 25,000 new policy acquisitions with a $5M budget. Our target is homeowners 35-65 with $100K+ household income, particularly those going through life events like buying a home, having a baby, or approaching retirement. LTV is around $2,800.

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business outcome clearly. You mentioned 25,000 new policy acquisitions - is this your primary success metric, or are there other business outcomes like revenue targets or market share goals that matter equally?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 2 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Yes, 25,000 new policy acquisitions is our primary metric. With an average LTV of $2,800, that translates to about $70M in lifetime value. We're also looking to increase our SOV in key markets where we compete with the major national carriers, but the policy count is definitely the main KPI we're optimizing for.

AGENT:
Perfect! So your primary objective is 25,000 new policy acquisitions, measured as your main KPI. That $70M lifetime value projection shows strong business impact.

Let me check your efficiency target: $5M budget ÷ 25,000 policies = $200 per acquisition. 

With your $2,800 LTV, that creates a 14x LTV/CAC ratio, which is exceptionally strong for insurance. Industry benchmarks typically show 3-5x ratios, so your target suggests either very efficient acquisition or conservative LTV estimates.

Is this $200 acquisition cost realistic based on your historical performance, or should we model different scenarios?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 3 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Honestly, I'm not entirely sure if $200 per acquisition is realistic - we haven't had the most sophisticated tracking in place historically. Our current CAC varies quite a bit depending on the channel, but I think we've been closer to $300-400 in some of our digital efforts. The $2,800 LTV might be conservative since it doesn't fully account for cross-sell opportunities and policy renewals beyond the initial term. Should we maybe plan for a higher CAC target to be safe?

AGENT:
Great insight - that honesty helps us build a realistic plan. Your $300-400 historical CAC is actually more typical for insurance.

Let me model a few scenarios:

**Conservative (your target):** $200 CAC = 25,000 policies within $5M budget
**Realistic (based on your experience):** $300 CAC = 16,667 policies with $5M budget  
**Market rate:** $400 CAC = 12,500 policies with $5M budget

Given your cross-sell potential isn't fully captured in that $2,800 LTV, even $400 CAC could work well long-term.

Which feels more achievable for planning purposes - the aggressive $200 target, or should we model around $300-350 CAC and potentially exceed 25,000 policies if we hit efficiency gains?

Events: calculation_performed, benchmark_cited, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 4 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I think we should plan around the $300-350 CAC range - that feels much more realistic given our historical performance. If we model at $300 CAC, that gets us to about 16,667 policies, which is still a significant volume increase for us. And you're right about the upside - if we can optimize and hit some efficiency gains through better targeting or channel mix, we could potentially get closer to that 25,000 target. I'd rather set realistic expectations and potentially overdeliver than promise 25,000 and fall short.

AGENT:
Smart approach - realistic planning with upside potential. Let me model at $300 CAC:

$5M budget ÷ $300 CAC = 16,667 new policies
At $2,800 LTV = $46.7M lifetime value
LTV/CAC ratio = 9.3x (still very healthy for insurance)

This gives you a solid foundation with clear upside if we achieve efficiency gains through tight audience targeting or optimal channel mix.

Now let's move to Step 2 economics validation. Based on industry benchmarks for homeowners insurance, $300 CAC is achievable but will require disciplined targeting and channel selection. Your life event triggers (home purchase, new baby, retirement planning) are smart - these moments create genuine insurance shopping behavior.

Is there a specific profit margin or payback period requirement we should factor into this efficiency target?

Events: calculation_performed, benchmark_cited, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 5 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We typically aim for a 12-18 month payback period on our acquisition spend, though I'd need to check with our CFO on the exact margin requirements. The life event targeting has worked well for us in the past - people are much more receptive to insurance conversations when they're already thinking about protecting their new assets or life changes. I think the $300 CAC with that 9.3x ratio should work within our financial parameters, but let me know if you need more specific margin data as we build this out.

AGENT:
Excellent - 12-18 month payback is very reasonable for insurance, and that 9.3x LTV/CAC ratio should easily meet those requirements. I'll model based on this framework and you can refine with CFO input anytime.

Perfect, we've established solid economics: 16,667 policies at $300 CAC within your $5M budget. Now let's move to Step 3 - Audience.

You mentioned homeowners 35-65 with $100K+ household income, focusing on life events like home purchase, new baby, and retirement planning. To build precise targeting, I need to understand your audience priorities.

Which of these three life event segments typically converts best for you, or should we weight them equally in our targeting strategy?

Events: benchmark_cited, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 6 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
From our experience, the home purchase segment has been our strongest converter - those folks are actively shopping for homeowners insurance anyway, so the timing is perfect. New parents are good too, especially first-time parents who are suddenly thinking about protecting their family's future. The retirement planning segment is a bit trickier - they convert well when we reach them, but they're harder to identify and target precisely. I'd say we should probably weight it 50% home purchase, 30% new parents, and 20% retirement planning to start.

AGENT:
Perfect segmentation strategy. That weighting makes sense - home purchase captures in-market demand, new parents have urgency, and retirement planning offers quality but requires more precision.

Let me map your audience priorities:
- **Home Purchase (50%):** Active insurance shoppers, highest intent
- **New Parents (30%):** Life change triggers, strong urgency  
- **Retirement Planning (20%):** Quality prospects, harder to identify

For the home purchase segment specifically, are you looking to target people who just closed on a home, or should we also include those actively house hunting? The timing window affects our targeting signals and channel strategy.

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 7 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I think we should focus primarily on people who just closed - that's when they're actively required to get homeowners insurance, usually within 30-60 days. We've found that window right after closing is golden because they have to act quickly. House hunters can be valuable too, but they're not as urgent and might still be months away from needing coverage. Maybe we do 80% recent closings and 20% active house hunters to capture some of that earlier funnel activity?

AGENT:
Excellent timing insight! That 30-60 day post-closing window is indeed golden - mandatory purchase with deadline urgency.

So within your 50% home purchase allocation:
- **Recent closings (40% of total):** High-intent, time-sensitive, mandatory purchase
- **Active house hunters (10% of total):** Earlier funnel, longer consideration

This targeting precision will significantly improve your $300 CAC efficiency. Recent closings should perform well below that target.

One more audience question: Within your 35-65 age range and $100K+ income, are there any geographic concentrations where you perform particularly well, or should we plan for broad national targeting across all markets where you're licensed?

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 8 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're licensed nationally, but we definitely have some markets where we perform better than others. Our strongest regions tend to be the Southeast and parts of the Midwest - places like Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, and Texas have been really solid for us. We struggle a bit more in the high-cost coastal markets like California and the Northeast where we're competing against some deeply entrenched local players. I think we should probably focus about 60% of our budget on those stronger markets where our conversion rates are higher, and use the remaining 40% to test expansion in some of the tougher but high-value markets.

AGENT:
Smart geographic strategy! Focusing on your proven markets while testing expansion makes excellent sense for budget efficiency.

**Primary Markets (60% of budget):** Southeast & Midwest - Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas
**Test Markets (40% of budget):** Coastal markets with higher competition but strong lifetime value potential

This geographic focus should help you achieve that $300 CAC target more easily in your strong markets, while the test allocation lets you build presence in valuable but challenging territories.

We've now defined your audience with strong precision: homeowners 35-65, $100K+ income, weighted toward recent home closings and new parents, concentrated in your high-performing regions. 

Ready to move to Step 4 - Geography refinement, or do you want to add any other audience characteristics that drive strong performance for TrustGuard?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 9 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
That audience definition looks solid - I think we've captured the key characteristics that drive performance for us. The geographic split makes sense too, especially since we can be more aggressive with our messaging and spend in those proven markets where we know the competitive landscape better.

One thing I'd add is that we've noticed homeowners with higher home values - say $300K+ - tend to be better long-term customers, probably because they have more to protect and are less price-sensitive. Should we factor that into our targeting, or would that limit our reach too much in some of those primary markets?

AGENT:
Great insight on home values - that's a strong quality signal. Higher-value homeowners typically have better retention and cross-sell potential, which would boost that $2,800 LTV assumption.

Let me think about reach impact: $300K+ homes would be very accessible in your test markets (coastal areas), solid in Texas and parts of Georgia/North Carolina, but might limit reach in some Midwest markets where $300K represents a higher percentile.

Given your 60/40 geographic split, we could tier this:
- **Test markets (40%):** Target $300K+ homes (abundant supply)
- **Primary markets (60%):** Mix of $300K+ and $200K+ to maintain volume

This balances quality with reach. Would this approach work, or do you prefer consistent $300K+ targeting across all markets?

Events: benchmark_cited, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 10 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
That tiered approach makes a lot of sense. You're absolutely right that $300K means different things in different markets - what gets you a decent home in Ohio might barely cover a starter home in California. The mix strategy for our primary markets should help us maintain volume while still skewing toward higher-quality prospects.

I think we should go with that approach - $300K+ in the test markets where that's more accessible, and then maybe a 70/30 split between $300K+ and $200K+ homes in our primary markets. That way we're still prioritizing the higher-value prospects but not artificially constraining our reach in markets where we know we can perform well.

AGENT:
Perfect! That tiered home value strategy optimizes for both quality and volume:

**Test Markets (40% budget):** $300K+ homes - premium prospects in high-value markets
**Primary Markets (60% budget):** 70% at $300K+, 30% at $200K+ - quality focus with volume flexibility

This approach should actually improve your effective CAC since higher-value homeowners typically convert better and have stronger LTV.

We've completed solid audience and geography definition. Now let's move to Step 5 - Budget allocation.

With your $5M budget, how would you prefer to think about allocation - by geography first, then audience segments? Or would you rather start with audience segments across all markets? This affects how we optimize spend efficiency across your different target groups.
