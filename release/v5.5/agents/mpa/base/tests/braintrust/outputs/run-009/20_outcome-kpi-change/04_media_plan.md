# Media Plan Output: Outcome KPI Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business outcome clearly. You mentioned 25,000 new policy acquisitions - is this your primary success metric, or are there other business outcomes like revenue targets or market share goals that matter equally?

Turn 2:
Perfect! So your primary objective is 25,000 new policy acquisitions, measured as your main KPI. That $70M lifetime value projection shows strong business impact.

Let me check your efficiency target: $5M budget ÷ 25,000 policies = $200 per acquisition. 

With your $2,800 LTV, that creates a 14x LTV/CAC ratio, which is exceptionally strong for insurance. Industry benchmarks typically show 3-5x ratios, so your target suggests either very efficient acquisition or conservative LTV estimates.

Is this $200 acquisition cost realistic based on your historical performance, or should we model different scenarios?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Great insight - that honesty helps us build a realistic plan. Your $300-400 historical CAC is actually more typical for insurance.

Let me model a few scenarios:

**Conservative (your target):** $200 CAC = 25,000 policies within $5M budget
**Realistic (based on your experience):** $300 CAC = 16,667 policies with $5M budget  
**Market rate:** $400 CAC = 12,500 policies with $5M budget

Given your cross-sell potential isn't fully captured in that $2,800 LTV, even $400 CAC could work well long-term.

Which feels more achievable for planning purposes - the aggressive $200 target, or should we model around $300-350 CAC and potentially exceed 25,000 policies if we hit efficiency gains?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Smart approach - realistic planning with upside potential. Let me model at $300 CAC:

$5M budget ÷ $300 CAC = 16,667 new policies
At $2,800 LTV = $46.7M lifetime value
LTV/CAC ratio = 9.3x (still very healthy for insurance)

This gives you a solid foundation with clear upside if we achieve efficiency gains through tight audience targeting or optimal channel mix.

Now let's move to Step 2 economics validation. Based on industry benchmarks for homeowners insurance, $300 CAC is achievable but will require disciplined targeting and channel selection. Your life event triggers (home purchase, new baby, retirement planning) are smart - these moments create genuine insurance shopping behavior.

Is there a specific profit margin or payback period requirement we should factor into this efficiency target?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Excellent - 12-18 month payback is very reasonable for insurance, and that 9.3x LTV/CAC ratio should easily meet those requirements. I'll model based on this framework and you can refine with CFO input anytime.

Perfect, we've established solid economics: 16,667 policies at $300 CAC within your $5M budget. Now let's move to Step 3 - Audience.

You mentioned homeowners 35-65 with $100K+ household income, focusing on life events like home purchase, new baby, and retirement planning. To build precise targeting, I need to understand your audience priorities.

Which of these three life event segments typically converts best for you, or should we weight them equally in our targeting strategy?

Turn 6:
Perfect segmentation strategy. That weighting makes sense - home purchase captures in-market demand, new parents have urgency, and retirement planning offers quality but requires more precision.

Let me map your audience priorities:
- **Home Purchase (50%):** Active insurance shoppers, highest intent
- **New Parents (30%):** Life change triggers, strong urgency  
- **Retirement Planning (20%):** Quality prospects, harder to identify

For the home purchase segment specifically, are you looking to target people who just closed on a home, or should we also include those actively house hunting? The timing window affects our targeting signals and channel strategy.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Smart geographic strategy! Focusing on your proven markets while testing expansion makes excellent sense for budget efficiency.

**Primary Markets (60% of budget):** Southeast & Midwest - Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas
**Test Markets (40% of budget):** Coastal markets with higher competition but strong lifetime value potential

This geographic focus should help you achieve that $300 CAC target more easily in your strong markets, while the test allocation lets you build presence in valuable but challenging territories.

We've now defined your audience with strong precision: homeowners 35-65, $100K+ income, weighted toward recent home closings and new parents, concentrated in your high-performing regions. 

Ready to move to Step 4 - Geography refinement, or do you want to add any other audience characteristics that drive strong performance for TrustGuard?

Turn 9:
Great insight on home values - that's a strong quality signal. Higher-value homeowners typically have better retention and cross-sell potential, which would boost that $2,800 LTV assumption.

Let me think about reach impact: $300K+ homes would be very accessible in your test markets (coastal areas), solid in Texas and parts of Georgia/North Carolina, but might limit reach in some Midwest markets where $300K represents a higher percentile.

Given your 60/40 geographic split, we could tier this:
- **Test markets (40%):** Target $300K+ homes (abundant supply)
- **Primary markets (60%):** Mix of $300K+ and $200K+ to maintain volume

This balances quality with reach. Would this approach work, or do you prefer consistent $300K+ targeting across all markets?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 7:
Excellent timing insight! That 30-60 day post-closing window is indeed golden - mandatory purchase with deadline urgency.

So within your 50% home purchase allocation:
- **Recent closings (40% of total):** High-intent, time-sensitive, mandatory purchase
- **Active house hunters (10% of total):** Earlier funnel, longer consideration

This targeting precision will significantly improve your $300 CAC efficiency. Recent closings should perform well below that target.

One more audience question: Within your 35-65 age range and $100K+ income, are there any geographic concentrations where you perform particularly well, or should we plan for broad national targeting across all markets where you're licensed?

Turn 10:
Perfect! That tiered home value strategy optimizes for both quality and volume:

**Test Markets (40% budget):** $300K+ homes - premium prospects in high-value markets
**Primary Markets (60% budget):** 70% at $300K+, 30% at $200K+ - quality focus with volume flexibility

This approach should actually improve your effective CAC since higher-value homeowners typically convert better and have stronger LTV.

We've completed solid audience and geography definition. Now let's move to Step 5 - Budget allocation.

With your $5M budget, how would you prefer to think about allocation - by geography first, then audience segments? Or would you rather start with audience segments across all markets? This affects how we optimize spend efficiency across your different target groups.
