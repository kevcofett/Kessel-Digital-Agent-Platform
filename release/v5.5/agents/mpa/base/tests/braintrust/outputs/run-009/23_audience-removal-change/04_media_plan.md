# Media Plan Output: Audience Removal Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start - you've given me rich context. Let me calculate your implied efficiency: $4M ÷ 15,000 = $267 per test drive. That's aggressive but achievable for premium EV launches.

Before we dive deeper into economics, I need to understand your primary business outcome. Test drives are a great engagement metric, but what's the ultimate business goal - vehicle sales, brand awareness, or something else?

Turn 3:
Perfect! Let me run those numbers: $267 × 3.33 = $890 per customer acquisition, which gives you a healthy 6.2x margin-to-CAC ratio ($5,500 ÷ $890). That's excellent for automotive - most successful premium launches target 4-6x.

Your economics are solid. At 30% conversion, your 15,000 test drives project to approximately 4,500 vehicle sales, generating about $247M in revenue with $24.75M in margin. Your $4M media investment represents just 16% of projected margin - very sustainable.

This efficiency target is ambitious but achievable for premium EV with your strong conversion rate. The key will be precise audience targeting across your three segments.

Ready to move to Step 3 and define those audience segments more precisely?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Excellent - sales volume with brand awareness as a supporting objective. Your strong test drive conversion rate is a key advantage.

To assess if your $267 per test drive target is realistic, I need to understand your sales funnel. What's your conversion rate from test drive to purchase? For example, if 1 in 4 test drives becomes a sale, that would mean you're effectively paying about $1,068 to acquire each customer ($267 × 4).

This helps me determine if your efficiency target aligns with typical premium automotive economics.

Turn 4:
Excellent! Let's build precise targeting for each segment to hit your efficiency targets.

Starting with your eco-conscious early adopters (25-45): Beyond age and environmental interest, what specific behaviors or characteristics define this group? For example, do they shop at Whole Foods, drive current hybrids, follow sustainability influencers, or have specific income thresholds?

The more behavioral signals we identify, the better we can target this segment efficiently across your five states.

Turn 5:
Perfect profile - that gives us 8-10 strong targeting signals. This segment should be highly targetable across digital channels.

Now for your luxury buyers (45-65) switching from German sedans: What specific luxury behaviors and preferences define this group beyond the age range? Are we talking current BMW/Mercedes/Audi owners with certain income levels, specific lifestyle interests, or particular media consumption habits?

This segment likely has different digital behaviors than your eco-conscious group, so precision here is crucial for efficiency.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Excellent - that's a very different targeting and media consumption profile. Higher income threshold, traditional media preferences, and peer influence versus online research. This segment will likely require different channels than your eco-conscious adopters.

Finally, your tech enthusiasts who care about features: What defines this group beyond their interest in technology? Are we talking specific age ranges, income levels, current vehicle types, or particular tech behaviors like early gadget adoption or following tech influencers?

Understanding their profile completes our targeting foundation across all three segments.

Turn 7:
Perfect! Now I have clear profiles for all three segments with distinct targeting signals and media behaviors.

Let me summarize your audience framework:
- **Eco-conscious early adopters**: $75K-$150K income, hybrid owners, sustainability-focused, heavy online researchers
- **Luxury switchers**: $150K-$400K income, German luxury owners, traditional media consumers, peer-influenced  
- **Tech enthusiasts**: $100K-$250K income, early adopters, spec-focused, heavy digital researchers

Now for Step 4 - Geography. You mentioned California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Washington. Do you want to weight these states equally, or should we prioritize certain markets based on EV adoption rates, your dealer network, or other factors?

This will help determine budget allocation and projected outcomes by market.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Great geographic prioritization! Let me adjust those percentages - you mentioned 35-40% for California initially, but your breakdown totals 25%. Let me clarify:

**Option A (Conservative California):** CA 25%, NY 20%, WA 20%, TX 15%, FL 15% = 95% (5% flexibility reserve)

**Option B (Aggressive California):** CA 35%, NY 18%, WA 18%, TX 14%, FL 15% = 100%

Your reasoning is sound - California's EV infrastructure and segment representation justify higher allocation, while Texas/Florida offer scale opportunities despite slower adoption.

Which allocation feels right, or would you prefer a different split? This determines roughly $1M vs $1.4M for California, which significantly impacts your projected test drive volume there.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Perfect! Your geographic allocation is locked:
- **California: 35% ($1.4M)** - Premium investment in your strongest market
- **New York: 18% ($720K)** - Strong eco-conscious and tech segments  
- **Washington: 18% ($720K)** - High EV adoption, good incentives
- **Texas: 14% ($560K)** - Scale opportunity, luxury segment traction
- **Florida: 15% ($600K)** - Miami luxury market, emerging opportunity

This projects roughly 5,250 test drives from California alone at your target efficiency.

Now for Step 5 - Budget allocation by segment. Should we weight your three audience segments equally across markets, or do certain segments deserve more investment? For example, does the luxury segment warrant higher spend given their $55K purchase value, or should eco-conscious get priority for market share building?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Smart allocation strategy! Your segment weighting makes excellent sense:
- **Luxury segment: 40% ($1.6M)** - Highest conversion likelihood, premium margin
- **Eco-conscious: 35% ($1.4M)** - Brand building and market share foundation  
- **Tech enthusiasts: 25% ($1M)** - Word-of-mouth and review generation

This projects roughly:
- 6,000 luxury test drives → ~1,800 sales
- 5,250 eco-conscious test drives → ~1,575 sales  
- 3,750 tech enthusiast test drives → ~1,125 sales

Total: 4,500 projected sales, exactly hitting your economics model.

Now for Step 6 - Value Proposition. Each segment needs different messaging. What's your core value proposition for the luxury switchers? Is it performance that rivals German engineering, sustainability without sacrifice, or something else that speaks to their switch motivation?

Turn 11:
Excellent positioning - "Performance without compromise" directly addresses their switch hesitation. Smart to frame sustainability as progressive thinking rather than sacrifice.

What about your eco-conscious early adopters? Their value proposition likely emphasizes different benefits - is it about environmental impact, being part of the solution, or something else that resonates with their sustainability-first mindset?

Turn 12:
Perfect - "Drive the change you want to see" connects their values to action. The financial and energy independence angles add practical reinforcement to the emotional appeal.

Finally, for your tech enthusiasts focused on features - what's their core value proposition? Given their spec-driven research behavior and interest in technical capabilities, I imagine it's quite different from the other two segments.
