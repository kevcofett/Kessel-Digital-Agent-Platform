USER:
Hi! I'm looking to get more people to buy shoes from our online store. Can you help me figure out the best way to do that?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve? For example, are you looking to get a certain number of new customers, hit a revenue target, or grow your customer base by a specific amount?

TURN 2 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I want to get more people buying our shoes, but I haven't really set a specific number yet. We're a smaller company and just want to grow our customer base as much as we can with the budget we have. Maybe we could aim for a certain revenue number? I'm not sure what's realistic though.

AGENT:
Got it! Let's figure out what's realistic for your business. To help set a good target, I need to understand your shoe business better.

What does a typical customer spend when they buy from you? For example, is your average order around $50, $100, $200, or something else?

USER:
I'd say most people spend around $80-120 when they buy from us. We sell different types of shoes - some casual ones that are cheaper and some nicer dress shoes that cost more. I think the average is probably somewhere around $100, but I'd have to check our numbers to be sure.

AGENT:
Perfect, $100 average order is a great starting point. Now, do your customers typically buy just once, or do they come back and buy again over time? 

For example, does the average customer buy once for $100 and that's it, or do they return and maybe spend $200-300 total over a year or two?

TURN 4 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We do have some customers who come back, but I'm not totally sure about the exact numbers. I'd say maybe half of our customers buy again within a year? The ones who do come back usually buy another pair or two. So I guess they might spend around $200-250 total over time, but that's just my rough guess from what I've seen.

AGENT:
That helps! I'll model using $200 customer value (meaning what each customer is worth over time) based on your estimate. You can refine this anytime as we go.

Now, what budget are you working with for bringing in new customers? This could be monthly, quarterly, or whatever timeframe makes sense for your business.

TURN 5 (Step 2)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We have about $250,000 to spend on marketing this year. I'm not sure if we should spread that out evenly each month or if there are better times to spend more, like during certain seasons when people buy more shoes.

AGENT:
Great! $250,000 gives us solid capacity to grow your customer base. Let me show you what this means for your business:

$250,000 ÷ $200 customer value = approximately 1,250 new customers if we spend $200 to get each one.

But we need to spend less than $200 per customer to make money. How much profit do you typically make on that $100 average order? For example, after paying for the shoes, shipping, and other costs, do you keep around $20, $40, $60, or something else?
