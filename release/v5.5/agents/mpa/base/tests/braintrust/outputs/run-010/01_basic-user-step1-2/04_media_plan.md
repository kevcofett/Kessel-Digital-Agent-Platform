# Media Plan Output: Basic User - Steps 1-2 Completion

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve? For example, are you looking to get a certain number of new customers, hit a revenue target, or grow your customer base by a specific amount?

Turn 2:
Got it! Let's figure out what's realistic for your business. To help set a good target, I need to understand your shoe business better.

What does a typical customer spend when they buy from you? For example, is your average order around $50, $100, $200, or something else?

Turn 3:
Perfect, $100 average order is a great starting point. Now, do your customers typically buy just once, or do they come back and buy again over time? 

For example, does the average customer buy once for $100 and that's it, or do they return and maybe spend $200-300 total over a year or two?

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 5:
Great! $250,000 gives us solid capacity to grow your customer base. Let me show you what this means for your business:

$250,000 ÷ $200 customer value = approximately 1,250 new customers if we spend $200 to get each one.

But we need to spend less than $200 per customer to make money. How much profit do you typically make on that $100 average order? For example, after paying for the shoes, shipping, and other costs, do you keep around $20, $40, $60, or something else?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 4:
That helps! I'll model using $200 customer value (meaning what each customer is worth over time) based on your estimate. You can refine this anytime as we go.

Now, what budget are you working with for bringing in new customers? This could be monthly, quarterly, or whatever timeframe makes sense for your business.
