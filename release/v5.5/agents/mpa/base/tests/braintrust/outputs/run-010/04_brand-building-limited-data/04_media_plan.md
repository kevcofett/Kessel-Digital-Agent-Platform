# Media Plan Output: Brand Building with Limited Data

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start - launching GreenLeaf Wellness on the West Coast with $500K for brand awareness. Since you're entering a new market, we'll model using industry benchmarks where needed.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with this brand awareness campaign? For example, are you looking to drive a certain number of new customers, generate leads, or reach a specific revenue target in these three states?

Turn 3:
Perfect - new customers as your primary metric makes sense for market entry.

For wellness/supplements, $500K typically acquires 2,500 to 10,000 new customers depending on your price points and targeting precision. Here's the math:

**$500K budget breakdown:**
- If we achieve $50 per customer: $500K ÷ $50 = 10,000 customers  
- If we achieve $100 per customer: $500K ÷ $100 = 5,000 customers
- If we achieve $200 per customer: $500K ÷ $200 = 2,500 customers

The range depends heavily on your average order value. Wellness brands with $30-50 products often hit the higher customer counts, while premium supplements ($100+ orders) typically see fewer but higher-value customers.

What's your typical customer order value? This will help us narrow down a realistic customer target for your $500K investment.

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Got it - brand awareness to drive customer acquisition in a new market. Let me help you set realistic targets.

For measurement, we need a primary number to track success. Since you want both awareness and customers, which would be your main success metric: number of new customers acquired, or total revenue from the West Coast launch?

Once we pick that, I can model what $500K typically achieves in the wellness space and help you set a realistic target.

Turn 5:
I'll model using 45% margin based on your estimate. On a $75 order, that equals approximately $34 profit per order.

**The math:** $77 acquisition cost vs $34 first-order profit = -$43 loss upfront

You're absolutely right - this depends on repeat purchases. For this to work, customers need to reorder enough to recover that initial loss. 

Based on wellness industry benchmarks, successful supplement brands typically see customers reorder 2-3 times in their first year, making the total customer value $150-240.

**Quick modeling:** If customers average 2.5 orders at $34 profit each = $85 total profit per customer. That would still be a $43 loss against your $77 acquisition cost.

For your target to work profitably, you'd need customers averaging 3+ orders, or you'd need to hit closer to $50-60 acquisition cost instead of $77.

Should we adjust the customer target down to improve the economics, or are you confident in higher repeat rates?

Turn 6:
Smart thinking - profitable growth beats unprofitable scale every time, especially for market entry.

**Conservative scenario:** $500K ÷ $50 = 10,000 customers (too aggressive)
**Realistic scenario:** $500K ÷ $60 = 8,333 customers 
**Safe scenario:** $500K ÷ $75 = 6,667 customers

At $60 per customer with your $34 profit margin, you'd lose $26 upfront but recover with just 1 reorder. Much healthier.

I'd recommend targeting **7,000 customers at $71 per customer**. Here's why:
- Only $37 loss upfront ($71 cost vs $34 profit)
- Breaks even with 2 reorders instead of 3+
- Gives you room to optimize down toward $60 as you learn
- Still meaningful scale for brand awareness

This feels right for market entry - prove the model works profitably before scaling aggressively.

Does **7,000 new customers at $71 acquisition cost** feel like the right balance of growth and safety?

Turn 7:
Perfect! 7,000 customers at $71 each gives you a solid foundation to build from.

**Confirmed plan:** $500K budget targeting 7,000 new West Coast customers with break-even at 2 reorders.

Now let's define your target audience. You mentioned "health-conscious people on the West Coast" - let's get more specific since tight targeting will be key to hitting that $71 efficiency.

What does your ideal customer look like? For example, what age range, income level, or lifestyle characteristics best describe someone likely to buy natural supplements and wellness products?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Excellent - with $75-80 average order value, you're positioned well for efficient acquisition.

$500K ÷ 6,500 customers = approximately $77 per customer

That $77 cost per customer is achievable for wellness brands in your price range. Based on industry benchmarks, supplement brands typically see $50-120 acquisition costs depending on competition and targeting precision.

Your target sits right in the sweet spot - not too aggressive, not too conservative. With strong creative and tight audience targeting on the West Coast, $77 per customer is realistic.

So we're modeling: **6,500 new customers at $77 per customer = $500K budget**

Now for economics - with customers paying $75-80 on average, can you afford to spend $77 to acquire each one? What's your profit margin on that typical $75-80 order?

Turn 9:
Perfect! That gives us a much sharper target. Active fitness/wellness enthusiasts who already buy premium health products and follow wellness content - that's exactly the precision we need for $71 efficiency.

Now let's get specific about geography within your West Coast launch. You mentioned California, Oregon, and Washington - but within those three states, are there particular cities or regions you want to prioritize?

For example, are you thinking major metro areas like LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland? Or do you want broader state coverage? The wellness market can vary significantly between urban coastal areas versus inland regions.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Excellent - that's a strong foundation. Health-conscious millennials and Gen Z with values-driven purchasing are prime for supplement brands.

Let me dig deeper on one key aspect: within that 25-40, health-conscious group, are there specific behaviors or interests that make someone MORE likely to buy? 

For example, do your best customers tend to be fitness enthusiasts, people with specific health concerns, wellness influencer followers, or those already buying other premium health products? 

The tighter we can define this, the better we'll hit that $71 target in a competitive wellness market.

Turn 10:
Smart approach - those four metros are wellness hotbeds with your exact target audience.

I'd recommend starting with the **top 4 metros plus their surrounding areas**: LA metro, SF Bay Area, Seattle metro, and Portland metro. This gives you concentrated reach without spreading too thin.

These four markets together represent about 25-30 million people, with high concentrations of your fitness-focused, values-driven target. Much better for hitting $71 efficiency than broad state coverage.

**Quick allocation thought:** LA metro is roughly 40% of your target population, SF Bay Area 25%, Seattle 20%, Portland 15%. 

Should we weight your $500K budget similarly - heaviest in LA, then SF, then Seattle and Portland? Or do you see reasons to allocate differently across these metros?

Turn 11:
Perfect! Population-weighted allocation is the smart starting point for a new market launch.

**Confirmed geography allocation:**
- LA metro: $200K (40%)
- SF Bay Area: $125K (25%) 
- Seattle metro: $100K (20%)
- Portland metro: $75K (15%)

This gives each market sufficient budget to generate meaningful data while focusing firepower where your audience is densest.

Now let's talk budget strategy. With your $500K total, how do you want to pace this over time? Are you thinking of spending it evenly over 12 months, front-loading to build awareness quickly, or do you have a specific timeline in mind for this West Coast launch?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 12:
Great question - timing strategy is crucial for new market entry.

For brand awareness in a new market, I typically recommend a **front-loaded approach** for two key reasons:

1. **Awareness threshold:** You need sufficient volume to break through the noise and get noticed initially
2. **Learning acceleration:** Heavier early spend generates data faster so you can optimize sooner

**Suggested pacing:** 60% in first 6 months, 40% in second 6 months
- Q1-Q2: $300K (build awareness, gather data)
- Q3-Q4: $200K (optimize based on learnings)

This gives you $50K per month early on for meaningful presence, then $33K monthly to sustain and refine.

Alternative is even $42K monthly, but that might not generate enough early signal in competitive wellness markets.

Does front-loading to establish presence faster appeal to you, or do you prefer the steady learning approach?
