# Media Plan Output: Mass National Campaign - Simplicity Test

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect setup for a national brand launch! $8M gives us serious reach potential for FreshBite. You mentioned brand awareness as the objective and brand lift as measurement, which is exactly right for a new product launch.

To nail down your success definition: what specific brand lift target are you aiming for? For example, are you targeting 5-point aided awareness lift, 3-point purchase intent lift, or a different benchmark that aligns with FreshBite's launch goals?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Great, 5-point aided awareness lift and 3-point purchase intent lift are solid targets for a new snack launch. Those benchmarks align well with successful CPG introductions.

Now for the volume piece: with $8M and those lift targets, what's your estimated reach goal? Are you thinking 50 million adults, 75 million, or a different target for how many people you want to expose to FreshBite messaging during the campaign?

Turn 4:
Perfect! 45 million reach at 3+ frequency is much more realistic for driving meaningful brand lift. $8M / 45 million = approximately $178 per person reached, which aligns well with national CPG benchmarks for effective frequency campaigns.

This approach should deliver the repetition needed to build FreshBite familiarity and hit your 5-point awareness lift target. The stronger frequency also supports purchase intent development.

Now let's move to economics. For brand campaigns, we typically track cost per point of awareness lift. Based on your $8M budget and 5-point target, that implies $1.6M per awareness point. Does that efficiency feel reasonable for a national snack launch, or do you have internal benchmarks for awareness campaign performance?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
$8M / 70 million people = approximately $114 per person reached. That's aggressive for national reach with meaningful frequency.

Based on CPG benchmarks, $8M typically delivers 40-50 million reach with 3+ frequency, or 60-70 million with lighter 2+ frequency. Your 60-75 million target is achievable but pushes toward the lighter frequency end.

For a new product launch, most successful campaigns prioritize 3+ frequency to build familiarity. Would you prefer 45 million people with stronger frequency, or stick with 70 million reach accepting lighter frequency? This impacts which mix of channels we'll need.

Turn 6:
Excellent - regular snack purchasers with $40K+ household income gives us much better targeting precision. Weekly+ purchase frequency and premium positioning are key signals.

Let me narrow this further: within that group, are there behavioral or lifestyle signals that define your ideal customer? For example, are you targeting health-conscious snackers, busy professionals, parents buying for families, or a different primary segment? This helps us identify the ~45 million highest-propensity people from that broader regular snacker base.

Turn 7:
Perfect! Health-conscious snackers who buy premium brands like Kind and RXBar - that's a well-defined, targetable segment. These are people who prioritize ingredient quality but want convenience and taste satisfaction.

This audience likely skews slightly higher income and education, shops at Whole Foods/Target/premium grocery, and engages with wellness content. They're also willing to pay more for better ingredients, which aligns perfectly with your premium positioning.

Now let's move to geography. You mentioned going national - are there specific regions where health-conscious snacking trends stronger, or do you want even coverage across all US markets? For example, coastal metros often show higher premium snack adoption rates.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Got it. I'll model using CPG snack benchmarks from industry studies. Typical cost per awareness point for national food launches runs $800K-$1.2M, so your $1.6M is on the higher end but not unrealistic for a first major launch.

The premium makes sense given you're building from zero brand recognition. Established brands benefit from existing awareness, while new products need that extra investment to break through. You can refine these benchmarks as you gather FreshBite-specific data.

Moving on, let's define your target audience more precisely. You mentioned adults 18-54 who buy snacks - that's about 140 million people. To hit 45 million efficiently, we need to focus on the highest-propensity segments. What defines your best snack buyer beyond age?

Turn 9:
Excellent! The 60/40 allocation gives us concentrated impact in premium metros while maintaining national brand presence. $4.8M in high-propensity markets should deliver strong frequency against health-conscious snackers, and $3.2M provides the coast-to-coast coverage FreshBite needs as a national launch.

Now let's move to your value proposition. You mentioned better-for-you snacks that don't sacrifice taste, targeting people who read ingredient lists but want satisfaction. What's FreshBite's specific differentiator? Are you organic, plant-based, low-sugar, high-protein, or a different functional benefit that sets you apart from Kind and RXBar?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Smart approach! Weighting toward high-propensity metros while maintaining national presence is textbook for premium CPG launches.

For geographic allocation, I'd typically recommend 60-70% of budget in top-performing DMAs (LA, SF, NYC, Boston, DC, Seattle, Austin, Denver) with remaining 30-40% providing lighter national coverage. 

$8M × 60% = $4.8M in premium metros, $3.2M for broader national reach. This concentrates firepower where health-conscious snackers cluster while still building coast-to-coast brand presence.

Does that 60/40 split feel right, or would you prefer a different balance between concentrated efficiency and broad national coverage?

Turn 10:
Perfect positioning! Air-crisping technology for 40% lower fat with satisfying crunch is a compelling functional benefit. "Clean ingredients without compromise on taste/texture" hits the sweet spot for health-conscious snackers who want familiar formats made better.

This differentiates nicely from protein bars (RXBar) and nut bars (Kind) - you're improving beloved snack categories rather than creating new ones. The "not too healthy tasting" insight is crucial for messaging.

Now for channel strategy. With $8M, 45 million reach at 3+ frequency, targeting health-conscious adults in weighted metros, we need channels that deliver scale with precision. Based on your audience and objectives, I'd recommend a video-heavy mix: Connected TV for premium reach, YouTube for engagement, some linear TV for broad awareness, plus digital display for frequency building.

Does that directional mix align with your thinking, or do you have channel preferences?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Excellent! Video is essential for demonstrating that satisfying crunch and air-crisping innovation - you can't communicate texture through static ads.

For allocation within that video-heavy mix, I'd suggest:
- 45% Connected TV ($3.6M) - Premium reach in target metros
- 25% YouTube ($2M) - Engagement and product demonstration  
- 20% Linear TV ($1.6M) - Broad national awareness
- 10% Digital Display ($800K) - Frequency building and retargeting

This prioritizes CTV for efficient premium audience reach while YouTube handles deeper engagement. Linear provides broad coverage, display fills frequency gaps.

Now for measurement beyond brand lift studies. With this mix, we should track video completion rates, brand search lift, and site traffic increases. Are there other success metrics FreshBite wants to monitor during the campaign?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 12:
Perfect! Brand search lift, social mentions, and creative optimization through completion rates give us a comprehensive measurement framework beyond the primary brand lift studies.

For testing strategy, I'd recommend launching with 2-3 creative executions - maybe one focused on the crunch/texture, one on the air-crisping innovation, and one on the clean ingredients story. We can optimize based on completion rates and brand search lift patterns.

We should also test CTV vs YouTube performance in week 2-3 to potentially rebalance if one channel significantly outperforms.

Finally, let's address risks. The main concerns I see: 1) New brand competing for attention in crowded snack space, 2) Demonstrating texture/crunch effectively in video, 3) Reaching 5-point awareness lift as first-time national advertiser. Are there other risks on FreshBite's radar that could impact campaign success?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 13:
Excellent point on seasonality - competitive snack launches definitely intensify the noise challenge. The concentrated metro approach and video-heavy mix should help FreshBite break through, but we'll want to monitor share of voice in those key markets.

Perfect! We've built a comprehensive plan:
- **Outcomes**: 5-point aided awareness, 3-point purchase intent lift
- **Economics**: $8M for 45M reach at 3+ frequency 
- **Audience**: Health-conscious snackers, premium buyers
- **Geography**: 60/40 split favoring premium metros
- **Channels**: Video-heavy mix led by CTV (45%), YouTube (25%), Linear TV (20%), Display (10%)
- **Measurement**: Brand lift studies + search lift + social mentions + creative optimization
- **Testing**: Multiple creative executions, early CTV/YouTube performance comparison
- **Risk mitigation**: Addressing crowded market, texture demonstration, seasonality competition

This gives FreshBite a strong foundation to launch nationally while efficiently targeting your best prospects. Ready to move forward with this strategic framework?
