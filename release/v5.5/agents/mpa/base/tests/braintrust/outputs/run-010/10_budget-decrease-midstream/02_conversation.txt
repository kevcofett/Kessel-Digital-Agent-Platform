TURN 1 (Step 1)

USER:
Hi, I'm VP of Demand Gen at DataScale Systems. We sell enterprise data infrastructure with an average deal size of $150K. I need to build a media plan for next year. We have $1M budget and need to generate 500 qualified opportunities. Our ICP is enterprise companies with 5000+ employees, targeting data and IT leaders.

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

$1M ÷ 500 opportunities = $2,000 per qualified opportunity. That's a solid efficiency target for enterprise software with your deal size.

Your business outcome is clear - generate qualified opportunities. How do you define "qualified opportunity" specifically? Is it MQL, SQL, or a specific scoring threshold?

TURN 2 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Good question - we define qualified opportunities as SQLs that have passed our BANT criteria. Basically, companies with 5000+ employees that have confirmed budget for data infrastructure projects and are in active evaluation mode. Our sales team has validated the technical fit and timeline. We're pretty strict on qualification since our sales cycle is long and we want high-intent prospects only.

AGENT:
Perfect - SQLs with validated BANT criteria is a strong qualification standard for enterprise sales. That $2,000 cost per SQL is aggressive but achievable for your deal size.

At $150K average deal value, even a 10% close rate would yield $15K revenue per SQL, giving you a healthy 7.5x return. Enterprise data infrastructure typically sees 15-25% SQL-to-close rates based on industry benchmarks.

What close rate are you modeling from SQL to closed-won? This will help us validate if the $2,000 efficiency target aligns with your unit economics.

TURN 3 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Honestly, our close rates have been all over the map this year - somewhere between 12-18% depending on the quarter. I'd say we're modeling around 15% to be conservative, which would put us at roughly $22.5K revenue per SQL. That math works pretty well for us, especially since we're also factoring in upsell potential down the line. Our existing customers typically expand by 40-50% within 18 months.

AGENT:
Excellent - 15% close rate gives you $22.5K revenue per SQL, making your $2,000 target very healthy at 11x return. With 40-50% expansion, the lifetime value is even stronger.

$1M budget ÷ 500 SQLs = $2,000 per SQL is definitely achievable for enterprise software, though it will require precise targeting and efficient channels. Based on enterprise data infrastructure benchmarks, this sits in the "tight but realistic" range - you'll need strong audience definition and channel efficiency to hit it consistently.

Perfect - we've established solid economics. Now let's define your audience precisely. You mentioned 5000+ employees targeting data and IT leaders. Which specific titles are you prioritizing - Chief Data Officer, VP of Data Engineering, IT Director, or others?

TURN 4 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're primarily targeting VP and Director level - VP of Data Engineering, Director of Data Architecture, and VP of IT Infrastructure are our sweet spots. CDOs are great when we can reach them, but they're harder to find and often more strategic than tactical. We also see good results with Principal Data Engineers who have budget influence, especially at tech companies where the hierarchy is flatter. 

The key is finding people who are hands-on enough to understand our technical differentiation but senior enough to have budget authority or strong influence on the buying committee.

AGENT:
Excellent targeting strategy - VP/Director level gives you that perfect balance of technical understanding and budget influence. Principal Data Engineers at tech companies is a smart addition given their outsized influence in flatter orgs.

So we're targeting:
- VP of Data Engineering  
- Director of Data Architecture
- VP of IT Infrastructure
- CDO (when reachable)
- Principal Data Engineers (especially at tech companies)

All at companies 5000+ employees. 

What geographic focus do you have? Are you targeting specific regions, or is this a national campaign? Also, do you have any industry verticals that convert particularly well for your data infrastructure solutions?

TURN 5 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're focusing on US, UK, and Germany - those are our core markets where we have strong sales coverage and localized support. About 70% of our budget will be US-focused since that's our largest market.

For verticals, we see really strong performance in financial services and retail - they have massive data volumes and complex infrastructure needs that play to our strengths. Tech companies are obviously a natural fit too, especially SaaS platforms dealing with scale challenges. Healthcare and manufacturing have been tougher nuts to crack, so we're probably going to dial back investment there for now.

AGENT:
Perfect - US (70%), UK, and Germany with strong vertical focus. Financial services, retail, and tech companies are smart priorities given their data complexity and your proven performance there.

So your core audience is:
- VP/Director level data and IT leaders + Principal Data Engineers
- 5000+ employee companies  
- Financial services, retail, and tech verticals
- US (70% budget), UK, Germany

At $2,000 per SQL targeting this precise audience, you'll need tight channel efficiency. Enterprise audiences of this seniority typically require multiple touchpoints and longer nurture cycles.

Now for budget allocation - you mentioned $700K for US and $300K split between UK and Germany. How are you thinking about the UK/Germany split, and do you have different efficiency expectations by region?

TURN 6 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're thinking roughly 60/40 split between UK and Germany - so maybe $180K UK and $120K Germany. The UK market is more mature for us and English-language content obviously scales better, but Germany has been showing really strong intent signals lately, especially in financial services.

I'd expect slightly higher acquisition costs in Germany due to language localization and the fact that we're still building brand awareness there. Maybe 20-30% higher cost per SQL compared to US benchmarks. UK should be closer to US efficiency since we've got good market presence already. Does that sound reasonable for European expansion?

AGENT:
That allocation makes perfect sense - $700K US, $180K UK, $120K Germany. Your efficiency expectations are spot-on based on market maturity.

Modeling your targets:
- US: $700K ÷ $2,000 = 350 SQLs
- UK: $180K ÷ $2,000 = 90 SQLs  
- Germany: $120K ÷ $2,600 (30% higher) = ~46 SQLs
- Total: ~486 SQLs (close to your 500 target)

The German premium for localization and brand building is realistic. UK efficiency matching US makes sense given your established presence.

Now let's nail your value proposition. With enterprise data infrastructure, what's your core differentiation that resonates most with these VP/Director level buyers? Is it performance, cost efficiency, ease of implementation, or something else that drives their evaluation?

TURN 7 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our biggest differentiator is actually our unified data orchestration platform - we eliminate the need for multiple point solutions that most enterprises are cobbling together. When VPs are dealing with 5-8 different data tools that don't talk to each other, we can consolidate that into a single platform that reduces both complexity and total cost of ownership.

Performance is definitely part of it - we're seeing 3-5x faster query times compared to legacy systems - but the real hook is operational efficiency. These leaders are tired of managing vendor sprawl and want to reduce their team's cognitive load. Our messaging around "one platform, infinite scale" really resonates because it speaks to both the technical performance and the business outcome of simplified operations.

AGENT:
"One platform, infinite scale" - that's a compelling value prop that hits both technical and business pain points. Eliminating vendor sprawl while delivering 3-5x performance gains gives you strong ROI messaging for budget-conscious VPs.

Your unified orchestration story should resonate well across all three geos, especially in financial services where regulatory compliance makes vendor management critical.

Perfect - we've got solid economics ($2,000 per SQL), precise audience (VP/Director level at 5000+ employee companies), clear geography (US/UK/Germany), realistic budget allocation, and strong value proposition around platform consolidation.

Now for channels. Given your enterprise audience and complex sale, what channels are you currently using, and which have driven your best SQL quality? This will help us optimize your mix for next year.

TURN 8 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Right now we're heavily invested in LinkedIn - probably 40% of our current spend. The targeting capabilities for enterprise audiences are unmatched, and we're seeing good engagement with our thought leadership content around data architecture best practices. ABM campaigns through LinkedIn have been particularly strong for reaching those VP-level decision makers.

We're also doing some programmatic display and retargeting, mainly through tech publications and industry sites where our audience hangs out. Trade shows and webinars have been solid for lead quality, though the volume is obviously more limited. Email nurture sequences perform well once we get people into the funnel, but cold outreach has been hit or miss depending on the list quality. What channels would you recommend we lean into more heavily for next year's plan?

AGENT:
LinkedIn at 40% makes perfect sense for your enterprise audience - the targeting precision for VP/Director level is unmatched, and ABM campaigns align perfectly with your high-value, long-cycle sales process.

Based on your $2,000 per SQL target and proven channels, I'd recommend this allocation:

**LinkedIn (45% - $450K)**: Increase investment in what's working. Scale ABM and add LinkedIn Events for webinar promotion.

**Programmatic Display (25% - $250K)**: Expand beyond retargeting to include prospecting on B2B tech sites and industry publications.

**Search (20% - $200K)**: Capture intent with branded and competitor terms, plus high-intent keywords like "data orchestration platform."

**Events/Content (10% - $100K)**: Trade shows, webinars, and sponsored content on industry sites.

This mix prioritizes proven performance while adding search to capture active evaluation behavior. The 45% LinkedIn allocation gives you scale while maintaining efficiency.

How does this channel allocation align with your current performance data and comfort level?
