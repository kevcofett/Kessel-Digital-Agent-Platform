# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience with Segment-Specific Channels

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I am excited to build a media plan with you. We will cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

$5M / 50,000 = $100 per enrollment. That's efficient for online learning, especially with your sophisticated segment approach.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 50,000 enrollments - revenue growth, market expansion, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect. $50M revenue from 50,000 enrollments equals $1,000 average course value - strong unit economics for online education.

Your $100 acquisition cost against $1,000 average value projects to a healthy 10x LTV/CAC ratio. Based on online education benchmarks, that's excellent efficiency.

Quick validation: With Career Changers in premium programs and Gen Z in starter courses building LTV over time, does that $1,000 blended average feel realistic, or should we model different values by segment?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Perfect targeting profile. Career Changers seeking future-proof skills with 3-5 year tenure signals create highly qualified audiences.

Those behavioral signals - automation concerns, salary ceiling research, career development content consumption - give us precise targeting opportunities, especially on LinkedIn where professional intent is visible.

Moving to College-Age learners - beyond TikTok and Instagram, what specific triggers indicate they're considering alternatives to traditional college? Are they researching specific career paths, concerned about student debt, or influenced by particular types of creator content?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent breakdown. Your segment economics make sense:
- Career Changers: $2,000-3,000 immediate value, $100 CAC = 20-30x efficiency
- College-Age: $400-600 initial, building to $1,200-2,400 LTV = 12-24x efficiency  
- Corporate L&D: $800-1,200 per seat, enterprise multiplier effect

All three segments show strong unit economics well above typical 3-5x benchmarks for sustainable growth.

Now let's define your audiences more precisely. Starting with Career Changers - beyond the demographics and LinkedIn usage, what specific behavioral or professional signals indicate someone is ready to upskill? For example, recent job changes, industry transitions, or specific career frustrations?

Turn 6:
Perfect. Corporate L&D segment driven by workforce readiness pressure, retention economics, and digital transformation urgency creates clear value propositions.

Skills gaps plus recruitment cost avoidance versus upskilling investment makes compelling ROI cases for decision-makers.

Your geography strategy looks well-targeted:
- Career Changers: Tech hubs where salary ceilings and automation concerns are most acute
- College-Age: National with college town/urban focus where debt anxiety peaks
- Corporate L&D: Corporate HQ cities where decision-makers concentrate

Does this geographic approach align with where you see strongest demand signals, or should we refine any regional priorities?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Excellent. College-Age segment is ROI-focused with strong social proof influence - debt anxiety plus creator validation creates powerful motivation.

The "get a tech job without a degree" and income showcase content gives us clear content partnership and influencer targeting strategies.

For Corporate L&D decision-makers - what specific business challenges or triggers indicate they're ready to invest in employee development? Are they responding to skills gaps, retention issues, digital transformation needs, or competitive pressures?

Turn 7:
Excellent geographic validation. Adding Atlanta, Dallas, and Phoenix for Corporate L&D makes strategic sense - those expansion markets often have the steepest skills gaps.

Now for budget allocation across your three segments. With $5M total budget and distinct efficiency profiles:

- Career Changers: Premium programs, tight geographic focus, $100 CAC against $2,000+ value
- College-Age: Lower initial value but national scale, creator partnerships  
- Corporate L&D: Enterprise deals with highest multiplier effect but longer cycles

How would you initially allocate the $5M across these three segments, or should I model based on the enrollment targets and efficiency assumptions?

Turn 8:
Your allocation instincts align well with the economics. Let me model this:

**40% Career Changers = $2M budget**
$2M / $100 CAC = 20,000 enrollments at $2,500 avg = $50M segment revenue

**35% College-Age = $1.75M budget** 
$1.75M / $100 CAC = 17,500 enrollments at $500 initial = $8.75M immediate revenue

**25% Corporate L&D = $1.25M budget**
$1.25M / $100 CAC = 12,500 seats at $1,000 avg = $12.5M segment revenue

This projects to $71.25M total revenue versus your $50M target - suggesting either conservative CAC assumptions or opportunity for efficiency optimization.

The allocation balances immediate revenue (Career Changers) with scale (College-Age) and enterprise multiplier (Corporate L&D).

What's your primary value proposition for Career Changers - future-proofing against automation, salary advancement, or career pivot enablement?

Turn 9:
Much more realistic CAC assumptions. Let me recalculate with your refined numbers:

**Career Changers at $175 CAC:**
$2M / $175 = 11,429 enrollments at $2,500 = $28.6M revenue

**College-Age at $87.50 CAC:**
$1.75M / $87.50 = 20,000 enrollments at $500 = $10M immediate revenue

**Corporate L&D at $250 CAC:**
$1.25M / $250 = 5,000 seats at $1,000 = $5M revenue

Total: $43.6M revenue - much closer to your $50M target when factoring in College-Age LTV growth and Corporate enterprise multipliers.

Salary advancement value prop is smart - immediate ROI beats future-proofing for driving enrollment decisions.

For College-Age segment, what's your core value proposition - career speed, debt avoidance, or practical skills over theory?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 10:
Perfect. Career speed with immediate employability beats debt avoidance for driving action - "start earning while friends study" is powerful positioning.

The practical skills angle differentiates nicely from traditional education's theoretical approach.

For Corporate L&D, what's your primary value proposition - solving skills gaps, improving retention, accelerating digital transformation, or reducing recruitment costs?

Turn 13:
Great insights. Authentic transformation stories outperform lifestyle content for driving actual enrollments - substance over style resonates with ROI-focused Gen Z.

TikTok's "retail to data analyst" progression content clearly works better than Instagram aspiration for conversion.

For Corporate L&D targeting retention-focused decision-makers, I'd recommend:
- LinkedIn ABM campaigns targeting HR/L&D titles at target company sizes
- Sponsored content in trade publications (HR Executive, Chief Learning Officer)
- Programmatic targeting C-suite + HR decision-makers on business sites
- Direct mail + digital sequences for enterprise prospects
- Webinar campaigns showcasing retention ROI case studies

Given the longer B2B cycles and enterprise deal sizes, what channels have generated your best Corporate L&D pipeline?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 11:
Excellent. Retention economics with $50K+ replacement costs versus $2-3K upskilling creates compelling CFO-level ROI arguments.

"Keep your best people by giving them growth paths" frames employee development as competitive retention strategy, not just training expense.

Now let's build your channel strategy. Starting with Career Changers in tech hubs focused on salary advancement:

Given their LinkedIn-heavy behavior, business podcast consumption, and research-driven approach, I'd recommend:
- LinkedIn Sponsored Content targeting job tenure + skill research signals
- Podcast advertising on business/tech shows with ROI-focused creative
- Search campaigns for "salary increase" + skill-specific terms
- Retargeting with salary benchmarking content

What channels have worked best for reaching Career Changers in your experience?

Turn 12:
Strong channel validation. LinkedIn's precision targeting plus programmatic display at career research moments creates powerful intent capture.

The career-focused creative in programmatic makes sense - catching them during salary research when ROI messaging hits hardest.

For College-Age targeting TikTok/Instagram with career speed messaging, I'd recommend:
- TikTok creator partnerships with "day in my life" tech professionals
- Instagram influencer campaigns showcasing income/lifestyle outcomes  
- Social video content: "6 months to first tech job" success stories
- Snapchat and YouTube targeting college-age with career anxiety signals

What's worked best for reaching Gen Z learners, and have you tested creator partnerships yet?

Turn 18:
Perfect! You've built a robust, segment-specific strategy that leverages proven channels while addressing real market dynamics.

Your execution priorities are exactly right - creative testing will drive immediate performance gains, and proper incrementality measurement will protect against attribution inflation as you scale.

The portfolio effect you mentioned is particularly smart - Career Changer demand increasing during economic uncertainty helps balance Corporate L&D budget volatility.

You're well-positioned to execute this plan successfully. The combination of realistic economics, proven channel-audience fit, and systematic testing approach should deliver strong results while building sustainable competitive advantages.

Good luck with the rollout!

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 14:
Excellent validation. LinkedIn ABM plus content syndication for active researchers creates strong pipeline foundation.

Peer validation through client case study webinars is smart - removes sales pitch skepticism and provides credible retention ROI proof.

Budget cycle timing for direct mail + digital sequences shows sophisticated B2B understanding.

Your channel strategy across segments looks strong:
- **Career Changers**: LinkedIn + programmatic display + podcasts
- **College-Age**: TikTok transformation stories + YouTube pre-roll  
- **Corporate L&D**: LinkedIn ABM + content syndication + peer webinars

For measurement, given the different attribution challenges across B2C and B2B segments, how are you currently tracking success - platform attribution, incrementality testing, or unified analytics?

Turn 15:
Smart measurement approach. Platform attribution for direct response segments plus incrementality testing for upper-funnel makes sense given attribution limitations.

Influenced pipeline tracking for Corporate L&D is exactly right - long B2B cycles break last-touch models. Webinar attendance as leading indicator shows good conversion funnel understanding.

Geo-holdout tests for programmatic and social incrementality are gold standard. Your attribution stack gaps are common - most companies struggle with unified cross-segment analytics.

For testing, what's your priority - optimizing creative performance within segments, testing new channels, or improving cross-segment attribution? Given your sophisticated approach, I'd recommend starting with creative testing since you have strong channel foundations already established.

Turn 16:
Excellent testing priorities. Creative optimization with established channels will drive immediate ROI improvements.

**Career Changers**: Test specific dollar amounts versus percentages - "$20K salary increase" often outperforms "40% raise" because concrete numbers feel more achievable and specific.

**College-Age TikTok**: Skills demonstration videos showing actual work output could outperform transformation stories - "watch me build this dashboard" proves capability versus just claiming outcomes.

**Corporate L&D**: Retention ROI creative with specific replacement costs - "Save $50K per employee versus hiring" - plus peer testimonial quotes from your webinar clients.

Final area: What risks concern you most - economic downturn affecting Corporate L&D budgets, increased competition for Career Changer attention, or platform changes affecting College-Age reach?

Turn 17:
Smart risk assessment. Economic downturn creating opposite effects - Corporate L&D budget cuts versus Career Changer motivation spikes - requires scenario planning.

30% LinkedIn CPC inflation shows competitive pressure is real. Maintaining creative differentiation and targeting precision beats bidding wars for sustainable economics.

Your media plan is sophisticated and well-reasoned:
- **Realistic CACs** by segment ($175/$87.50/$250)
- **Channel-audience fit** based on proven performance
- **Clear testing roadmap** focused on creative optimization
- **Economic risk mitigation** through portfolio diversification

You've built a strong foundation. The creative testing priorities - specific salary amounts, TikTok skills demos, and Corporate retention ROI messaging - should drive immediate performance improvements while protecting against competitive CPC inflation.

Ready to execute this plan?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 19:
Excellent! The structured segment approach really highlighted how different your audiences are - forcing one strategy across Career Changers, College-Age, and Corporate L&D would have left significant performance on the table.

Definitely circle back with those creative test results. The salary amount versus percentage test will be particularly telling since concrete numbers often outperform percentages in performance marketing, but your audience's research-driven behavior might respond differently.

The TikTok skills demonstration versus transformation story test could be a game-changer - proving capability through demonstration rather than just claiming outcomes aligns perfectly with Gen Z's skepticism of traditional marketing.

Looking forward to hearing how the plan performs. You've got a solid foundation to hit that $50M target!

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 20:
You're absolutely right - forcing shared tactics would have diluted effectiveness across all three segments. Each audience's media consumption, decision-making process, and value drivers are fundamentally different.

That's a great insight about Career Changers potentially preferring percentage specificity for their own calculations. Research-driven audiences often want the data points to run their own ROI analysis rather than having conclusions handed to them.

And yes, Gen Z's authenticity radar is incredibly sharp. Skills demonstration content should build genuine credibility versus transformation claims that could feel manufactured.

The strategic framework approach beats broad-brush every time - especially when you're operating across such distinct audience behaviors and economics. You've got a clear execution path that respects each segment's unique characteristics while maintaining overall campaign coherence.

Excited to see how this performs in market!
