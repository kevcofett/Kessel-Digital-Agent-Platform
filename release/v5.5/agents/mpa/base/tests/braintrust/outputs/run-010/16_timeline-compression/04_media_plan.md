# Media Plan Output: Timeline Compression

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start - you've given me great foundation data. Let me quickly check your efficiency target:

$1.2M ÷ 25,000 = $48 per customer acquisition

At $180 LTV, that's a healthy 3.75x LTV/CAC ratio, which is strong for fashion retail where 3-4x is typical.

Now for outcomes: Beyond acquiring 25,000 new customers, what's the primary business outcome you're trying to achieve? For example, is this about hitting a specific revenue target, expanding market share, or supporting a product launch?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Excellent - market expansion into tier 2 cities with a sustainable collection launch. That's a dual-objective campaign with clear growth intent.

Let me verify the revenue math: 25,000 customers × $180 LTV = $4.5M. Perfect alignment.

For measurement, what's your primary success metric? Since you have both expansion and awareness goals, I want to make sure we're tracking what matters most. Are you measuring success primarily by:

- New customer count (the 25,000 target)
- Revenue from new customers (the $4.5M)
- Market penetration in tier 2 cities
- Or something else that captures both expansion and awareness?

This determines how we structure measurement and optimization throughout the year.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Perfect! Primary KPI is 25,000 new customers, with tier 2 market penetration as secondary, plus brand awareness tracking for the sustainable collection.

Your economics look solid - $48 CAC at $180 LTV gives you healthy 3.75x efficiency, which is achievable for fashion retail based on typical benchmarks.

One quick check on your $48 CAC target: Fashion retail typically sees $35-65 CAC depending on channels and audience precision. Your target sits right in the sweet spot. Since you're expanding into new tier 2 markets where you may have less brand recognition, we might see slightly higher acquisition costs initially, but $48 gives us good buffer.

Ready to move to audience definition - who exactly are you targeting in these tier 2 cities?

Turn 4:
Great audience foundation! Fashion-forward women 25-45 who care about sustainability in tier 2 cities. Let me dig deeper on a few key signals to sharpen targeting precision.

For behavioral targeting, which of these signals are most important for identifying your ideal customers:

- Recent fashion/apparel purchases online
- Engagement with sustainability content or eco-friendly brands
- Following specific fashion influencer categories
- Shopping behavior patterns (frequency, price points)
- Or lifestyle indicators like career-focused, urban professionals

This helps us build lookalike audiences and optimize for the highest-converting segments within that 25-45 demographic.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Excellent prioritization! Sustainability engagement + online fashion purchases + conscious fashion influencers + urban professionals gives us strong targeting precision.

Now for geography - which specific tier 2 cities are you targeting? This matters for budget allocation, local influencer partnerships, and understanding market size. Are you looking at cities like Pune, Chandigarh, Kochi, or different markets entirely?

Also, are you planning to hit all target cities simultaneously, or phase the rollout over the 12 months?

Turn 6:
Perfect! US tier 2 cities with phased rollout - Austin, Nashville, Portland, Denver, Charlotte are excellent choices with strong fashion-conscious demographics.

Your phased approach is smart for optimization. 2-3 cities per quarter lets you:
- Concentrate budget for meaningful impact per market
- Learn channel performance before scaling
- Adjust messaging based on regional response

Quick market sizing check: These 5 metros combined have roughly 8-12 million people. Your target demo (fashion-forward women 25-45 with disposable income) likely represents 800K-1.2M addressable audience across all markets.

At 25,000 customers across 5 cities over 12 months, you're targeting roughly 2-3% penetration of addressable audience, which is ambitious but achievable.

Now for budget: How do you want to allocate that $1.2M? Are you thinking equal splits across cities, or do you want to weight certain markets based on size or opportunity?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Perfect positioning! "Elevated everyday fashion for the modern woman" with sustainability as a differentiator, not the lead. That's smart for market entry - style first builds credibility, then sustainability adds value.

The office-to-weekend versatility angle is brilliant for your urban professional target. Quality + versatility justifies premium pricing and builds LTV.

Your value prop framework:
- Primary: Elevated everyday fashion for modern women
- Secondary: Sustainable without sacrificing style  
- Proof points: Office-to-weekend versatility, quality construction
- Emotional benefit: Confidence in any setting

This gives us strong creative direction and helps justify that $180 LTV through quality positioning.

Ready for channels? Based on your objectives (market expansion + awareness), audience (social-savvy, fashion-forward), and value prop (style-first), what channels are you considering? I want to understand your initial thinking before we optimize the mix.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 7:
Excellent allocation strategy! Let me map this out:

Austin: 25% = $300K
Denver: 25% = $300K  
Nashville: 20% = $240K
Charlotte: 20% = $240K
Portland: 10% = $120K

This projects to roughly:
- Austin/Denver: 6,250 customers each at $48 CAC
- Nashville/Charlotte: 5,000 customers each at $48 CAC  
- Portland: 2,500 customers at $48 CAC

Smart to overweight Austin and Denver for their fashion-forward demos, and Portland's smaller allocation makes sense for testing sustainability messaging.

The phased approach gives you budget flexibility - if Austin performs exceptionally in Q1, you can reallocate from later markets.

Now let's define your value proposition. With market expansion AND sustainable collection launch, how do you want to position Urban Essentials to these new audiences who may not know your brand yet?

Turn 9:
Excellent channel thinking! You've identified the right mix for fashion discovery and demand capture. Let me analyze this strategically:

**Strong foundation:** Instagram + TikTok for discovery, Google for intent capture, influencer for credibility, display for retargeting. This covers the full funnel well.

**Key considerations for your mix:**

Instagram/TikTok will need 60-70% of budget since that's where fashion discovery happens, but Google becomes critical in tier 2 markets where brand search volume is low initially.

**Budget efficiency check:** At $1.2M across 5 channels, you need minimum $150-200K per major platform to exit learning phases and optimize effectively. 

**Critical question:** For influencer partnerships, are you thinking macro-influencers for reach, micro-influencers for authenticity, or a mix? This affects both budget allocation and measurement approach, especially for that brand awareness lift you want to track.

The sustainable collection launch timing will also affect channel sequencing - when does that collection drop?

Turn 10:
Smart influencer split! 70% micro for trust and engagement, 30% macro for reach in new markets. That balance works perfectly for both objectives.

March sustainable collection launch with February awareness build is excellent timing for Q1 cities (Austin/Denver launch markets).

**Budget allocation recommendation:**
- Instagram/TikTok: ~50% ($600K)
- Google: ~25% ($300K) 
- Influencer: ~15% ($180K)
- Display: ~10% ($120K)

This gives each channel sufficient budget to optimize while prioritizing discovery platforms.

**Measurement approach:** For brand awareness tracking you mentioned, I'd recommend pre/post surveys in each market launch, plus social listening for sustainable collection buzz. Instagram/TikTok provide good engagement metrics, but we'll need incrementality testing to validate true lift.

**Critical measurement question:** How sophisticated is your current attribution setup? Do you have MMM (media mix modeling) capability, or are you relying primarily on platform attribution? This affects how we track cross-channel impact, especially for upper-funnel awareness driving lower-funnel conversions.
