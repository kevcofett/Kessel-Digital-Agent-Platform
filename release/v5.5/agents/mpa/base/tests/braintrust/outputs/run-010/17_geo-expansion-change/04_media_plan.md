# Media Plan Output: Geography Expansion Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've given me great initial context - $2.5M budget targeting 500,000 combined visits and conversions. Before we dive into the economics, I need to clarify your primary business outcome. Are you focused on driving immediate sales revenue, building brand awareness and consideration, or acquiring new customers for long-term value?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect! Revenue generation as the primary outcome with new customer acquisition as secondary. Let me clarify how you'll measure success as a number.

When you say "strong ROAS," what specific return target are you aiming for? For example, are you targeting 4:1 ROAS (meaning $4 in revenue for every $1 spent), or do you have a different benchmark in mind?

This will help us determine if your $2.5M budget can realistically drive the revenue needed to hit both your ROAS target and your 500,000 visit/conversion goal.

Turn 3:
Great! Let me run the math on your targets to see if they align:

**Your efficiency target:** $2.5M ÷ 500,000 = $5 per visit/conversion

**Revenue projection at 3:1 ROAS:** $2.5M × 3 = $7.5M total revenue needed

**That means:** $7.5M ÷ $180 AOV = 41,667 actual purchases required

Here's the reality check: You need 500,000 visits/conversions but only 41,667 need to purchase. That's about an 8.3% conversion rate across all touchpoints, which is aggressive but achievable for athletic apparel with strong targeting.

At 4:1 ROAS, you'd need $10M revenue = 55,556 purchases, requiring about 11% conversion rate.

Based on industry benchmarks, athletic apparel typically sees 2-4% conversion rates for cold traffic and 8-15% for warm audiences. Your targets are realistic IF you have strong first-party data and focus heavily on qualified traffic.

Do you have customer data for lookalike targeting, or will you be primarily prospecting to cold audiences?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Smart thinking! Your 50,000 customer base gives you solid lookalike foundation, which definitely improves feasibility. Let me model a more realistic scenario:

**Conservative breakdown:**
- Warm audiences (lookalikes, retargeting): ~30% of traffic at 12-18% conversion
- Cold prospecting: ~70% of traffic at 3-5% conversion

This projects closer to 6-8% blended conversion rate, meaning you'd hit roughly 30,000-40,000 purchases = $5.4M-$7.2M revenue = 2.2-2.9x ROAS.

**Path to your 3:1+ target:**
You could adjust the volume target to ~350,000 visits/conversions, which would give you $7.1 per visitor and better efficiency. Or allocate 20-30% budget to upper-funnel brand building to improve cold audience performance over time.

The athletic apparel space is competitive - brands hitting consistent 3:1+ typically have either premium pricing power or exceptionally tight audience targeting.

What's more important to leadership: hitting the 500K volume number or achieving the 3:1 ROAS minimum? This affects whether we optimize for reach or efficiency.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Excellent decision! Prioritizing efficiency over volume is the right call for long-term growth. Let's lock in your revised targets:

**Updated targets:** 350,000 visits/conversions at 3:1+ ROAS minimum
**Implied efficiency:** $2.5M ÷ 350,000 = $7.14 per visit/conversion

This gives you much healthier margins and room to optimize. At $7.14 per visitor with your $180 AOV, you need about 6% blended conversion rate - totally achievable with your customer data foundation.

**Economics look solid now.** With 30,000+ purchases projected, you're looking at $5.4M+ revenue = 2.16x minimum ROAS with upside to 3:1+ as optimization improves.

Perfect, your outcomes and economics are realistic and defensible. Now let's move to Step 3 - defining your audience precisely. You mentioned "active adults 25-45" but we need to get much more specific for media targeting.

What behavioral signals or lifestyle indicators best identify your highest-value customers beyond just age and activity level?

Turn 6:
Perfect! Those are strong behavioral signals. Let me capture the key targeting criteria:

**Primary audience profile:**
- Committed fitness enthusiasts (not casual gym-goers)
- Specific activities: running, CrossFit, yoga, cycling
- $75K+ household income (premium positioning)
- Social media active, especially Instagram + fitness apps
- Values performance and quality over price
- Omnichannel shoppers (online + retail)

This gives us excellent targeting precision for platforms like Meta and Google. The fitness app engagement is particularly valuable for programmatic targeting.

Quick follow-up: Within this group, do you see any meaningful differences between your male vs. female customers in terms of preferred activities, shopping behavior, or price sensitivity? Or any age skews within the 25-45 range that perform better?

This will help determine if we need separate audience segments or can target this as one cohesive group.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Excellent geographic insights! Those markets align perfectly with your premium fitness positioning. Let me capture the key geographic priorities:

**Tier 1 markets (highest priority):**
- Store presence: LA, San Francisco, Denver, Austin, Chicago, Northeast corridor
- Strong outdoor recreation cultures: Colorado, California markets
- Higher disposable income + fitness-focused demographics

This geographic concentration is actually advantageous for your budget efficiency. Rather than spreading $2.5M thin across all 210 DMAs, you can concentrate spend in your highest-performing markets for better frequency and local market dominance.

Quick question on geographic allocation: Are you thinking roughly equal investment across these top markets, or should we weight spend based on factors like store count, historical performance, or market size? For example, should LA/SF get heavier investment than Austin given market size, or does Austin's outdoor culture make it equally valuable?

This will help determine if we allocate budget by market size or opportunity.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 7:
Absolutely! These differences are significant enough to warrant separate audience segments. Here's what I'm seeing:

**Three distinct segments:**
1. **Female fitness enthusiasts 25-45** - Higher engagement, repeat purchase behavior, yoga/running focus
2. **Male fitness enthusiasts 30-40** - CrossFit/cycling focus, highest AOV potential  
3. **Established premium buyers 40+** - In-store preference, performance-focused

The 25-29 group's price sensitivity might conflict with your premium positioning and 3:1 ROAS targets, so I'd recommend focusing on the higher-value segments initially.

Each segment will likely need different creative messaging and potentially different channel emphasis - females responding better to social, older customers preferring more traditional touchpoints.

Now for geography - you mentioned US market. Are you planning national coverage, or do you have specific regions, cities, or DMAs where ActiveWear Pro performs particularly well? Your store locations might also influence geographic strategy.

Turn 9:
Perfect allocation strategy! That 40/35/25 split balances scale with opportunity beautifully. Let me structure this:

**Geographic allocation framework:**
- **Tier 1 (40% = $1M):** LA, SF, Chicago, Northeast corridor - Scale + store presence
- **Tier 2 (35% = $875K):** Denver, Austin + similar outdoor culture markets - High engagement efficiency  
- **Tier 3 (25% = $625K):** Secondary market testing - Growth opportunity

This concentration strategy should deliver better frequency and market penetration than spreading nationally. Your outdoor recreation markets are smart - they typically have higher ActiveWear engagement and less price sensitivity.

**Geography complete!** Now let's move to budget allocation. You've got the overall $2.5M and geographic splits. The next question is how to allocate across your three audience segments:

Between Female fitness enthusiasts, Male fitness enthusiasts 30-40, and Established premium buyers 40+, which segment should get the largest budget allocation based on your current performance data?
