# Media Plan Output: Channel Mix Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

I can see you're launching an organic snack line with strong budget capacity. Before we dive into channels and reach, let's establish the foundation. What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with this launch - are you focused on brand awareness, trial generation, or driving immediate sales velocity?

Turn 2:
Perfect, a dual-objective approach makes sense for a new category entry. For measurement, how will you define success numerically? 

For awareness, are you targeting a specific percentage of aided or unaided brand awareness among your target households? And for trial, what's your target number of first-time purchasers or trial volume you need to achieve?

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using $13.50 average transaction value based on your range and category benchmarks. At $15-19 acquisition cost versus $13.50 transaction value, you'd need strong repeat purchase rates to achieve profitability - typical for trial-focused launches.

This works if customers return within 60-90 days, which premium organic snacks often achieve with 40-60% repeat rates. You can refine these numbers anytime.

Your efficiency target is realistic for the category. Now let's define your audience precisely. You mentioned health-conscious families - can you describe the primary household decision-maker you're targeting? For example, are we talking about millennial moms with young kids, or does it span broader demographics?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent targets. Let me run the economics on your trial goal: $3M budget targeting 160,000-200,000 first-time purchasers equals $15-19 per trial acquisition. 

That's aggressive but achievable for premium organic snacks, especially with strong retail distribution already secured. Most CPG trial campaigns in this category run $20-40 per trial, so you'll need efficient targeting and compelling creative.

Before we move to audience definition, what's the average transaction value when someone tries your snacks? Understanding customer value helps validate whether $15-19 acquisition cost creates positive unit economics from the start.

Turn 5:
Perfect, that's a well-defined primary target. Millennial and Gen X moms (28-45) with school-age kids (5-15) who prioritize family health creates a focused audience foundation.

What additional signals help identify these health-conscious families beyond demographics? For example, do they shop at specific retailers, follow certain lifestyle patterns, or show particular behaviors that indicate they'd be receptive to premium organic snacks?

These behavioral and psychographic signals will help us target more precisely and improve that $15-19 acquisition efficiency.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Excellent audience definition. You've identified strong behavioral signals - organic retail shopping, wellness content engagement, premium brand affinity, and active lifestyle patterns. These signals will enable precise targeting across channels.

Now for geography - are you planning national coverage, or do certain markets align better with your health-conscious family audience? For example, do you see stronger performance potential in markets with higher organic food penetration or specific demographic concentrations?

Turn 7:
Smart approach - national coverage with strategic weighting makes sense given your retail commitments and growth objectives.

Let me structure your geography strategy with high-performing organic markets getting increased investment while maintaining national presence. I'll break this into three tiers:

**Tier 1 (Heavy Weight):** Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Denver, Austin, Boston, NYC, DC - high organic penetration markets

**Tier 2 (Standard Weight):** Secondary metros with growing health-conscious populations 

**Tier 3 (Maintenance Weight):** Remaining national coverage to support retail partnerships

Would you prefer to allocate roughly 50% of budget to Tier 1 markets, 35% to Tier 2, and 15% to Tier 3? Or do you have different weighting preferences based on your retail obligations?

Turn 8:
Perfect! The 50/35/15 allocation ensures strong investment in your highest-potential markets while maintaining visibility across all major metros with Target and Whole Foods presence.

Now let's validate your budget allocation. With $3M total budget using this geographic weighting:

- **Tier 1:** $1.5M across 8-10 high-organic markets  
- **Tier 2:** $1.05M across secondary metros
- **Tier 3:** $450K for remaining national coverage

This projects to roughly $150K-190K per Tier 1 market, which provides substantial reach capacity for your awareness and trial goals.

Does this budget distribution feel realistic for achieving 15% aided awareness and 8-10% trial rates in your priority markets? And do you have flexibility to reallocate between tiers based on early performance data?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 9:
Excellent, that flexibility will be crucial for optimization. Now let's develop your value proposition messaging framework.

Given your dual objectives of awareness and trial, what's the core message that differentiates PureLife Organics snacks from established competitors? Are you leading with the organic certification, taste that kids actually love, convenience for busy families, or something else?

Understanding your primary value proposition helps ensure all channels deliver consistent messaging that drives both brand recognition and trial conversion.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Perfect positioning - "organic snacks your kids will love" directly addresses the category's biggest pain point. Leading with taste acceptance while the organic health benefit provides permission to purchase is smart strategy.

Your messaging framework should emphasize:
- **Primary hook:** Kids actually want to eat them (taste-first)
- **Permission:** Organic ingredients parents feel good about  
- **Proof:** Real family situations where kids choose your snacks
- **Convenience:** Fits seamlessly into busy family routines

Now we're ready for channel strategy. Based on your awareness and trial objectives, target audience, geography, and value proposition, I recommend a multi-channel approach that builds awareness first, then captures intent.

What's your experience with different media channels? Are there any you're particularly interested in or any you'd prefer to avoid?

Turn 12:
Excellent instinct! Increasing influencer to 15% and reducing programmatic display to 10% makes strategic sense for your objectives.

**Revised Channel Mix:**
- **Connected TV (30%):** $900K - Household awareness and reach
- **Paid Social (25%):** $750K - Instagram/Facebook engagement  
- **Paid Search (20%):** $600K - Intent capture
- **Influencer Marketing (15%):** $450K - Authentic family social proof
- **Programmatic Display (10%):** $300K - Retargeting and wellness placements

This shift prioritizes authentic social proof over traditional display, which aligns perfectly with your "kids actually love them" positioning. Real mom testimonials and kids genuinely enjoying your snacks will drive trial more effectively than banner ads.

The increased influencer budget allows for both macro-influencers for awareness and micro-influencers for authentic community engagement. This mix should deliver strong performance against both your 15% awareness and 8-10% trial targets.

Ready to move to measurement strategy?

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Excellent approach - let me recommend a channel mix optimized for your awareness-to-trial objectives with your health-conscious mom audience.

**Recommended Channel Mix:**
- **Connected TV (30%):** $900K - Premium brand building with household reach
- **Paid Social (25%):** $750K - Instagram/Facebook for engagement and targeting  
- **Paid Search (20%):** $600K - Capture organic snack intent and brand searches
- **Programmatic Display (15%):** $450K - Retargeting and wellness site placements
- **Influencer Marketing (10%):** $300K - Authentic family content from mom influencers

This prioritizes video storytelling for awareness while capturing intent through search and social. Connected TV builds broad household awareness, social drives engagement with your "kids actually love them" message, and search captures the demand you create.

Does this mix align with your comfort level? Any channels you'd want to adjust or explore differently?

Turn 14:
Perfect multi-source approach! Retailer data + promo codes + consumer panels will give you comprehensive trial tracking with strong validation across sources.

Now for testing strategy. Given your $3M budget and 6-month timeline, I recommend focusing on high-impact tests that can optimize performance quickly:

**Priority Tests:**
1. **Creative messaging test (Month 1-2):** "Kids love them" vs "Healthy + delicious" to validate your positioning
2. **Audience expansion test (Month 2-3):** Core health-conscious moms vs broader family purchasers
3. **Geographic performance test (Month 1-6):** Tier 1 vs Tier 2 market efficiency to optimize allocation

**Channel-Specific Tests:**
- Social: Video formats (lifestyle vs product-focused)
- Influencer: Macro vs micro-influencer performance
- Search: Brand defense vs category expansion keywords

Each test should run minimum 2-4 weeks for statistical significance. Which of these tests feels most critical for your launch success?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 13:
Exactly right - dual objectives require differentiated measurement. Here's your measurement framework:

**Primary KPIs by Objective:**

**Awareness (60% weight):**
- Aided brand awareness (target: 15% in 6 months)
- Share of voice in organic snack category
- Household reach in target demo

**Trial (40% weight):**
- First-time purchaser count (target: 160K-200K)
- Trial rate among target households (target: 8-10%)
- Cost per trial acquisition (target: $15-19)

**Channel-Specific Metrics:**
- CTV: Household reach, frequency, brand lift
- Social: Engagement rate, video completion, brand mention sentiment
- Search: Share of organic snack searches, branded search volume
- Influencer: Authentic engagement rate, promo code redemption
- Display: Retargeting conversion rate, wellness site performance

Given your category entry status, I'd recommend monthly brand tracking studies to monitor awareness progress. For trial measurement, are you planning to use retailer data, consumer panels, or promotional codes to track first-time purchases?
