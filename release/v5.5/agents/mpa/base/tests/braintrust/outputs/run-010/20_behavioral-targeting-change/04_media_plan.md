# Media Plan Output: Behavioral Targeting Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start - I can see you're targeting subscription growth with strong unit economics. Let me quickly check your efficiency target: $800K ÷ 50K = $16 per subscriber. With $420 LTV, that's a healthy 26x LTV/CAC ratio - very achievable for subscription nutrition.

To finalize your business outcome: Is your primary success metric the 50,000 new subscribers, or are you also tracking a specific revenue target from these acquisitions?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect! Your primary objective is clear: acquire 50,000 new subscribers with $800K budget, targeting $16 CAC against $420 LTV.

Now let's validate this efficiency target. At $16 CAC with $420 LTV, you're projecting a 26x return - that's extremely strong for subscription businesses. Most successful subscription nutrition brands operate between 3-5x LTV/CAC ratios.

This suggests either very conservative targeting or potential for much higher acquisition volume. A few quick questions to assess realism:

What's your current CAC from existing channels, and how does your $420 LTV break down - is that over 12 months, 24 months, or longer?

Turn 3:
Excellent context! Your current $25-30 CAC validates that $16 is achievable - you're already performing better than target. At scale, efficiency often compresses due to audience expansion, so planning conservatively makes sense.

But you're absolutely right about thinking bigger. If you can maintain even $25 CAC at scale, your $800K budget could acquire 32,000 subscribers at current efficiency, leaving $200K unused. Or you could target 32,000 subscribers and invest the remaining budget in retention or brand building.

Here's the key economics question: What's your contribution margin on the monthly subscription? This tells us your break-even point and how much efficiency compression you can absorb while scaling.

Turn 4:
Excellent - $24-25 monthly contribution means you break even in Month 1, which is outstanding unit economics for subscription businesses.

Let me model scenarios with your $800K budget:

**Conservative (your current target):** 50K subscribers at $16 CAC
**Moderate:** 32K subscribers at $25 CAC (current performance)  
**Aggressive:** 26K-27K subscribers at $30-31 CAC (allowing for scale compression)

Given your strong economics, I'd recommend targeting 30,000-35,000 subscribers. This allows CAC to rise to $23-27 as you expand audiences, while still beating your current $25-30 performance.

The key question: Would leadership prefer 50K subscribers with very conservative CAC assumptions, or fewer subscribers with more realistic efficiency targets that maximize budget utilization?

Turn 5:
Perfect decision! Let's set your target at 32,000 new subscribers with $800K budget, projecting $25 CAC. This fully deploys your budget with realistic efficiency expectations based on your current performance.

Your economics are now locked: 32K subscribers × $25 CAC = $800K budget, with $420 LTV creating a healthy 17x return and Month 1 break-even.

Now let's define your audience precisely. You mentioned fitness enthusiasts 25-55 across the US initially. For endurance nutrition specifically, we need to get much more targeted.

What specific endurance activities do your best subscribers participate in - running, cycling, triathlon, CrossFit, hiking - and do you see meaningful differences in LTV or retention across these segments?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 7:
Perfect! Your premium audience is highly engaged and research-driven. This gives us excellent targeting precision.

**Primary Audience Signals:**
- Event registration (marathons, Ironman, century rides)
- Fitness tracking app usage (Strava, Garmin, TrainingPeaks)
- Engagement with endurance sports influencers
- Active in training/nutrition discussion groups
- Research-oriented content consumption

**Behavioral Profile:** Goal-driven athletes training for specific events who value science-backed nutrition integrated into periodized training plans.

This audience is perfect for your higher CAC tolerance since they're quality-focused rather than price-sensitive.

Now for geography: You mentioned "across the US" initially. Given your premium audience, are there specific regions where endurance sports participation is higher - like Colorado, California, Pacific Northwest, Northeast corridor - or do you want true national coverage?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent insights! Marathon runners and Ironman athletes are premium segments with higher commitment levels - that explains the superior retention.

Let me prioritize your audience segments based on your feedback:

**Tier 1 (Primary):** Marathon runners, Ironman/triathlon athletes
**Tier 2 (Secondary):** Long-distance cyclists, ultra-runners  
**Tier 3 (Tertiary):** CrossFit athletes, general endurance athletes

For targeting precision, I need to understand the behavioral signals that identify these audiences. Do your best subscribers typically:
- Train for specific events (races, competitions)?
- Follow structured training programs?
- Use fitness tracking apps or devices?
- Engage with endurance sports content/communities?

What patterns do you see in how these premium subscribers discover and engage with endurance nutrition content?

Turn 8:
Excellent geographic strategy! Concentrating 70-80% in proven high-engagement markets maximizes efficiency while keeping 20-30% for strategic expansion testing.

**Primary Markets (70-80% budget):**
- Colorado (Boulder/Denver corridor)
- California (Bay Area, LA, San Diego)
- Pacific Northwest (Seattle/Portland)
- Northeast (Boston, NYC, DC metro)

**Test Markets (20-30% budget):**
- Austin, Atlanta, Chicago

This geographic focus aligns perfectly with your premium audience - these markets have both high endurance sports participation and the income levels to support $39/month subscriptions.

Now let's validate your budget allocation. With $800K total budget targeting 32K subscribers:

**Primary markets:** $560K-640K (22K-26K subscribers)
**Test markets:** $160K-240K (6K-10K subscribers)

Does this split feel right, or would you prefer a different primary/test ratio?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Perfect! Your allocation is locked: $600K primary markets (24K subscribers) and $200K test markets (8K subscribers) = 32K total subscribers.

Now let's develop your value proposition. You have a sophisticated, research-driven audience training for specific events. They want science-backed nutrition that integrates with their periodized training.

Based on your audience insights, your value proposition should likely emphasize:
- Scientific formulation/research backing
- Event-specific nutrition timing
- Integration with training periodization
- Performance outcomes vs. general health

What's your current core value proposition, and how do you differentiate from competitors like GU, Hammer Nutrition, or Tailwind in this crowded endurance nutrition space?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Excellent differentiation! Your periodized nutrition system is genuinely unique - competitors sell products, you sell intelligent fueling that adapts to training cycles. This is perfect for your research-driven audience.

**Your Core Value Proposition:**
"The only nutrition system that periodizes with your training - delivering the right formulation at the right training phase, automatically."

**Key Message Pillars:**
- Periodized delivery (not just race day products)
- Training calendar integration 
- Science-backed timing protocols
- Automated adaptation to training phases

You're right that sharpening this message is crucial. Your audience understands periodization from training - extending that concept to nutrition is brilliant positioning.

For messaging refinement: When your best customers describe EnduraFuel to other athletes, what specific benefits do they emphasize - the convenience, the performance gains, or the intelligent adaptation to their training?
