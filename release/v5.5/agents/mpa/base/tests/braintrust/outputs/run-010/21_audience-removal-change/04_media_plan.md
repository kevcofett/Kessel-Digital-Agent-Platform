# Media Plan Output: Audience Removal Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've given me excellent detail to start. Let me calculate your implied efficiency: $4M ÷ 15,000 = $267 per test drive. This is aggressive for automotive but achievable with precise targeting.

Your business outcome is clear - drive test drives for your EV launch. But I need to understand how you'll measure true success beyond the test drives themselves. What's your primary KPI for determining if this campaign succeeded? For example, are you tracking conversion from test drive to purchase, brand awareness lift, or something else?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect! So your primary KPI is 15,000 test drives, with an ultimate target of ~2,000 vehicle sales at 12-15% conversion. That's solid conversion modeling for automotive.

Let me assess the economics: $4M ÷ 2,000 sales = $2,000 cost per sale. For EVs in the $40K+ range, this efficiency is achievable but requires disciplined execution.

Your $267 per test drive target is ambitious for automotive - industry benchmarks typically show $300-500 per test drive depending on vehicle price point. To hit your target, we'll need precise audience definition and efficient channel selection.

One key question on your unit economics: What's the approximate vehicle price point? This helps me validate whether $2,000 acquisition cost maintains healthy margins and whether your efficiency targets align with the value you're delivering.

Turn 3:
Excellent - $55K ASP with $5,500 margin and 3:1 ratio shows strong unit economics. Your finance team is right to be comfortable with that structure.

Your aggressive $267 test drive target makes more sense now given the high-value outcome. Based on premium EV benchmarks, you're targeting the efficient end of the range, which is achievable with your three well-defined segments and tier-1 markets.

The flexibility you mentioned is smart - quality over quantity will be crucial. Better to hit 12,000 high-intent test drives that convert at 15% than 15,000 that convert at 8%.

Now let's move to Step 3: Audience. You've outlined three segments: eco-conscious early adopters 25-45, luxury buyers 45-65 switching from German sedans, and tech enthusiasts focused on features.

Which of these three segments do you expect to be your highest-volume opportunity? Understanding the primary versus secondary segments helps us allocate budget and prioritize targeting precision.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 4:
Perfect insight. Luxury switchers as your primary volume driver makes strategic sense - they have established purchase intent and budget, just need category conversion. That's typically more efficient than creating demand from scratch.

Your read on segment dynamics is spot-on: eco-conscious converts easily but limited scale, tech enthusiasts engage highly but price-sensitive, luxury switchers offer volume with existing purchase power.

This suggests budget weighting toward luxury switchers while maintaining presence with the other segments for brand building and long-term pipeline.

Quick clarification on the luxury segment: When you say "switching from German sedans," are you targeting people currently driving BMW/Audi/Mercedes who are ready to replace, or are you going broader to include consideration-stage luxury buyers who might typically choose German brands? This affects how we identify and reach them.

Turn 5:
Excellent targeting strategy. Current German sedan owners in replacement cycle is a precise, high-intent audience with clear behavioral triggers. Much more efficient than broad luxury consideration.

Your 3-5 year ownership cycle targeting is smart - that's when owners are most receptive to category switching and have established replacement timelines.

Now for geography: You mentioned California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Washington. Given your luxury switcher focus, I need to understand the strategic thinking behind these markets.

Are you prioritizing these five states because they have the highest concentrations of your target German sedan owners, because of EV infrastructure readiness, or because of regulatory/incentive environments? Understanding the selection criteria helps us weight budget allocation across markets.

Turn 6:
Smart market selection - you're balancing infrastructure readiness with competitive opportunity. Texas as an emerging market with high target density but lower EV competition is particularly strategic.

Your proposed allocation makes sense: California at 35-40% leverages infrastructure and incentives, while Texas at 15-20% capitalizes on the competitive gap. The other markets fall naturally in between.

Let me validate this against your budget: 40% to California = $1.6M, which projects to ~6,000 test drives at your target efficiency. Given California's EV-ready infrastructure, this seems achievable.

One consideration: Texas's developing infrastructure might require slightly higher cost per test drive since you're doing more category education. Are you comfortable potentially running $300-350 per test drive in Texas versus your $267 blended target, offset by potentially more efficient performance in California and Washington?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Perfect - that geographic variance approach is exactly right. Texas as a long-term investment play while leveraging efficiency in mature EV markets creates a balanced portfolio.

Your blended $267 target with Texas at $300-350 means California and Washington need to perform around $220-240 per test drive to offset. Given their EV infrastructure and audience readiness, that's achievable.

Now let's move to Step 5: Budget allocation. You've outlined geographic splits, but within each market, how are you thinking about allocating budget across your three audience segments? 

Should we weight toward luxury switchers as your primary volume driver, or do you want more balanced investment across all three segments for broader market development?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
Excellent allocation - 60% luxury switchers, 25% eco-conscious, 15% tech enthusiasts aligns perfectly with your volume and conversion analysis.

Let me model this: 60% = $2.4M targeting luxury switchers, projecting ~9,000 test drives. 25% = $1M for eco-conscious, projecting ~3,750 drives. 15% = $600K for tech enthusiasts, projecting ~2,250 drives. That totals your 15,000 target.

This weighting maximizes your primary conversion engine while maintaining presence across all segments for brand building. The eco-conscious segment getting 25% despite smaller volume makes sense given their easier conversion - likely your most efficient segment.

Now let's move to Step 6: Value Proposition. You'll need distinct messaging for each segment to drive those test drives. For your primary luxury switcher audience, what's the core value proposition that will convince a current BMW/Audi/Mercedes owner to test drive an EV instead of staying with their familiar German brand?
