# Media Plan Output: Audience Addition Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've provided excellent detail upfront. Let me quickly model your economics: $2M / 5,000 leads = $400 cost per lead. With $15K LTV, that projects to a 37.5x return ratio, which is very healthy for wealth management.

Before we dive deeper into economics, I want to confirm your primary objective. When you say "qualified leads," what specific business outcome defines success - is it leads that book consultations, leads that become clients, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect! So your primary objective is 5,000 booked consultations, with the ultimate goal of 1,000 new clients. That's a clear success definition.

Now let me refine the economics. At 20% consultation-to-client conversion:
- 5,000 consultations → 1,000 clients
- 1,000 clients × $15K LTV = $15M total value
- $2M investment / $15M return = 7.5x ROI

Your $400 cost per consultation is aggressive but achievable for HNW targeting. Wealth management typically sees $300-600 per qualified lead based on market benchmarks.

One key question for Step 2: Do you have data on what percentage of your booked consultations actually show up? No-show rates can significantly impact the true cost per engaged prospect, and this affects our channel strategy.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 3:
Excellent - 85% show rate is strong for wealth management. That gives us solid economics:

$2M / 4,250 attended consultations = $470 per engaged prospect
4,250 attended × 20% conversion = 850 actual clients (slightly below your 1,000 target)

This reveals an important gap. To hit 1,000 clients, you'd need either:
- 5,880 booked consultations (17% more leads), or
- Improve conversion rate to 24%

The $470 cost per engaged prospect is at the high end but defensible for HNW markets. Your confidence in advisor conversion is key - that's where the real value creation happens.

Your economics look viable with this adjustment. Ready to move to Step 3 and define your audience precisely? The more targeted we get with that $1M+ investable assets criteria, the better our channel efficiency will be.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 4:
Perfect - targeting 5,880 booked consultations accounts for the show-up rate and gets you to your 1,000 client goal.

$2M / 5,880 = $340 per booked consultation, which is much more achievable for HNW targeting.

Now for Step 3 - Audience. You've defined the foundation well: 55+ with $1M+ investable assets. Let me help you get more precise for targeting efficiency.

Beyond age and assets, what behavioral or life-stage signals indicate someone is actively seeking wealth management services? For example, are they typically recent retirees, people who've had a liquidity event, or those approaching a specific age milestone like 62 or 65?

Turn 5:
Excellent insights. Those life-stage triggers are gold for targeting precision. Let me capture the key audience signals:

**Primary segments:**
- Ages 60-67 (capturing pre/post retirement transition)
- Recent retirees (0-2 years out)
- Social Security decision window (62+)
- Medicare transition (65+)

**Behavioral indicators:**
- Interest in tax-efficient strategies
- Wealth preservation focus vs. growth
- Comprehensive planning needs

**Harder-to-target segments:**
- Liquidity event recipients (business sales, inheritance)

Two targeting questions: First, do you see geographic clustering within your top 30 wealth markets - are certain metros more responsive than others? Second, are there income proxies we can use beyond the $1M investable assets, like household income thresholds or property values, since direct asset targeting is limited on most platforms?

Turn 6:
Perfect targeting intelligence. You've identified strong geographic prioritization and smart proxy signals:

**High-performing markets:** Northeast (Boston, NYC, CT), West Coast (SF, Seattle)
**Growing markets:** Dallas, Atlanta, Denver
**Income proxy:** $250K+ household (with retiree income caveat noted)
**Property proxy:** $800K+ median home value zip codes
**Content engagement:** Estate planning, tax strategy, retirement income (vs. general investment)

This gives us excellent targeting precision. One final audience question: Do you have any first-party data we can leverage - existing client lists for lookalikes, website visitors, or email subscribers? First-party audiences typically outperform cold prospecting by 40-60% in wealth management.

Once we have that, we'll move to Step 4 to prioritize your geographic allocation across those 30 markets.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 7:
Excellent first-party assets! That's a strong foundation:

**Current clients (12,000):** Premium lookalike source - these converted at your price point
**Email subscribers (25,000):** High-intent audience from content downloads
**Website traffic (8-10K monthly):** Retargeting pool for nurture sequences

Your email list growth strategy is smart - content-driven acquisition builds qualified audiences. Those retirement and tax planning downloads are perfect intent signals.

Your audience definition is now complete and highly targetable. Ready for Step 4 - Geography?

You mentioned 30 wealth markets with clear performance tiers. Should we prioritize budget allocation toward your proven high-performers (Northeast, West Coast) or balance across all 30 markets? This decision impacts both efficiency and growth potential.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Smart allocation strategy. Let me model that geographic split:

**Tier 1 markets (60% = $1.2M):** Northeast + West Coast proven performers
**Tier 2 markets (40% = $800K):** Dallas, Atlanta, Denver expansion markets

At $340 per consultation target:
- Tier 1: 3,530 consultations from proven markets
- Tier 2: 2,350 consultations from growth markets

This balances efficiency with expansion perfectly. The 60/40 split lets you bank on known performance while testing scalability.

Your geography strategy is locked. Ready for Step 5 - Budget allocation by audience segments and any geographic refinements? We'll want to determine how much to allocate between your first-party audiences (lookalikes, retargeting) versus cold prospecting within each geographic tier.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Excellent prioritization. Let me model that audience allocation:

**First-party focus (70% = $1.4M):**
- Client lookalikes: ~$900K (highest priority - proven converters)
- Email subscriber lookalikes: ~$300K 
- Website retargeting: ~$200K

**Cold prospecting (30% = $600K):**
- Cold audiences with your targeting criteria

This heavily weights your highest-intent audiences. Client lookalikes should deliver your most efficient $340 CPL, while cold prospecting captures incremental reach.

Applied across geography:
- Tier 1 markets: $840K first-party + $360K cold
- Tier 2 markets: $560K first-party + $240K cold

Your budget allocation is strategically sound. Ready for Step 6 - Value Proposition? What's your core message that differentiates WealthPath from other wealth managers when targeting these high-net-worth prospects?

Turn 10:
Perfect differentiation - "Wealth Preservation Through Smart Distribution" directly addresses your audience's core concern. That's much more compelling than generic "wealth management" for 55+ prospects.

Your value prop hits their pain points precisely:
- **Social Security optimization** (relevant at 62+)
- **Roth conversion strategies** (tax planning focus)
- **Multi-account coordination** (sophisticated vs. basic 401k advice)
- **Distribution phase expertise** (preservation over growth)

This messaging should resonate strongly with your behavioral targeting around estate planning and tax strategy content.

Your value proposition is clear and differentiated. Ready for Step 7 - Channels? Given your audience (55+ HNW), geography (30 wealth markets), and sophisticated value prop, which channels do you think would be most effective for reaching these prospects?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Excellent channel thinking! You've identified the right mix for HNW targeting. Let me recommend allocation based on your $340 CPL target:

**Primary channels (75% = $1.5M):**
- **LinkedIn (40% = $800K):** Premium for HNW professionals, excellent income/asset targeting
- **Google Search (35% = $700K):** High-intent keywords you mentioned capture active researchers

**Secondary channels (25% = $500K):**
- **Facebook/Meta (15% = $300K):** Strong for 55+ retargeting and lookalikes
- **Programmatic display (10% = $200K):** Financial publication targeting (WSJ, Barron's)

LinkedIn and Google Search should deliver closest to your $340 CPL target. Meta provides scale for your first-party audiences. Programmatic on financial sites adds credible reach.

Skip traditional radio/print - you're right that precision targeting is essential at your efficiency target.

Ready for Step 8 - Measurement? How will you track consultations booked across these channels, and do you have attribution setup to see the full customer journey?

Turn 13:
Excellent testing priorities! You're focusing on high-impact levers. Let me structure this into a systematic approach:

**Month 1-2 Testing (Foundation):**
- **Messaging:** "Wealth Preservation Through Smart Distribution" vs "Keep More of Your Retirement Income" 
- **Audience:** Client lookalike segments (recent retirees vs business owners vs high earners)

**Month 3-4 Testing (Optimization):**
- **Creative formats:** Client video testimonials vs educational Social Security content
- **Landing pages:** Consultation booking flow variations

**Month 5-6 Testing (Scale):**
- **Geographic:** Test budget reallocation between Tier 1/Tier 2 markets
- **Channel mix:** Optimize LinkedIn/Google Search allocation based on performance

**Testing discipline:** Run one primary test per channel at a time, 2-week minimum windows given your longer consideration cycles. Track both immediate bookings and 30-day attributed conversions.

Ready for Step 10 - Risk assessment? What could derail this plan, and how do we build safeguards to protect your $340 CPL target and 5,880 consultation goal?

Turn 14:
Excellent risk identification! Those are the exact failure modes that derail HNW campaigns. Let me structure mitigation strategies:

**CPL Inflation Protection:**
- Reserve 15% budget ($300K) as contingency for cost spikes
- Set automated bid caps at $450 CPL (25% buffer above $340 target)
- Weekly performance reviews with reallocation triggers

**Market Volatility Mitigation:**
- Emphasize "wealth preservation" messaging during market downturns
- Shift budget toward lower-funnel audiences (retargeting) when sentiment drops
- Prepare "protection-focused" creative variants

**Show-Rate Protection:**
- Target 6,200 bookings (5% buffer above 5,880) to account for potential decline
- Implement confirmation sequences and calendar integration
- Track show-rates weekly by channel - some may perform better

**Capacity Management:**
- Phase launch over 8-10 weeks vs immediate full spend
- Monitor consultation quality scores and conversion rates
- Build advisor onboarding pipeline ahead of volume increase

**Contingency Triggers:**
- If CPL exceeds $400 for 2 weeks: Pause lowest-performing 20% of spend
- If show-rate drops below 80%: Increase booking buffer to 6,500

Your media plan is complete and defensible. You have clear objectives, realistic economics, precise targeting, smart channel allocation, and comprehensive risk management. Ready to execute?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 12:
Good foundation with CRM lead tracking and UTM parameters. You're right that wealth management involves long consideration cycles - prospects often research for months before booking.

**Current setup strengths:**
- CRM lead source tracking
- UTM campaign tracking  
- Google Analytics conversion tracking

**Critical gap:** Cross-channel attribution for multi-touch journeys

**Recommendations:**
1. **First-party tracking:** Implement lead forms that ask "How did you first hear about us?" to capture awareness drivers
2. **View-through windows:** Extend attribution windows to 30-60 days given long consideration cycles
3. **Content engagement scoring:** Track whitepaper downloads, page visits before conversion
4. **Phone call tracking:** Use dynamic numbers by channel since many HNW prospects prefer calling

**Primary KPI recommendation:** Cost per booked consultation with 7-day click, 30-day view attribution. Wealth management needs longer windows than typical lead gen.

Ready for Step 9 - Testing strategy? What elements do you want to test systematically to optimize toward that $340 CPL target?
