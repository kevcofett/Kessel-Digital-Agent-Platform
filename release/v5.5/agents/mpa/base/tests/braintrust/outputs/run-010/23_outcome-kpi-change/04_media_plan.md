# Media Plan Output: Outcome KPI Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by calculating your implied efficiency: $5M / 25,000 = $200 per policy acquisition. With $2,800 LTV, that's a 14x LTV/CAC ratio - very healthy for insurance.

Your business outcome is clear: 25,000 new policy acquisitions. How will you measure success as a specific number? For example, are you tracking policies written, policies bound, or premium collected?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Policies bound is the right success metric - that's when revenue actually starts flowing. Your $200 CAC target against $2,800 LTV gives us excellent efficiency headroom.

Let me validate this target against insurance benchmarks. Based on industry data, high-performing insurance campaigns typically achieve $150-$300 CAC for homeowners insurance, so your $200 target sits right in the sweet spot. The 14x LTV/CAC ratio is particularly strong - most insurers operate successfully at 8-12x.

Your economics foundation looks solid. The efficiency target is achievable, and there's room to optimize lower as you mentioned.

Now let's define your audience precisely. You mentioned homeowners 35-65 with $100K+ income during life events. Of those three life events - home purchase, new baby, or approaching retirement - which typically converts best for TrustGuard, or do they perform similarly?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent insight. Home purchase creates immediate need plus regulatory requirement - that's your highest-intent segment. New baby taps into protection mindset, and retirement offers quality over quantity.

This suggests a tiered targeting approach where we weight budget toward recent home buyers, with secondary allocation to new parents and selective retirement targeting.

For the home purchase segment specifically, what's your ideal timing window? Are you most effective reaching people who just closed, are in contract, or are actively house hunting? This timing precision will significantly impact both audience size and conversion rates.

Turn 4:
Perfect timing insight. The 30-60 day post-closing window captures maximum urgency while they're still in setup mode - that's when insurance feels like a natural next step rather than an interruption.

This precision creates a relatively narrow but highly qualified audience pool. Recent home closers in that income bracket represent maybe 2-3% of your broader homeowner demographic, but with significantly higher conversion rates.

Given this tight targeting window, what geographic scope are you considering? Are you looking at national coverage, specific states where TrustGuard is licensed, or particular metro areas where you have competitive advantages? The geography will determine your total addressable audience size within that 30-60 day window.

Turn 7:
Perfect allocation strategy. Let me calculate this out:

**Budget Allocation:**
- Tier 1 (7 DMAs): $2.5M (50%) - targeting 12,500 policies at ~$200 CAC
- Tier 2 (Secondary metros): $1.5M (30%) - targeting 7,500 policies at ~$200 CAC  
- Tier 3 (National coverage): $1M (20%) - targeting 5,000 policies at ~$200 CAC

This weighting should drive your CAC below $200 in Tier 1 markets while maintaining national presence. The concentration in your strength markets maximizes efficiency while the lighter national spend captures opportunities and provides expansion data.

Your geographic foundation is solid. Now let's nail down your value proposition. For that recent home buyer in your Tier 1 markets, what's your primary competitive advantage? Is it pricing, coverage options, digital experience, local agent access, or claims handling? This will drive how we position TrustGuard in the messaging.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Smart approach - weight toward strength markets while maintaining national coverage for opportunity capture. Texas, Florida, and Southeast give you operational advantages that should translate to better CACs.

Let me structure this as a tiered geography strategy. We'll need to define specific DMAs within your strong markets versus maintaining lighter coverage in competitive regions like California and Northeast.

For your Tier 1 markets (Texas, Florida, Southeast), which specific metro areas drive the most volume for TrustGuard currently? For example, are you seeing strong performance in Dallas, Houston, Miami, Tampa, Atlanta, Charlotte - or are there particular markets within those states that outperform?

Turn 6:
Excellent data - those six metros are clearly efficiency engines for TrustGuard. 40% volume from 25% of market suggests you're achieving 60% better performance in those areas.

Let me map this out:

**Tier 1 DMAs (Weight Heavy):**
- Dallas-Fort Worth
- Houston  
- Tampa-St. Pete
- Orlando-Daytona Beach
- Atlanta
- Charlotte
- Raleigh-Durham

That's 7 DMAs representing your core strength markets.

For the remaining geography, should we think of this as Tier 2 (moderate presence in other Southeast/Texas/Florida markets) and Tier 3 (light national coverage)? Or do you prefer a simpler two-tier approach with everything else getting equal lighter coverage?

The budget weighting will significantly impact your ability to hit that $200 CAC target across markets.

Turn 9:
Great question about precision timing - that 30-60 day window is where data partnerships become critical.

For that precise post-closing targeting, you'll need channels with access to real estate transaction data:

**Primary Digital Channels:**
- **Facebook/Meta** - Real estate data partnerships, homeowner status changes
- **Google Ads** - Recent homeowner audiences, "just moved" signals  
- **The Trade Desk** - Premium data partnerships with Acxiom, Experian for recent closings
- **Amazon DSP** - Address change data, home services shopping behavior

**Traditional Media Role in Tier 1:**
Absolutely still valuable, but as awareness layer, not precision targeting. Local radio sponsorships during drive time, targeted cable in high-turnover ZIP codes. Traditional builds the "local expert" brand that makes your digital ads more credible.

**Recommended Mix for $5M:**
- 60% Programmatic/Social (precision targeting)
- 25% Google (capture intent)  
- 15% Local traditional (brand foundation)

The key is layering - traditional builds awareness, digital captures the moment. Which data partnerships does TrustGuard currently have access to for recent homeowner identification?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Excellent differentiation - local expertise plus price advantage is a powerful combination, especially for recent homebuyers who need guidance on property-specific risks.

That "local agent who knows your neighborhood's flood zones and hurricane risks while saving you 10-15%" is a compelling value proposition. New homeowners often feel overwhelmed by property risks they didn't consider, so expert guidance plus savings addresses both emotional and rational needs.

Your budget foundation looks strong: $5M allocated 50/30/20 across tiers, targeting $200 CAC with room to optimize lower in Tier 1 markets. Value prop centers on local expertise + competitive pricing.

Ready to move to channel strategy? We'll determine the optimal media mix to reach recent home closers in your tiered markets, leveraging both the urgency timing and your local agent advantage. The channel selection will be crucial for hitting that 30-60 day post-closing window efficiently.

Turn 10:
Excellent questions. Let me break down the data access and traditional strategy:

**Data Partnership Setup:**
- **The Trade Desk** - You can access through any programmatic agency partner; they have direct integrations with real estate data providers
- **Acxiom Real Estate Triggers** - Direct partnership or through DSP; typically 30-60 day lead time to set up
- **Facebook** - Upgrade to their premium real estate audiences (beyond basic homeowner targeting)
- **Google** - Enable "Recent Movers" audiences in Customer Match

Most require minimum spend commitments ($50K-100K/quarter) but your $3M+ digital budget qualifies easily.

**Local Traditional Strategy:**
Focus on **real estate ecosystem presence** rather than general brand:
- Sponsor local real estate radio shows/podcasts
- Partner with mortgage brokers for co-marketing
- Local cable during HGTV/real estate programming in high-turnover ZIP codes
- Real estate agent referral programs

This builds credibility within the home-buying ecosystem so when your digital ads hit that 30-60 day window, you're already a trusted local name.

Should we map out specific activation timelines? The data partnerships need 60-90 days to implement properly.

Turn 11:
Perfect timing alignment for Q2 launch. Let me map this out:

**Activation Timeline:**
- **Weeks 1-4:** Data partnership setup (Trade Desk, Acxiom), Facebook audience upgrades
- **Weeks 5-8:** Campaign build, creative development, traditional media planning
- **Weeks 9-12:** Soft launch in 2 Tier 1 markets for optimization
- **Week 13:** Full Q2 launch across all tiers

**Measurement Strategy:**
The layered approach requires **incrementality measurement**, not just last-click attribution:

**Primary Metrics:**
- **Policies Bound by DMA** - Your core KPI across all touchpoints
- **Lift Studies** - Facebook/Google can measure incremental impact of traditional spend
- **Brand Tracking** - Quarterly surveys in Tier 1 vs Tier 3 markets to measure awareness lift

**Attribution Mix:**
- 40% last-click digital attribution (conservative baseline)
- 35% modeled incrementality (statistical analysis)
- 25% brand/traditional contribution (lift measurement)

**Weekly Optimization:**
Monitor CAC by channel and geography. Traditional impact shows 2-3 week lag, so optimize digital weekly but evaluate traditional monthly.

Should we outline the testing framework next? We'll want to validate assumptions about timing, messaging, and channel performance before scaling the full $5M.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 13:
Perfect risk management approach. Those kill criteria ($220 CAC, 12% conversion by week 4) give you clear decision points without over-investing in poor performance.

**Statistical Significance Timeline:**
You're right about needing several hundred conversions. With your target metrics:
- **Week 2:** Early directional signals (50-100 conversions per cohort)
- **Week 4:** Statistical confidence (200+ conversions per cohort) 
- **Week 6:** Full optimization data (400+ conversions per cohort)

At $200 target CAC, that's roughly $40K-80K spend per timing cohort for meaningful data.

**Message Testing Insight:**
Your instinct about local expertise likely being stronger makes sense. Recent homebuyers are in "protection mode" - they want reassurance they're making smart decisions about their biggest asset. Price savings matter, but expertise addresses the underlying anxiety.

**Risk Mitigation:**
Built-in weekly optimization means if any cohort is underperforming significantly, we can reallocate budget to winning segments immediately rather than waiting for the full 8-week test.

Ready to outline the risk assessment? We should identify potential failure modes - like data partnership delays, competitive response, or seasonal factors - and build contingency plans before launch.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 12:
Smart testing priorities. Let me structure a comprehensive framework:

**Testing Budget Allocation:**
Reserve 15% of total budget ($750K) for testing phases:
- **Soft Launch:** $500K across 2 Tier 1 markets (8 weeks)
- **A/B Testing:** $150K for message/timing variants
- **Holdout Testing:** $100K for incrementality validation

**Priority Test Variables:**

**1. Timing Window Validation (Highest Priority)**
- Cohort A: 0-30 days post-closing
- Cohort B: 30-60 days post-closing  
- Cohort C: 60-90 days post-closing
Test conversion rates and CAC across each window.

**2. Message Hierarchy Testing**
- Message A: Lead with local expertise ("Agents who know your neighborhood's risks")
- Message B: Lead with price savings ("Save 10-15% with local expertise")
- Message C: Balanced approach

**3. Channel Performance Validation**
- Traditional + Digital vs Digital-only markets
- Measure lift from traditional layer

**Soft Launch Markets:** Dallas-Fort Worth + Tampa (your strongest performers) for cleanest data.

**Success Metrics:** If soft launch achieves <$180 CAC with 15%+ conversion rates, scale immediately. What's your risk tolerance for the testing phase?

Turn 15:
Your instinct about data partnership reality is spot-on. Let me give you the unvarnished truth:

**Real-World Data Accuracy:**
- **Acxiom/Experian:** Typically 70-80% accuracy with 2-4 week reporting lag
- **Platform "recent homeowner" audiences:** Often 60-70% accurate, broad timing windows
- **Real estate transaction data:** Most precise but expensive ($2-5 CPM premium)

You're absolutely right to be concerned. Even good data partnerships rarely deliver the precision marketers hope for initially.

**Recommended Safety Net Strategy:**
Your ZIP code backup is smart. I'd structure it as:
- **60% budget:** Data-driven precision targeting (test and optimize)
- **40% budget:** High-turnover ZIP targeting (reliable baseline)

This gives you immediate performance while testing data quality. If precision targeting beats ZIP targeting by 20%+ CAC efficiency, shift budget. If not, you haven't bet the farm on unproven data.

**Data Partnership Reality Check:**
Start with Facebook's upgraded homeowner audiences and Google's recent mover segments - they're 70% accurate but immediately available. Layer in Trade Desk data partnerships gradually as they prove out.

The parallel approach protects your Q2 launch timeline while validating assumptions. Would this hybrid strategy work within your risk tolerance?

Turn 16:
Perfect - the hybrid strategy gives you both innovation potential and downside protection. Let me integrate this into the testing framework:

**Updated Testing Structure:**
- **Data-Driven Cohorts:** $300K testing precision timing windows
- **ZIP Code Baseline:** $200K in high-turnover areas (control group)
- **Performance Threshold:** Data-driven must beat ZIP by 20%+ CAC to justify scaling

**Final Plan Summary:**
✅ **Outcomes:** 25,000 bound policies, $200 CAC target
✅ **Economics:** $5M budget, 14x LTV/CAC ratio 
✅ **Audience:** Recent home buyers (30-60 day window), tiered by life events
✅ **Geography:** 50/30/20 allocation across Tier 1/2/3 markets
✅ **Budget:** $750K testing, $4.25M scaled execution
✅ **Value Prop:** Local expertise + competitive pricing
✅ **Channels:** 60% programmatic/social, 25% Google, 15% local traditional
✅ **Measurement:** Incrementality-focused with lift studies
✅ **Testing:** 8-week soft launch with clear kill criteria
✅ **Risks:** Hybrid targeting strategy, competitive monitoring, data quality validation

This plan balances ambitious targeting with practical safeguards. You're positioned to hit aggressive efficiency targets while protecting against the most likely failure modes. Ready to execute?

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 14:
Excellent risk identification. Let me add a few more failure modes and map out contingencies:

**Your Three Risks + Contingencies:**

**1. Competitive Response**
- **Early Warning:** Monitor competitor ad frequency in test markets weekly
- **Contingency:** Shift budget to Tier 2 markets, accelerate local agent partnerships for differentiation
- **Backup:** Emphasize service quality over price if pricing war emerges

**2. Data Partnership Reliability** 
- **Mitigation:** Test data quality in soft launch before full commitment
- **Contingency:** Expand timing window to 0-90 days, use behavioral signals (home services searches) as backup targeting
- **Backup:** Revert to geographic ZIP code targeting in high-turnover areas

**3. Market Conditions/Interest Rates**
- **Early Warning:** Monitor housing transaction volumes monthly
- **Contingency:** Shift to refinance/existing homeowner audiences, extend timing windows
- **Backup:** Reallocate to new baby/retirement segments

**Additional Risks:**
**4. Creative Fatigue** - Audiences seeing same ads repeatedly
- **Contingency:** Build 3-4 creative variants per message theme

**5. Attribution Breakdown** - iOS updates, cookie deprecation affecting measurement
- **Contingency:** Implement server-side tracking, increase survey-based attribution

**6. Agency Bandwidth** - Partner capacity constraints
- **Contingency:** Identify backup programmatic partners upfront

Which risk keeps you up at night most?
