# Media Plan Output: Basic User - Steps 1-2 Completion

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve - are you looking to increase total sales, acquire new customers, or grow revenue?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Growing revenue through more shoe sales online is a clear objective. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success.

What's your revenue target - how much in total shoe sales are you aiming for from this effort?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it! So you want to generate $500,000 in shoe sales from a $250,000 marketing budget. Let me show you what that means:

$250,000 budget to generate $500,000 in sales = 2x return on your marketing spend

That's a solid target for online retail. Now I need to understand your customer economics to see if this is achievable.

What's your average order value - how much does a typical customer spend when they buy shoes from you?

Turn 4:
Perfect! At $100 average order value, your $500,000 sales target means you need 5,000 new customers.

$500,000 sales target ÷ $100 per order = 5,000 customers needed

Now let's check if your budget works: $250,000 ÷ 5,000 customers = $50 per customer

This means you can spend up to $50 to acquire each new customer. For online shoe retailers, this is typically achievable - most see costs between $40-70 per customer.

To make sure this works for your business: what profit do you make on a typical $100 shoe order after covering the cost of the shoes and shipping?
