USER:
Hey, I'm the growth lead at QuickSend. We're a remittance fintech looking to acquire 10,000 new users this quarter with a $500K media spend. Let's build out the media strategy.

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with a quick calculation: $500K / 10,000 users = $50 per user acquisition. For remittance fintech, this looks achievable based on typical benchmarks of $40-70 per user.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 10,000 new users - is it transaction volume, revenue growth, or market expansion?

USER:
That $50 cost per acquisition sounds reasonable based on what I've seen in competitive analysis. Our primary goal is revenue growth - we want to scale our user base to hit our quarterly revenue targets. We're also looking at market expansion since we've been pretty focused on our core corridors so far, but the main driver is definitely growing transaction volume through new user acquisition.

AGENT:
Perfect! So your objective is revenue growth through scaling transaction volume via 10,000 new users at $50 per acquisition.

Now I need to define how we'll measure success. For remittance, this could be total transaction volume, revenue generated, or users completing their first transaction within a timeframe.

What's your primary success metric - and do you have a specific target number we're aiming to hit this quarter?

TURN 3 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're primarily tracking total transaction volume as our key success metric. I'd say we want to hit around $15-20 million in transaction volume from these new users this quarter, though I honestly don't have complete visibility into our conversion rates from signup to first transaction. We should probably also track users completing their first transaction within 30 days since that's a strong indicator they'll become regular users.

AGENT:
Excellent! So we're targeting $15-20M in transaction volume from 10,000 new users = $1,500-2,000 average volume per user this quarter.

Let me model the economics quickly. Assuming a 2.5% take rate (typical for remittance), that projects to:
- $15M volume × 2.5% = $375K revenue (low end)
- $20M volume × 2.5% = $500K revenue (high end)

$500K media spend to generate $375-500K revenue means you're essentially breaking even in quarter 1, which is aggressive but achievable if users continue transacting.

Quick reality check - does that 2.5% take rate assumption sound right for your business model, and are you comfortable with near break-even economics in the first quarter?

TURN 4 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
That 2.5% take rate is pretty close - we're actually closer to 3% on average across our corridors, so the revenue projections would be a bit higher. I'm definitely comfortable with near break-even in the first quarter since our focus is on building the user base for long-term value. The way I see it, if we can acquire quality users who stick around and transact regularly, the lifetime value will justify the upfront investment, even if I don't have the exact LTV numbers at my fingertips right now.

AGENT:
Perfect! At 3% take rate, you're looking at:
- $15M volume × 3% = $450K revenue (low end)  
- $20M volume × 3% = $600K revenue (high end)

So $500K spend generating $450-600K revenue gives you 10-20% positive return in Q1 alone, which is solid for user acquisition.

Your $50 per user target is realistic for remittance. Industry benchmarks typically run $40-70, and your approach of prioritizing user base growth for long-term value makes sense given remittance users tend to have strong repeat behavior.

Step 2 complete - your economics are achievable. Now let's define your target audience. 

Who is your ideal new user? Are you targeting specific demographics, income levels, or people sending to particular countries?
