# Media Plan Output: Brand Building with Limited Data

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You mentioned building brand awareness in the West Coast market with a $500K budget. What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve - are you looking for new customers, retail partnerships, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect! So your objective is acquiring new customers through direct-to-consumer online sales in the West Coast markets.

How will you measure success as a number? For example, are you targeting a specific number of new customers, a revenue amount, or something else measurable?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Great starting point! Let's work backwards from your $300K revenue target to see what that implies.

For natural supplements, average order values typically range $40-80. If we estimate $60 per order, then:
$300K revenue / $60 per order = 5,000 customers

With your $500K budget targeting 5,000 customers:
$500K / 5,000 = $100 per customer

This means you'd need to spend $100 in advertising to acquire each customer who generates $60 in revenue. That's challenging since you'd lose $40 per customer.

What's your typical profit margin on a $60 order? This will help us understand how much you can actually afford to spend per customer.

Turn 4:
Exactly right! Customer lifetime value changes everything. With 60-70% margins, you're making $35-40 profit per order, which is solid.

For natural supplements, customers typically reorder 2-4 times per year if they like the products. Let's model conservatively at 2.5 orders annually:

$40 profit per order × 2.5 orders = $100 annual customer value

Now the math works: $500K budget / 5,000 customers = $100 per customer, which equals your annual customer value of $100.

This assumes you break even in year one and profit comes from repeat purchases in year two and beyond. 

Does 2-3 reorders per year sound realistic for your supplement customers, or do you think it would be higher or lower?

Turn 5:
Perfect! With 3-4 reorders annually, your economics look even stronger:

$40 profit per order × 3.5 orders = $140 annual customer value

This gives you healthy cushion: spending $100 to acquire customers worth $140 annually means $40 profit per customer in year one alone.

Your target is achievable. Natural supplement brands typically see $80-120 acquisition costs, so your $100 target sits right in the realistic range.

Now that we've confirmed your economics work, let's define your target audience. You mentioned "health-conscious people" on the West Coast. Can you describe your ideal customer in more detail - age range, lifestyle, specific health interests?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 7:
Smart approach! Focusing on major metros where your wellness-focused audience concentrates makes sense. Your allocation reflects market size well.

Let me map this to specific markets with population data:

**CALIFORNIA (60% focus)**
- Los Angeles DMA: 5.2M households
- San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose DMA: 2.5M households  
- San Diego DMA: 1.2M households

**WASHINGTON (25% focus)**
- Seattle-Tacoma DMA: 1.8M households

**OREGON (15% focus)**
- Portland DMA: 1.2M households

Your target audience (health-conscious 28-42 year-olds, higher income, wellness-focused) likely represents 8-12% of these metro populations.

With your $500K budget:
- California metros: 60% × $500K = $300K
- Seattle: 25% × $500K = $125K  
- Portland: 15% × $500K = $75K

Does this geographic focus and budget split align with your strategy?

Turn 8:
Good strategic thinking! You're right that 8-12% across these metros is still a large audience - roughly 800,000-1.2M people total.

For a $500K brand awareness campaign launching in new markets, that's actually the right scale to start with. Here's why:

**Audience size:** $500K / 1M target audience = $0.50 per person in media spend
**Frequency consideration:** To build brand awareness, you typically need 3-5 exposures per person, so you're looking at $0.10-0.17 per impression

This matches well with digital display and video rates for quality wellness content.

You could narrow further by adding signals like:
- Supplement purchasers (online behavior)
- Fitness app users  
- Organic/natural food buyers
- Wellness content consumers

But for brand awareness, broader reach often works better than hyper-targeting. You want to introduce GreenLeaf to the full wellness-minded population, not just current supplement buyers.

What's your instinct - cast a wider net for awareness, or focus more narrowly on proven supplement buyers?

Turn 9:
Perfect approach! You're thinking like a smart brand marketer - reaching wellness-minded people before they're actively shopping supplements. That broader reach with relevant signals is ideal for building awareness.

Your $500K budget is well-positioned for this strategy. At roughly $0.50 per target person across your metro markets, you can achieve meaningful frequency for brand building while staying efficient.

Now let's talk about your value proposition. When you introduce GreenLeaf to these new West Coast customers, what's your key message? What makes your supplements different from what they might find at Whole Foods or other natural brands they already know?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent profile! You've described a well-defined audience: health-conscious millennials and Gen Z (late 20s to early 40s) who prioritize quality, convenience, and natural products.

Since you're launching in California, Oregon, and Washington, are you planning to target all three states equally, or do you want to focus more heavily on certain areas? For example, major metro areas like LA, SF, Seattle, or Portland versus broader statewide coverage?

Turn 11:
Great instincts! Instagram is perfect for wellness brands - highly visual, strong wellness community, and excellent for showcasing ingredient transparency and science-backed messaging.

Connected TV reaches your audience watching wellness/fitness content on streaming platforms like Hulu, YouTube TV. For brand awareness, it's powerful because:
- Premium video format builds credibility
- Targets wellness content viewers specifically  
- Typically $15-25 CPM (cost per thousand views)

You're smart to be thoughtful about TikTok. While 28-35 year-olds are active there, your wellness-focused, quality-conscious audience skews more Instagram/Facebook.

Here's a suggested allocation for your $500K:
- Instagram/Facebook: 40% = $200K (awareness + engagement)
- Connected TV: 30% = $150K (premium brand building)
- Search: 20% = $100K (brand protection + discovery)  
- Digital display: 10% = $50K (retargeting + reach extension)

This gives you broad reach through TV, deep engagement on Instagram, and captures interest through search.

Does this mix feel right for introducing GreenLeaf to the West Coast?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Excellent positioning! You have three strong differentiators: clean sourcing with transparency, science-based formulations, and direct-to-consumer value.

For brand awareness campaigns, your message hierarchy could be:
**Primary:** "Science-backed supplements with ingredients you can trust"
**Supporting points:** Third-party tested purity, transparent sourcing, nutrition science expertise

This positions you above commodity supplements while being accessible to wellness newcomers.

Now for channels. With your $500K budget, broad wellness audience, and brand awareness goal, you'll want a mix that delivers both reach and credibility. 

Based on your target audience and objectives, I'm seeing strong potential for:
- Connected TV/streaming (wellness content viewers)
- Social media (Instagram/TikTok wellness community)  
- Digital display (health/fitness websites)
- Search (brand protection as awareness grows)

What's your experience with these channels? Any you're particularly interested in or want to avoid?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 12:
Great questions! 

**Brand protection** means bidding on your own brand name "GreenLeaf Wellness" so when people search for you, your ad appears at the top. Without this, competitors could bid on your brand name and steal traffic from your awareness campaigns. It's defensive but essential.

**Influencer marketing** is typically separate from paid media budgets. Your $200K Instagram allocation covers:
- Paid posts/stories to your target audience
- Video ads showcasing your science/transparency
- Retargeting people who visited your website

Influencers would be additional - usually $50-200K depending on tier (micro vs macro influencers). Many wellness brands find micro-influencers (10K-100K followers) more authentic and cost-effective than big names.

For measurement, we'll track:
- Brand awareness lift (surveys)
- Website traffic by source  
- Cost per customer: $500K / 5,000 = $100 target
- Customer acquisition across channels

How important is tracking brand awareness specifically versus just focusing on sales and website visits?
