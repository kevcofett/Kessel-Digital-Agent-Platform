# Media Plan Output: Mass National Campaign - Simplicity Test

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

For your FreshBite Snacks launch, I need to clarify your business outcome. When you say "drive awareness," what specific business result are you targeting? Are you looking to:
- Build brand recognition before driving sales later
- Support retail placement and distribution goals  
- Increase consideration for future purchase
- Something else entirely

This helps determine how we measure success beyond brand lift studies.

Turn 2:
Perfect! Building brand recognition and consideration for a new product line is a clear foundation objective. 

For your primary success metric, brand lift studies will show awareness and consideration increases. What specific lift target are you aiming for? For example:
- X% increase in unaided brand awareness
- X% increase in purchase consideration
- X% increase in brand familiarity

Having a specific percentage target helps us model reach requirements and validate if your $8M budget can deliver the frequency needed to move these metrics meaningfully.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it. I'll model using 15% brand awareness lift and 10% consideration lift based on new product launch benchmarks. You can refine these anytime.

For awareness campaigns targeting adults 18-54 nationally, you typically need 3-5 frequency against your target to move brand metrics meaningfully. With 140M adults in that demo:

$8M budget could deliver roughly 3.5-4.0 frequency if allocated efficiently across channels. This projects to meaningful brand lift potential.

Your targets are ambitious but achievable - new CPG launches with $8M+ often hit 10-20% awareness lift when executed well. The key will be tight creative strategy and smart channel mix.

Moving to economics: Do you have any sense of what a new customer is worth to FreshBite over time, or should I model using typical snack category benchmarks?

Turn 4:
For snack brands, customer lifetime value typically runs $40-80 annually based on category benchmarks. Your $50-100 estimate is reasonable - I'll model at $75 LTV (midpoint of your range).

But here's the key insight: brand awareness campaigns don't convert immediately. You're building recognition now for purchases 3-6 months later. So we need to think about this differently than direct response.

$8M / 140M adults 18-54 = roughly $0.06 per person reached. At 3.5 frequency, that's about $0.21 per person for meaningful exposure. This is very efficient for national brand building.

The real question: what percentage of your target audience needs to become aware to justify the $8M investment? If 10% of aware consumers eventually try the product at $75 LTV, we can work backwards to see if the math supports your investment.

How many people do you estimate need to become aware of FreshBite to drive meaningful trial and sales?

Turn 5:
Excellent thinking! 20-25% awareness (28-35M people) is realistic for an $8M national launch. Your trial rate assumption needs adjustment though.

CPG benchmarks show 2-4% of aware consumers typically try new snack products within 12 months. At 30M aware people:
- 2% trial rate = 600K new customers  
- 4% trial rate = 1.2M new customers

At $75 LTV:
600K customers × $75 = $45M lifetime value
1.2M customers × $75 = $90M lifetime value

$8M investment for $45-90M potential return shows strong economics, even accounting for the delayed timeline.

Your plan is economically sound. The 3.5-4.0 frequency at $8M budget should deliver the 20-25% awareness you need, and typical trial conversion rates support meaningful business impact.

Ready to move to audience definition? We need to get more specific than "adults 18-54" to optimize your targeting and channel selection.

Turn 6:
Great direction! Primary grocery shoppers who buy premium/healthier snacks is much more strategic than broad 18-54.

Let's size this refined audience. Premium snack buyers typically represent 25-30% of total snack purchasers. Female grocery shoppers 25-54 (primary household buyers) number roughly 45M nationally.

45M women × 30% premium snack buyers = ~13.5M core audience

This is much more efficient than 140M broad reach. At $8M budget:
$8M against 13.5M = $0.59 per person vs $0.06 against full 18-54 demo

Higher cost per person but dramatically better relevance and conversion potential.

Should we include male premium snack buyers as a secondary audience, or any specific behavioral signals like organic food purchasers or fitness enthusiasts who might align with your upmarket positioning?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 7:
Perfect targeting refinement! Let's size this layered audience:

**Primary:** Women 25-54, premium snack buyers = 13.5M
**Secondary:** Men 25-45, premium snack buyers = ~8.5M  
**Core audience total:** 22M people

Adding behavioral overlays:
- Organic food purchasers: ~40% of premium snack buyers
- Fitness/protein bar buyers: ~25% of premium snack buyers

22M × 40% organic buyers = 8.8M highly aligned audience
22M × 25% fitness buyers = 5.5M highly aligned audience

With some overlap between organic and fitness behaviors, your total addressable audience is roughly **20-22M people** with strong purchase intent signals.

Budget efficiency check:
$8M / 20M people = $0.40 per person reached
At 3.5 frequency = $1.40 per person for meaningful exposure

This is excellent efficiency for premium CPG targeting. Much better conversion potential than broad reach.

Ready to define geography, or do you want to refine any audience signals first?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Great question! Premium snack consumption definitely varies by geography. Based on category data, premium/organic snack buyers over-index in:

**Top-indexing markets:**
- West Coast (Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, LA) - 130-150% index
- Northeast corridor (Boston, NYC, DC) - 120-140% index  
- Select metros (Denver, Austin, Minneapolis) - 115-130% index

**National launch options:**
1. **Even national allocation:** $8M spread proportionally by population
2. **Index-weighted:** Allocate 60% to high-index markets, 40% to remaining
3. **Phased approach:** Launch in top 25 DMAs first, expand after 8-12 weeks

Index-weighted example:
60% of $8M = $4.8M against top-indexing markets (covers ~45% of US population)
40% of $8M = $3.2M against remaining markets

This concentrates spend where your audience is most receptive while maintaining national presence.

What's your retail distribution strategy? Are you launching everywhere simultaneously or rolling out by region?

Turn 9:
Excellent strategic thinking! Index-weighted with national distribution maximizes efficiency while supporting your retail partnerships everywhere.

**Budget allocation breakdown:**
- High-index markets: $4.8M covering 45% population = $10.67 per person reached
- Remaining markets: $3.2M covering 55% population = $5.82 per person reached

At 3.5 frequency:
- High-index: $37.35 per person for meaningful exposure  
- Remaining: $20.37 per person for meaningful exposure

This creates stronger frequency in your best markets while maintaining awareness nationally. Smart approach for a premium brand launch.

Now let's nail down your total budget allocation. You mentioned $8M total - is this purely for media spend, or does it include creative production, research, and other campaign costs? We need to know your working media budget to optimize channel selection.

Turn 10:
Perfect! $8M in pure working media gives us maximum efficiency. No production carve-outs means every dollar drives reach and frequency.

Before we dive into channels in Step 7, let's define your value proposition messaging framework. For a new premium snack line competing against established brands, your messaging needs to break through and create differentiation.

What's your core value proposition? Are you positioning FreshBite around:
- Specific health benefits (protein, organic, clean ingredients)
- Taste superiority and premium quality  
- Convenience and lifestyle fit
- Something else that sets you apart from existing snack options

This messaging foundation determines which channels will be most effective and how we allocate that $8M across touchpoints.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Excellent positioning! "Snacks made right" with clean ingredients that don't sacrifice taste hits the perfect sweet spot for premium snack buyers. That messaging bridges the gap between indulgent and overly healthy - smart differentiation.

This value proposition works beautifully for awareness building because it's:
- Simple enough to communicate in short-form creative
- Emotionally resonant (feel good about choices without sacrifice)  
- Differentiating against both junk food AND health-focused competitors

Your messaging supports multiple creative formats - ingredient storytelling, taste demonstrations, lifestyle integration. This gives us flexibility across channels.

Now for channel strategy. With $8M working media, brand awareness objective, and "snacks made right" messaging, we need channels that deliver:
- Strong reach against premium snack buyers
- Creative formats that showcase ingredients AND taste
- Frequency for message retention

What channels are you already considering, or should I recommend the optimal mix based on your objectives and audience?

Turn 12:
Excellent channel instincts! TV/CTV, YouTube, and display create a strong awareness foundation. Let me break down the optimal allocation for your $8M:

**Recommended channel mix:**
- **Linear TV:** 35% = $2.8M (broad reach, brand building credibility)
- **Connected TV:** 25% = $2.0M (cord-cutter reach, precise targeting) 
- **YouTube:** 20% = $1.6M (ingredient storytelling, taste demos)
- **Programmatic Display:** 15% = $1.2M (retargeting, reinforcement)
- **Paid Social:** 5% = $400K (premium audience targeting)

**TV vs CTV split rationale:**
35% linear captures mass reach efficiently at ~$25-35 CPMs
25% CTV targets cord-cutters and premium demos at ~$45-65 CPMs

This 60% video allocation delivers the frequency needed for awareness lift while YouTube enables longer-form "snacks made right" storytelling.

One addition to consider: **Podcast advertising** over-indexes heavily with premium snack buyers and organic food purchasers. Should we test 5% ($400K) in podcasts instead of some display budget?

Turn 13:
Excellent call on podcasts! Premium snack buyers over-index 2-3x in podcast consumption, especially food/lifestyle shows.

**Revised allocation:**
- Linear TV: 35% = $2.8M
- Connected TV: 25% = $2.0M  
- YouTube: 20% = $1.6M
- Programmatic Display: 10% = $800K (retargeting focus)
- Podcasts: 5% = $400K (premium audience test)
- Paid Social: 5% = $400K

You're absolutely right to question the $400K social allocation. For brand awareness campaigns, $400K across Meta/Instagram typically delivers limited scale - maybe 15-20M impressions monthly.

**Two better options:**
1. **Eliminate social entirely:** Move $400K to YouTube (total $2M) for stronger video storytelling
2. **Eliminate social:** Move $400K to CTV (total $2.4M) for premium audience concentration

Given your "snacks made right" messaging needs visual storytelling, I'd recommend Option 1: **$2M YouTube budget** enables more ingredient showcases and taste demonstrations.

Final mix: TV 35%, CTV 25%, YouTube 25%, Display 10%, Podcasts 5%. Thoughts?

Turn 14:
Perfect! That allocation maximizes your storytelling potential while delivering the reach and frequency needed for meaningful brand lift.

**Budget efficiency check:**
$8M across 20M target audience = $400 per thousand reached
At 3.5 frequency = $1,400 per thousand for meaningful exposure

This positions you well to hit those 15% awareness and 10% consideration lift targets.

For measurement, you mentioned brand lift studies as your primary success metric. Given this channel mix, I recommend:

**Measurement framework:**
- **Brand lift studies:** Quarterly waves measuring awareness, consideration, purchase intent
- **Cross-channel attribution:** Track assisted conversions from upper-funnel video
- **Incrementality testing:** Geo-holdout tests for TV/CTV impact validation
- **Creative performance:** YouTube view-through rates, completion rates by message variant

The podcast test will be particularly valuable to measure - premium audience engagement could inform future budget shifts.

Should we move to testing strategy, or do you want to dive deeper into any measurement specifics first?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 16:
Excellent risk identification! Both creative fatigue and competitive response are real threats for new premium brands.

**Creative fatigue mitigation:**
- Deploy 4-5 creative variants from launch (not sequential testing) to extend lifespan
- Monitor completion rate decay - YouTube drop below 70%, CTV below 80% signals refresh needed
- Build modular creative system: same core message, different ingredient spotlights/usage occasions
- Reserve 15% of production budget for mid-flight creative development

**Competitive response strategy:**
- **Monitor share of voice:** Track competitive spending in your key markets weekly
- **Agility reserve:** Keep that $800K holdback flexible for defensive spending if needed
- **Channel diversification advantage:** Your podcast/YouTube mix is harder for big brands to quickly replicate
- **Message differentiation:** "Snacks made right" is defensible positioning vs generic "tastes great" responses

**Early warning signals:**
- Brand lift plateau despite maintained reach/frequency
- Cost inflation in programmatic channels (competitive bidding)
- Declining organic search volume for your brand terms

**Contingency:** If major competitor launches counter-campaign, shift 20% budget from broad reach (linear TV) to precision targeting (CTV/YouTube) where your message differentiation is clearest.

Ready to finalize your plan, or other risks to address?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 15:
Excellent! Creative testing is crucial with your storytelling-heavy approach across different formats.

**Testing strategy by channel:**

**TV/CTV testing:**
- Test 2-3 creative variants: ingredient-focused vs. taste-focused vs. lifestyle integration
- 30-second format optimization for "snacks made right" message hierarchy
- A/B test across similar DMAs to isolate creative impact

**YouTube testing:**
- Test multiple formats: 15-sec bumpers, 30-sec skippables, 60-sec storytelling
- Creative variants: ingredient deep-dive vs. taste comparison vs. real-life usage
- Optimize for view-through completion rates and brand lift correlation

**Risk mitigation:**
- Hold back 10% of budget ($800K) for mid-flight optimization based on early performance
- Plan creative refresh at 8-week mark if frequency burns out messaging
- Podcast creative should mirror top-performing YouTube messages for consistency

**Testing timeline:**
Weeks 1-4: Initial performance data and brand lift baseline
Weeks 5-8: Optimize based on completion rates and early lift indicators  
Weeks 9-12: Deploy winning creative variants with reserved budget

What's your biggest concern about potential campaign risks we should plan for?
