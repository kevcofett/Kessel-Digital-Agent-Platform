# Media Plan Output: Precision Targeting with Complex Attributes

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I am excited to build a media plan with you. We will cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Your brief shows sophisticated targeting. Let me start with a quick efficiency check: $1.5M / 2,500 leads = $600 per qualified lead. For HNW wealth management, this is conservative - industry benchmarks typically run $800-1,200 per qualified lead given the audience exclusivity.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 2,500 qualified leads?

Turn 2:
Perfect. Let me model the economics to assess feasibility:

**Volume & Conversion Math:**
2,500 MQLs → 275 clients (midpoint) = 11% lead-to-client conversion
275 clients × $3.5M average AUM = $962M total AUM (exceeding your $750M target)

**Lead Economics:**
$1.5M / 2,500 = $600 per MQL
At 11% conversion: $600 ÷ 0.11 = $5,455 per new client

**Revenue Validation:**
Assuming 1% management fee: $3.5M × 1% = $35,000 annual revenue per client
$35,000 ÷ $5,455 = 6.4x first-year revenue multiple

This is highly efficient for wealth management. Your sales team's 11% MQL conversion rate is ambitious but achievable with proper lead qualification. The $600 CPL assumption may need adjustment - HNW targeting typically runs $800-1,200 per qualified lead due to audience scarcity.

What's your primary KPI for measuring campaign success - MQL volume, conversion rate to clients, or total AUM acquired?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - focusing on total AUM as primary KPI makes perfect sense for wealth management ROI.

Your 30% MQL-to-SQL rate is strong, which suggests good lead qualification. Let me recalibrate the conversion funnel:

**Revised Funnel Analysis:**
2,500 MQLs → 750 SQLs (30%) → 275 clients = 37% SQL-to-client conversion

That 37% SQL conversion rate is much more realistic for HNW wealth management. The bottleneck appears to be MQL qualification rather than sales execution.

**CPL Reality Check:**
At market rates of $800-1,200 per qualified lead:
- Conservative: $800 × 2,500 = $2.0M budget needed
- Aggressive: $1,200 × 2,500 = $3.0M budget needed

**Strategic Options:**
1. Reduce volume target to 1,875 leads at $800 CPL = $1.5M budget
2. Increase budget to $2.0M for 2,500 leads at realistic efficiency
3. Focus on ultra-high qualification to improve MQL-to-SQL rates

Given your quality-over-volume preference and the $962M AUM projection being well above target, would you consider option 1 - fewer but higher-quality leads within your $1.5M budget?

Turn 5:
Excellent. Your estate planning calculator success and rich CRM data give us strong foundations for precision targeting.

**Economics Confirmed:**
1,875 leads × $800 = $1.5M budget
Projected: 243 new clients → $850M AUM (13% above $750M target)

Now for audience precision. With 50K existing clients, we can build powerful lookalike models from your highest-value segments.

**First-Party Data Opportunity:**
Your CRM likely contains patterns showing which acquisition sources, engagement behaviors, and demographic profiles predict larger AUM and faster conversion. We can use this to weight our targeting.

**HNW Audience Considerations:**
Beyond the $1M+ investable assets and 45-65 age range, we need to layer behavioral and life-stage signals. The "approaching retirement or major liquidity event" criteria is crucial but requires specific targeting approaches.

Starting with behavioral signals: Which specific research behaviors or life events have you observed among your best converting prospects? For example, do they typically research specific topics, visit certain website sections, or engage with particular content types before converting?

Turn 6:
Excellent behavioral intelligence. This gives us precise targeting layers:

**High-Intent Content Signals:**
- Capital gains strategy research
- Charitable giving vehicles (DAFs, charitable trusts)
- Business succession planning
- Tax-loss harvesting
- Wealth transfer strategies

**Life Event Indicators:**
- Recent IPO participants (track company announcements)
- Business sale activity (M&A databases)
- Stock option exercise timing (pre-IPO company employees)

**Engagement Pattern:**
3-4x content consumption vs general inquiries = premium qualification signal

**Audience Layering Strategy:**
Primary: Lookalikes from clients with $3M+ AUM who engaged with tax optimization content
Secondary: Behavioral targeting around recent liquidity events + wealth transfer research
Tertiary: Life stage targeting (pre-retirement executives) + high-engagement content patterns

**Geographic Concentration Question:**
Within your top DMAs (NYC, SF, LA, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Denver, Miami, Dallas, DC), have you noticed any patterns in where your highest-value conversions concentrate? For example, do certain zip codes or metro areas produce disproportionately larger AUM clients?

Turn 7:
Outstanding geographic intelligence. This zip-level precision will dramatically improve efficiency:

**Tier 1 Markets (Weight 40% of budget):**
- SF Bay Area: Tech equity concentration, $4-5M average AUM
- Seattle: Microsoft/Amazon executives, $4-5M average AUM  
- Manhattan UES: Finance executives, family offices

**Tier 2 Markets (Weight 35% of budget):**
- LA: Beverly Hills, Manhattan Beach, Palos Verdes - entertainment/tech wealth
- Chicago: North Shore suburbs - established wealth
- Boston: Cambridge/Newton - biotech/academic wealth

**Tier 3 Markets (Weight 25% of budget):**
- Denver, Miami, Dallas, DC - broader HNW targeting

**Geographic Targeting Strategy:**
$1.5M budget × 40% = $600K for Tier 1 markets
At $800 CPL: 750 leads from highest-value zip codes
Expected conversion: 750 × 35% × 37% = 97 clients × $4.5M average = $437M AUM from top tier alone

This geographic weighting should push your total AUM well above the $850M projection.

Do you have data on which of these markets respond best to different value propositions - for example, does tax optimization messaging resonate more in high-tax states like CA/NY versus estate planning focus in other markets?

Turn 8:
Brilliant insight on geo-specific messaging preferences. This level of personalization will significantly boost conversion rates:

**Message-Market Optimization:**

**CA/NY (High-Tax States):** Lead with tax optimization, capital gains strategies, charitable giving vehicles. CTAs like "Reduce Your Tax Burden" or "Maximize After-Tax Wealth"

**Seattle:** Dual focus on equity compensation strategies + business succession. "Navigate Your Tech Equity" messaging

**Chicago:** Estate planning and wealth preservation focus. "Protect Generational Wealth" positioning  

**Boston:** Bifurcated approach - tax optimization for biotech executives, traditional estate planning for academic wealth

**Geographic Creative Testing Opportunity:**
Your $1.5M budget supports 3-4 creative variants per market. Given the 2-3x engagement lift you see with relevant messaging, geo-specific creative could improve your overall conversion rate from 35% to 40%+ MQL-to-SQL.

**Revised Projection with Geo-Messaging:**
1,875 leads × 40% MQL-to-SQL × 37% SQL-to-client = 278 clients
278 clients × $3.8M weighted average AUM = $1.06B total AUM

This puts you 41% above your $750M target.

Should we lock in this geographic weighting and messaging framework, then move to Step 5 to detail the budget allocation across these market tiers?

Turn 9:
Perfect! Geographic strategy locked in with strong upside potential to $1.06B AUM.

**Step 5: Budget Allocation Framework**

**Tier 1 Markets - $600K (40% of budget):**
- SF Bay Area: $240K → 300 leads
- Seattle: $180K → 225 leads  
- Manhattan UES: $180K → 225 leads

**Tier 2 Markets - $525K (35% of budget):**
- LA (Beverly Hills/Manhattan Beach): $175K → 219 leads
- Chicago (North Shore): $175K → 219 leads
- Boston (Cambridge/Newton): $175K → 219 leads

**Tier 3 Markets - $375K (25% of budget):**
- Denver, Miami, Dallas, DC: $94K each → 117 leads per market

**Total: 1,875 leads at $800 average CPL**

This allocation weights spend toward your highest-AUM markets while maintaining presence in all target DMAs.

Within each market tier, how should we split budget between acquisition of net new prospects versus remarketing to your existing prospect database and lookalike expansion from your 50K client CRM data?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Smart question. Higher CPL enables better qualification through several key levers:

**Quality Improvement Mechanisms at $800 CPL:**

**Audience Precision:** Tighter income/asset targeting ($1M+ investable vs $500K+ household income), behavioral signals like recent stock option exercises or business sale research, and lookalike modeling from your highest-value existing clients.

**Content Qualification:** Gated premium content (tax optimization guides, estate planning calculators) that naturally filters for serious prospects vs general financial content that attracts browsers.

**Channel Selection:** Wealth management publications, LinkedIn targeting by job titles/companies, and direct mail to high-net-worth neighborhoods vs broad digital channels.

**Lead Scoring Enhancement:** Use your 50K client CRM data to identify patterns - which acquisition sources, content engagement, and demographic signals predict higher SQL conversion and larger AUM.

The $800 CPL budget allows you to be selective on these dimensions rather than casting a wide net. 

**Revised Target:** 1,875 MQLs × 35% MQL-to-SQL (improved) × 37% SQL-to-client = 243 clients × $3.5M = $850M AUM

This actually exceeds your original $750M target with fewer leads. Should we proceed with the 1,875 lead target at $800 CPL and focus on audience precision in Step 3?

Turn 11:
Perfect differentiators that directly address HNW pain points. This gives us compelling value propositions for each market:

**Core Value Proposition Framework:**

**Primary Differentiator:** "Boutique expertise with institutional resources"
- Specialized focus vs wirehouse generalists
- 50-75 client loads vs 200+ relationships
- Custom solutions vs standardized products

**Market-Specific Value Props:**

**CA/NY (Tax-Focused):** "Advanced tax optimization unavailable at wirehouses - proprietary tools for complex liquidity events"

**Seattle (Equity-Heavy):** "Specialized tech equity strategies with faster execution than corporate constraints allow"

**Chicago (Estate Planning):** "Personalized wealth preservation with 15+ years average advisor experience"

**Boston (Bifurcated):** "Boutique agility for biotech complexity + traditional estate planning expertise"

**Proof Points Across All Markets:**
- 50-75 client relationships per advisor vs 200+ at wirehouses
- Proprietary tax optimization tools (like your calculator)
- Direct alternative investment access
- Faster decision-making without corporate bureaucracy

This positioning should resonate strongly with prospects frustrated by wirehouse limitations.

Ready to move to Step 7 for channel strategy, or do you want to refine any messaging elements first?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 10:
Excellent allocation strategy. Leveraging your first-party data advantage is smart:

**Budget Split Across Acquisition Types:**

**Lookalike Expansion (60% = $900K):**
- Tier 1: $360K for SF/Seattle/NYC lookalikes
- Tier 2: $315K for LA/Chicago/Boston lookalikes  
- Tier 3: $225K for remaining markets
- Target: 1,125 leads from highest-propensity audiences

**Remarketing (25% = $375K):**
- 15-20K existing prospects → advanced content (succession planning, wealth transfer)
- Target: 469 leads from warm audience
- Expected higher conversion: 45% MQL-to-SQL vs 40% for lookalikes

**Cold Acquisition (15% = $225K):**
- Net new reach expansion
- Target: 281 leads for audience growth

**Conversion Projection with Mixed Funnel:**
- Lookalikes: 1,125 × 40% × 37% = 167 clients
- Remarketing: 469 × 45% × 37% = 78 clients  
- Cold: 281 × 35% × 37% = 36 clients
- **Total: 281 clients → $1.07B AUM**

Now for value proposition: Given your geo-specific messaging framework, what's your core differentiator against competitors like Morgan Stanley or UBS when targeting these HNW prospects?

Turn 13:
Excellent points - both CTV and podcast sponsorship are smart additions for this audience:

**Revised Channel Mix:**

**Tier 1 Markets ($600K) - Tech/Finance Heavy:**
- LinkedIn: 40% ($240K) - Executive targeting, equity compensation content
- Financial Publishers: 20% ($120K) - WSJ, Barron's, Bloomberg
- Connected TV: 15% ($90K) - Remarketing to lookalikes, cord-cutting executives
- Podcast Sponsorship: 15% ($90K) - Finance/business podcasts, commute targeting
- Direct Mail: 10% ($60K) - Premium zip codes

**Tier 2 Markets ($525K) - Mixed Wealth:**
- Financial Publishers: 35% ($184K) - Traditional wealth publications
- LinkedIn: 25% ($131K) - Professional targeting
- Podcast Sponsorship: 20% ($105K) - Business podcasts, wealth management shows
- Programmatic Display: 10% ($53K) - Estate planning sites
- Direct Mail: 10% ($52K) - Affluent neighborhoods

**Tier 3 Markets ($375K) - Broader HNW:**
- Financial Publishers: 40% ($150K) - Local business journals
- LinkedIn: 25% ($94K) - Executive targeting
- Podcast Sponsorship: 20% ($75K) - Regional business shows
- Programmatic Display: 10% ($38K) - Financial content
- Direct Mail: 5% ($18K) - High-income areas

This gives you stronger remarketing capabilities with CTV and captures the commute/multitasking behavior with podcasts. Does this revised mix better reflect your successful channels?

Turn 14:
Great question on print vs digital mix. Your tracking insight is key - digital for lead capture, print for credibility:

**Financial Publisher Allocation Strategy:**

**Tier 1 Markets (Tech/Finance):**
- Digital: 80% - Higher digital adoption, immediate lead capture
- Print: 20% - Brand credibility for larger AUM prospects

**Tier 2 Markets (Mixed Wealth):**
- Digital: 70% - Balance of performance and credibility  
- Print: 30% - Traditional wealth values print authority

**Tier 3 Markets (Broader HNW):**
- Digital: 65% - Lead capture priority
- Print: 35% - Regional business journals, local credibility

**Rationale:**
Your 45-65 age range spans digital natives (younger tech executives) and print-preferring traditional wealth. The older, higher-AUM prospects often view print as more prestigious, while digital enables immediate conversion tracking.

**Measurement Consideration:**
Print attribution is challenging but brand lift studies show print typically increases digital conversion rates 15-25% when running concurrently. The credibility halo effect supports your digital lead capture.

This gives you performance optimization with brand authority protection. Ready for Step 8 to set up measurement frameworks that can track both direct response and brand lift effects?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 12:
**Step 7: Channel Strategy**

Excellent intuition on channel-market fit. Let's optimize the mix based on your audience behaviors and market characteristics:

**Tier 1 Markets ($600K) - Tech/Finance Heavy:**
- LinkedIn: 45% ($270K) - Executive targeting, equity compensation content
- Financial Publishers: 25% ($150K) - Barron's, WSJ, Bloomberg targeting
- Programmatic Display: 20% ($120K) - Wealth management sites, lookalike retargeting
- Direct Mail: 10% ($60K) - High-net-worth zip codes

**Tier 2 Markets ($525K) - Mixed Wealth:**
- LinkedIn: 35% ($184K) - Professional targeting with geo-specific messaging
- Financial Publishers: 35% ($184K) - Traditional wealth publications
- Programmatic Display: 20% ($105K) - Estate planning and tax content sites

**Tier 3 Markets ($375K) - Broader HNW:**
- Financial Publishers: 40% ($150K) - Local business journals, wealth magazines
- LinkedIn: 30% ($113K) - Executive and business owner targeting
- Programmatic Display: 20% ($75K) - Financial planning content
- Direct Mail: 10% ($37K) - High-income zip codes

**Channel Rationale:**
LinkedIn dominates Tier 1 due to tech/finance concentration. Financial publishers increase in Tier 2/3 for traditional wealth. Direct mail provides premium touchpoint across all tiers.

Does this channel weighting align with your experience of where these audiences engage most?

Turn 16:
Perfect - you have the foundational data infrastructure to build sophisticated measurement. Let's upgrade your attribution systematically:

**Phase 1: Quick Wins (30-60 days):**
- Implement dynamic number insertion for podcasts: $3K setup cost
- Weight Salesforce attribution by engagement depth (your 3-4x insight)
- Create geo-holdout test framework: Print + Digital vs Digital-only across DMAs

**Phase 2: MMM Implementation (60-90 days):**
- Partner with attribution vendor (Measured, Northbeam, or similar): $15-25K quarterly
- Build first-party lookalike scoring using your 50K client behavioral patterns
- Implement brand lift surveys for print placements: $5K per wave

**Immediate CRM Enhancement:**
Use your existing engagement scoring to create weighted attribution:
- Estate planning calculator completion: 4x weight
- Tax optimization content: 3x weight  
- General content: 1x weight

**Geo-Holdout Test Design:**
- Test Markets: SF, Chicago (print + digital)
- Control Markets: Seattle, Boston (digital only)
- Measure: Digital conversion rate lift during print flights
- Duration: 90-day cycles

**Budget Allocation for Measurement:**
Reserve 3-5% of media budget ($45-75K) for attribution technology and testing.

This measurement upgrade should give you definitive ROI data for each channel. Ready for Step 9 to design testing strategies that optimize performance while these measurement systems come online?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 15:
**Step 8: Measurement Framework**

Excellent - cross-channel attribution for HNW audiences requires sophisticated measurement given their longer consideration cycles and multiple touchpoints.

**Primary Measurement Stack:**

**1. Incrementality Testing (Gold Standard):**
- Geo-holdout tests by DMA to measure true lift
- Print brand lift studies using survey methodology
- CTV reach/frequency studies vs control groups

**2. Multi-Touch Attribution (MTA):**
- First-party data modeling using your 50K client database
- 90-day attribution window (matches your typical sales cycle)
- Weight touchpoints by engagement depth (your 3-4x content consumption insight)

**3. Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM):**
- Quarterly analysis across all channels
- Captures print "halo effect" on digital performance
- Accounts for external factors (market conditions, seasonality)

**Cross-Channel Journey Tracking:**
- UTM parameters with channel + market + message variants
- CRM integration tracking content engagement progression
- Phone call attribution using dynamic number insertion

**Print Halo Measurement:**
Run concurrent print + digital in test markets vs digital-only in control markets. Measure digital conversion rate lift during print flight periods.

**Key Metrics by Channel:**
LinkedIn: Click-to-MQL rate, cost per SQL
Financial Publishers: Brand recall lift, assisted conversions
Podcasts: Download-to-site visits, attribution via promo codes

How sophisticated is your current attribution setup - do you have MMM capabilities or primarily last-click attribution?

Turn 18:
Absolutely - running audience and creative tests concurrently is smart since they're independent variables. The $150K testing budget supports both:

**Concurrent Testing Framework:**

**Audience Refinement Test ($75K budget):**
- Test A: High-engagement lookalikes (calculator completers + tax content consumers)
- Test B: Broad HNW targeting ($1M+ investable assets, 45-65 age)
- Split across all channels, 4-week test cycles
- Success metric: MQL-to-SQL conversion rate improvement

**Geographic Creative Test ($75K budget):**
- CA/NY: Tax optimization vs estate planning messaging
- Chicago/Boston: Estate planning vs tax optimization messaging  
- Seattle: Equity compensation vs general wealth management
- 6-week test cycles to account for consideration time

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Audience test could improve MQL-to-SQL from 40% to 45-50%
- Creative test could boost overall engagement 15-25% in aligned markets

**Testing Timeline:**
- Month 1: Launch both tests simultaneously
- Month 2: Mid-flight optimization based on early signals  
- Month 3: Implement winning variants, launch Phase 2 tests

This parallel approach should accelerate your path to optimal performance while generating valuable insights for future campaigns.

Ready for Step 10 to identify potential risks and mitigation strategies for this precision targeting approach?

Turn 19:
Excellent question on mid-flight optimization thresholds. For your $800 CPL targets, I'd recommend:

**Mid-Flight Decision Thresholds:**
- **Statistical Significance:** 95% confidence level + 500 leads minimum per variant
- **Performance Threshold:** 20%+ improvement in MQL-to-SQL rate
- **Budget Shift:** Reallocate 25% toward winning variant at Month 2, full shift at Month 3

This balances statistical rigor with performance optimization.

**Step 10: Risk Assessment & Mitigation**

**Primary Risks Identified:**

**1. Audience Saturation (HIGH RISK)**
- Risk: Precision targeting exhausts qualified prospects quickly
- Mitigation: Rotate creative every 3-4 weeks, expand lookalike percentages gradually (1% → 2% → 3%), maintain 15% cold acquisition for fresh audience

**2. Regulatory Compliance (HIGH RISK)**  
- Risk: Financial advertising claims trigger SEC/FINRA scrutiny
- Mitigation: Legal review all creative variants, avoid performance guarantees, include required disclosures, focus on educational content vs promotional claims

**3. Attribution Window Mismatch (MEDIUM RISK)**
- Risk: 90-day sales cycles vs platform optimization windows
- Mitigation: Use 7-day click attribution for optimization, 90-day for reporting, implement view-through attribution for brand channels

**4. Market Concentration Risk (MEDIUM RISK)**
- Risk: 75% budget in 6 markets creates vulnerability
- Mitigation: Monitor market-specific performance weekly, maintain Tier 3 markets as backup, prepare rapid reallocation protocols

Which of these risks concerns you most given your regulatory environment?

Turn 20:
Excellent compliance-first approach - that's exactly the right priority for wealth management. Your compliance team's FINRA expertise is invaluable.

**Enhanced Compliance Protocol:**
- Legal AND compliance review for all creative variants
- Pre-approved messaging templates by topic (tax optimization, estate planning, etc.)
- Landing page compliance audit including IA disclaimers and risk disclosures
- Monthly compliance check-ins during campaign flight

**Content Theme Expansion Strategy:**
Smart thinking on adjacent topics to combat saturation:
- **Business Valuation:** Captures pre-sale business owners
- **Retirement Income Planning:** Broader appeal, less competitive
- **Family Office Services:** Ultra-high-net-worth segment
- **Charitable Planning:** Strong in philanthropic markets like SF

This expands your addressable audience while maintaining compliance-friendly educational positioning.

**Final Campaign Summary:**
- **Budget:** $1.5M targeting 1,875 leads at $800 CPL
- **Projected Outcome:** 281 clients → $1.07B AUM (43% above target)
- **Strategy:** Geographic precision + behavioral targeting + compliance-first messaging
- **Measurement:** Phased attribution upgrade with geo-holdout testing
- **Risk Management:** Regulatory compliance priority + audience expansion protocols

You've built a sophisticated, compliant plan that should significantly exceed your $750M AUM target. Ready to execute?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 17:
**Vendor Selection for Wealth Management:**

**Measured:** Best for MMM with longer sales cycles - handles 90+ day attribution windows well, strong with financial services clients. Higher cost but robust incrementality testing.

**Northbeam:** Excellent first-party data integration, good for your CRM modeling needs. Newer but growing financial services vertical expertise.

**Alternative:** **Rockerbox** - Strong B2B attribution, proven with wealth management firms, handles complex multi-touch journeys well.

Given your 90-day sales cycles and CRM complexity, I'd recommend starting conversations with Measured and Rockerbox.

**Step 9: Testing Strategy**

Now for optimization testing while measurement systems come online:

**Phase 1 Tests (Months 1-2):**
- **Creative Testing:** Geo-specific messaging variants (tax optimization CA/NY vs estate planning Chicago)
- **Audience Testing:** High-engagement lookalikes vs broad HNW targeting
- **Channel Testing:** LinkedIn carousel vs single image for equity compensation content

**Phase 2 Tests (Months 3-4):**
- **Landing Page Testing:** Estate planning calculator variants by market
- **Offer Testing:** White papers vs webinars for lead magnets
- **Frequency Testing:** Optimal remarketing cadence for 15-20K prospect database

**Testing Budget:** Allocate 10% of each channel budget for variants ($150K total)

Which testing priority interests you most - creative variants by geography or audience refinement using your CRM patterns?

Turn 21:
**Launch Timeline Strategy:**

Absolutely launch media while implementing measurement in parallel - perfect measurement shouldn't delay performance:

**Week 1-2: Campaign Launch**
- Start media with basic attribution (your current GA + Salesforce setup)
- Implement dynamic number insertion for podcasts (quick win)
- Begin weighted attribution enhancement using engagement data

**Week 3-4: Phase 1 Measurement**
- Launch geo-holdout tests (print halo measurement)
- Start vendor conversations with Measured/Rockerbox
- Implement UTM tracking for cross-channel journeys

**Week 6-8: Optimization Phase**
- First round of audience and creative test results
- Enhanced attribution providing better insights
- Budget reallocation based on early performance

**Month 3: Full Attribution Online**
- MMM capabilities implemented
- Comprehensive cross-channel measurement
- Data-driven optimization at full scale

**Critical Point:** Your existing Salesforce multi-touch visibility gives you enough attribution to optimize intelligently while building better systems. Don't let perfect measurement delay good performance.

Start spending Monday - your targeting precision and compliance framework are solid. The measurement upgrades will make you smarter, but waiting would cost you market opportunity.

Ready to launch and iterate your way to that $1.07B AUM target?
