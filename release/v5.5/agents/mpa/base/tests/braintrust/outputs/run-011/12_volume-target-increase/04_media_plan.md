# Media Plan Output: Volume Target Increase

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your efficiency target. With your $400,000 budget and 5,000 customer goal:

$400,000 / 5,000 = $80 per customer

At $80 cost per customer against $320 customer value, you have a strong 4:1 ratio. Home goods typically sees $60-100 per customer acquisition, so you're well within realistic range.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve beyond the 5,000 customers? Are you focused on revenue growth, market share expansion, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Revenue growth through accelerated customer acquisition is clear. With 5,000 new customers at $320 average value, this projects to $1.6 million in new customer revenue.

$320 × 5,000 = $1,600,000 in new customer revenue

How will you measure success? Is it the 5,000 customer count, the $1.6M revenue target, or do you track a different primary metric like monthly recurring customers or repeat purchase rate?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent! You have clear success metrics: 5,000 new customers as the primary KPI, staying within $80 cost per customer, with $1.6M revenue as the outcome.

Now let's validate your economics. At $80 cost per customer against $320 customer value, you're targeting a 4:1 return. That's strong for home goods where 3-5:1 is typical.

Quick check on your unit economics: What's your gross margin on that $320 average order? This helps confirm you can profitably spend $80 on acquisition while covering fulfillment and other costs.

Turn 4:
Perfect! Let me show you the math:

$320 × 42% = $134 gross profit
$134 - $80 acquisition cost = $54 contribution margin

That $54 remaining to cover operations gives you healthy unit economics. Your 4:1 LTV to CAC ratio with 42% margins is solid for home goods.

Since you have strong economics and clear targets, we're ready to move to audience definition. Your $400K budget targeting 5,000 customers at $80 each is realistic and well-structured.

Who is your ideal customer? Can you describe the demographics, behaviors, or characteristics of people who typically buy your home goods?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Great profile! Homeowners 30-55, middle to upper-middle income, active on visual platforms for home inspiration. That's a well-defined audience for home goods.

Let me dig deeper on a key segment: You mentioned both new homeowners and established homeowners refreshing spaces. These likely behave very differently - new homeowners may buy multiple categories at once, while refreshers might focus on specific rooms.

Which segment drives more of your current business, or do you want to target both equally in this campaign?

Turn 6:
Excellent insight! Let's allocate your targeting to match that demand pattern:

70% focus on established homeowners refreshing/redecorating
30% focus on new homeowners setting up spaces

This means roughly 3,500 customers from refreshers and 1,500 from new homeowners out of your 5,000 target.

Now for geography: Are you selling nationwide, or do you have specific regions or markets you want to prioritize? Home goods often see regional preferences, so understanding your geographic focus will help optimize that $80 per customer target.

Turn 7:
Yes, geographic targeting could definitely improve your efficiency! Nationwide reach is valuable, but focusing on higher-performing areas can optimize your $80 per customer target.

Suburban areas with larger homes and higher disposable income typically convert 15-25% better for home goods. This could bring your effective CAC down from $80 to $65-70 in top-performing markets.

Here's what I'd recommend: Start with top 50 DMAs focusing on suburban zip codes with median household income $75K+. This covers roughly 60% of US population but likely 70-80% of your best prospects.

Does this geographic focus make sense for your brand, or do you have data showing strong performance in specific regions we should prioritize?

Turn 8:
Perfect! Geographic focus on top 50 DMAs with suburban targeting should improve your efficiency. Let's model the impact:

If geographic targeting improves performance 15-20%, your effective CAC drops:
$80 × 0.85 = $68 per customer (15% improvement)
$80 × 0.80 = $64 per customer (20% improvement)

This gives you $12-16 extra margin per customer, creating flexibility for testing and optimization.

Now let's confirm your budget allocation. With $400K total budget and 5,000 customer target at optimized $64-68 CAC, you'll have budget efficiency:

$400,000 ÷ $64-68 = 5,900-6,250 potential customers

This suggests your budget could support slightly higher volume if performance hits the optimized range. Should we stick with the 5,000 customer target, or would you want to capture that upside if efficiency improves?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Excellent approach! Let's structure this with baseline and stretch targets:

**Baseline Plan:** 5,000 customers at $80 CAC = $400K
**Optimized Plan:** 5,900-6,250 customers at $64-68 CAC = $400K

The geographic targeting creates 18-25% volume upside with the same budget. Smart to plan conservatively but capture the efficiency gains.

Now for your value proposition: With established homeowners refreshing spaces and new homeowners setting up, what's your key message that differentiates HomeStyle Direct from bigger competitors? 

Is it product selection, pricing, design inspiration, customer service, or something else that makes customers choose you over the major players?

Turn 10:
Perfect positioning! "Curated designer look without designer prices" with styling guidance is a strong differentiator in that crowded middle market.

Your value prop has three pillars:
1. Unique, curated pieces (vs mass market sameness)
2. Accessible luxury pricing (designer look, reasonable cost) 
3. Styling made simple (room collections, guides)

This messaging should resonate well with both segments - established homeowners want that fresh, curated look, while new homeowners need the styling guidance.

Now we're ready for channels. With your audience (homeowners 30-55, suburban, visual inspiration seekers) and $400K budget targeting 5,000-6,250 customers, which channels are you currently using or considering? Social, search, display, or others?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Smart foundation! Meta, Pinterest, and Google Shopping are excellent for your visual products and inspiration-seeking audience. Let's optimize your current mix and identify strategic additions.

Current strength analysis:
- Meta: Great for both audience segments, strong lookalike targeting
- Pinterest: Perfect for home inspiration, long content lifespan  
- Google Shopping: Captures purchase intent, strong for specific products

For your $400K budget targeting 5,000-6,250 customers, I'd recommend this allocation:

**Meta: 45% ($180K)** - Primary acquisition driver
**Pinterest: 25% ($100K)** - Inspiration and discovery  
**Google Shopping: 20% ($80K)** - Intent capture
**Google Search: 10% ($40K)** - Brand and category terms

This keeps 70% on your proven visual platforms while adding search for intent capture. The Google Search addition would target "home decor," "furniture," and your brand terms.

Does this channel mix feel right, or would you prefer different allocation?
