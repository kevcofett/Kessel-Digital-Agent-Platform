TURN 1 (Step 1)

USER:
Hi, I'm the Director of Digital Marketing at SecureLife Insurance. We sell life and annuity products. I need to build a media plan for next year. We have a $750K budget and need 15,000 new policy applications. Our average LTV is about $2,800 per policyholder. Can you help?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your efficiency target: $750,000 / 15,000 applications = $50 per application. With $2,800 LTV, that's a strong 56:1 return ratio - very achievable for insurance.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 15,000 applications? Are you focused on premium growth, market share expansion, or something else?

TURN 2 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Great, that $50 CPL target sounds reasonable for our industry. We're primarily focused on premium growth - we want to expand our customer base and increase our annual premium revenue. The 15,000 applications should translate to meaningful revenue growth since our conversion rates from application to policy are pretty solid, around 65%.

AGENT:
Perfect! So 15,000 applications at 65% conversion = 9,750 new policies for premium growth. That's your core business outcome.

Now let's validate if your $50 per application target is realistic. At $2,800 LTV per policyholder, you can afford up to $1,820 per application and still break even ($2,800 × 65% conversion). Your $50 target is extremely conservative - you're targeting just 2.7% of what you could afford.

This suggests either: 1) Very aggressive growth goals, 2) Conservative budgeting, or 3) Opportunity to scale much larger.

Is this $750K budget a constraint, or could you invest more if we prove efficiency at this level?

TURN 3 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
The $750K is what we've allocated for this year, but you make a good point about the conservative target. We could potentially increase the budget if we see strong performance and can demonstrate clear ROI to leadership. I'd say we're being cautiously optimistic - we want to prove we can efficiently acquire customers at scale before we go bigger. If we hit our targets and the unit economics work out as planned, I think there's definitely room to expand the budget for the following quarter or next year.

AGENT:
Smart approach - prove the model then scale. Your conservative $50 target gives excellent room for optimization and expansion.

Let me check the math on your unit economics: At 65% conversion, each application is worth $1,820 in customer value ($2,800 × 0.65). Targeting $50 means you're operating at 2.7% of maximum spend capacity - very safe territory.

One key question for life insurance: Are you measuring applications immediately, or tracking through to issued policies? The timing matters because insurance underwriting can take weeks, affecting how we optimize campaigns.

What's your primary success metric - total applications submitted, or issued policies after underwriting?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 4 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're primarily focused on applications submitted as our main KPI since that's what we can influence directly through marketing. You're right that underwriting takes time - usually 2-4 weeks depending on the application complexity. We do track through to issued policies for overall business metrics, but for campaign optimization we need that immediate feedback loop of applications. Our underwriting approval rates are pretty consistent, so applications give us a reliable leading indicator of final policy volume.

AGENT:
Excellent - applications as your primary KPI makes perfect sense for optimization speed. With consistent 65% approval rates, you have a reliable leading indicator.

So we have: 
- **Objective**: Premium growth through customer base expansion
- **Primary KPI**: Applications submitted  
- **Target**: 15,000 applications at $50 each = $750,000 budget
- **Efficiency**: Very conservative at 2.7% of maximum affordable spend

Your economics foundation is solid. The $50 per application target is highly achievable for insurance - industry benchmarks typically run $40-80 for life insurance leads, and you're well within that range with strong LTV backing.

Now let's define your target audience. Who is your ideal life insurance prospect - age range, income level, life stage, or other key characteristics?

TURN 5 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our primary target is adults aged 35-60, typically with families and dependents who need financial protection. We focus on middle to upper-middle income households - usually people earning $50K+ who have the disposable income for life insurance premiums. The sweet spot is really people in their peak earning years who are thinking about protecting their family's financial future. We also see good results with new parents and people going through major life changes like getting married or buying a home. Our annuity products tend to skew slightly older in that 45-60 range as people start thinking more seriously about retirement planning.

AGENT:
Perfect audience definition - life stage triggers are key for insurance. Your 35-60 age range with $50K+ income and family responsibilities is well-defined and targetable.

The life event triggers you mentioned (new parents, marriage, home purchases) are particularly valuable because they create urgency and intent. People actively seek financial protection during these transitions.

Let me understand your geographic focus. Are you licensed to sell in all 50 states, or do you have specific states/regions where you're focusing this campaign? Insurance regulations vary significantly by state, which affects both targeting and creative messaging.

Events: step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 6 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're licensed nationwide, so we can target all 50 states. We don't have any geographic restrictions or specific regional focus areas - we're looking to cast a wide net across the US. I know some states have different regulations, but our compliance team handles all that on the backend. From a marketing perspective, we're open to targeting wherever we can find the most efficient customer acquisition, whether that's certain metro areas or broader regional targeting.

AGENT:
Excellent - nationwide licensing gives us maximum flexibility. Since you're open to targeting wherever efficiency is highest, we can optimize geographically based on performance data.

For insurance, some metros typically outperform due to demographics and competition levels. We'll want to monitor cost per application by DMA and shift budget toward your most efficient markets.

Now let's confirm your budget allocation. You have $750,000 total. Do you want to reserve any portion for testing, optimization, or contingencies? Industry practice is typically 10-15% flexibility reserve, which would be $75K-112K set aside, leaving $638K-675K for core campaigns.

What's your thinking on budget flexibility versus deploying the full amount immediately?

Events: benchmark_cited

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 7 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
That makes a lot of sense to hold back some budget for optimization. I think reserving around 10% - so about $75K - would be smart. That gives us flexibility to double down on what's working or pivot if we need to adjust our approach. I'd rather start with $675K for the core campaigns and have that cushion for testing new audiences or channels that show promise. We can always deploy that reserve budget later in the year if everything is performing well and we want to accelerate toward our targets.

AGENT:
Perfect - $675K for core campaigns with $75K flexibility reserve is smart budget management. $675,000 / 15,000 applications = $45 per application for your core campaigns, with the reserve available for scaling winners.

Now let's define your value proposition. Life insurance is a complex purchase decision with emotional and rational elements. What's your primary message to prospects - is it peace of mind for family protection, competitive rates, simplified application process, or something else?

How do you typically position SecureLife against competitors in the market?

Events: calculation_performed, benchmark_cited, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 8 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our main value proposition is really about making life insurance accessible and straightforward. We emphasize peace of mind for families - the emotional side of "protecting what matters most" - but we also compete on our simplified application process. We've streamlined the paperwork and can often approve policies faster than traditional carriers. Our rates are competitive, especially for healthy applicants, and we try to position ourselves as the modern, customer-friendly alternative to the big legacy insurers. I'd say our messaging usually combines the emotional appeal of family protection with the practical benefits of easy application and quick approval.

AGENT:
Excellent positioning - combining emotional family protection with practical ease-of-application differentiates you well from legacy carriers. "Protecting what matters most" with "simplified, faster approval" gives both heart and head reasons to choose SecureLife.

This dual message works perfectly with your life-stage targeting - people going through major transitions want both emotional reassurance and practical solutions that don't add complexity to already busy lives.

Now for channels. With $675K core budget targeting efficiency-driven acquisition, we need platforms that can:
1. Target your 35-60, $50K+ audience precisely
2. Scale to 15,000 applications 
3. Support both emotional and practical messaging
4. Deliver at or below $45 per application

What channels are you currently using, and are there any you definitely want to include or avoid?
