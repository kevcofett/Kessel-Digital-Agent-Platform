# Media Plan Output: Efficiency Shock

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your efficiency target: $750,000 / 15,000 applications = $50 per application. With $2,800 LTV, that's a strong 56:1 return ratio - very achievable for insurance.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 15,000 applications? Are you focused on premium growth, market share expansion, or something else?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect! So 15,000 applications at 65% conversion = 9,750 new policies for premium growth. That's your core business outcome.

Now let's validate if your $50 per application target is realistic. At $2,800 LTV per policyholder, you can afford up to $1,820 per application and still break even ($2,800 × 65% conversion). Your $50 target is extremely conservative - you're targeting just 2.7% of what you could afford.

This suggests either: 1) Very aggressive growth goals, 2) Conservative budgeting, or 3) Opportunity to scale much larger.

Is this $750K budget a constraint, or could you invest more if we prove efficiency at this level?

Turn 3:
Smart approach - prove the model then scale. Your conservative $50 target gives excellent room for optimization and expansion.

Let me check the math on your unit economics: At 65% conversion, each application is worth $1,820 in customer value ($2,800 × 0.65). Targeting $50 means you're operating at 2.7% of maximum spend capacity - very safe territory.

One key question for life insurance: Are you measuring applications immediately, or tracking through to issued policies? The timing matters because insurance underwriting can take weeks, affecting how we optimize campaigns.

What's your primary success metric - total applications submitted, or issued policies after underwriting?

Turn 4:
Excellent - applications as your primary KPI makes perfect sense for optimization speed. With consistent 65% approval rates, you have a reliable leading indicator.

So we have: 
- **Objective**: Premium growth through customer base expansion
- **Primary KPI**: Applications submitted  
- **Target**: 15,000 applications at $50 each = $750,000 budget
- **Efficiency**: Very conservative at 2.7% of maximum affordable spend

Your economics foundation is solid. The $50 per application target is highly achievable for insurance - industry benchmarks typically run $40-80 for life insurance leads, and you're well within that range with strong LTV backing.

Now let's define your target audience. Who is your ideal life insurance prospect - age range, income level, life stage, or other key characteristics?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Perfect audience definition - life stage triggers are key for insurance. Your 35-60 age range with $50K+ income and family responsibilities is well-defined and targetable.

The life event triggers you mentioned (new parents, marriage, home purchases) are particularly valuable because they create urgency and intent. People actively seek financial protection during these transitions.

Let me understand your geographic focus. Are you licensed to sell in all 50 states, or do you have specific states/regions where you're focusing this campaign? Insurance regulations vary significantly by state, which affects both targeting and creative messaging.

Turn 6:
Excellent - nationwide licensing gives us maximum flexibility. Since you're open to targeting wherever efficiency is highest, we can optimize geographically based on performance data.

For insurance, some metros typically outperform due to demographics and competition levels. We'll want to monitor cost per application by DMA and shift budget toward your most efficient markets.

Now let's confirm your budget allocation. You have $750,000 total. Do you want to reserve any portion for testing, optimization, or contingencies? Industry practice is typically 10-15% flexibility reserve, which would be $75K-112K set aside, leaving $638K-675K for core campaigns.

What's your thinking on budget flexibility versus deploying the full amount immediately?

Turn 7:
Perfect - $675K for core campaigns with $75K flexibility reserve is smart budget management. $675,000 / 15,000 applications = $45 per application for your core campaigns, with the reserve available for scaling winners.

Now let's define your value proposition. Life insurance is a complex purchase decision with emotional and rational elements. What's your primary message to prospects - is it peace of mind for family protection, competitive rates, simplified application process, or something else?

How do you typically position SecureLife against competitors in the market?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Excellent positioning - combining emotional family protection with practical ease-of-application differentiates you well from legacy carriers. "Protecting what matters most" with "simplified, faster approval" gives both heart and head reasons to choose SecureLife.

This dual message works perfectly with your life-stage targeting - people going through major transitions want both emotional reassurance and practical solutions that don't add complexity to already busy lives.

Now for channels. With $675K core budget targeting efficiency-driven acquisition, we need platforms that can:
1. Target your 35-60, $50K+ audience precisely
2. Scale to 15,000 applications 
3. Support both emotional and practical messaging
4. Deliver at or below $45 per application

What channels are you currently using, and are there any you definitely want to include or avoid?
