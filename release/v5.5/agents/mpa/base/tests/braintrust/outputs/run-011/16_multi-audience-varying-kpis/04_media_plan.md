# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience with Different KPIs Per Segment

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build this multi-segment media plan with you. This is a sophisticated three-pronged approach that requires different strategies for each funnel stage.

You've outlined three distinct objectives with different success metrics:
- Conquest: Awareness/brand lift for future consideration
- In-Market: Lead generation for active shoppers  
- Loyalty: Retention actions from existing customers

Let me calculate your segment budgets first:
- Conquest: 35% of $4.5M = $1.575M
- In-Market: 45% of $4.5M = $2.025M  
- Loyalty: 20% of $4.5M = $900K

Before we dive into audience and channel strategy, I need to understand your primary success measurement. With three different objectives, which single metric will determine if this overall plan succeeds? Is it total dealership revenue, combined lead volume, or something else that ties all three segments together?

Turn 2:
Perfect - you're absolutely right that forcing a single KPI would mask the performance of each segment. Let's establish separate success frameworks:

**Conquest (2-3 year horizon):** Brand lift, aided/unaided awareness, consideration shift
**In-Market (immediate):** Cost per lead, lead quality, conversion to sale  
**Loyalty (retention cycle):** Service appointment rate, trade-in inquiry rate, customer lifetime value

For planning purposes, let me focus on the In-Market segment first since it has the clearest volume target. With your $2.025M budget for lead generation, what's your target lead volume? Are you looking for total leads across all 12 dealerships, or do you have a cost-per-lead target that would help us calculate the volume?

This will give us a concrete efficiency benchmark to assess if your largest budget allocation is realistic, then we can model the other segments.

Turn 6:
Perfect - three distinct markets with different cost structures and competitive landscapes. Let me break this down:

**Market Structure Analysis:**
- Primary metro (5 dealerships): Higher media costs but better conquest reach
- Secondary metro (4 dealerships): 90 miles away, separate media buy
- Tertiary market (3 dealerships): Smaller scale, likely different channel mix

**Geographic Strategy by Segment:**
- **Conquest:** Broad metro reach in each market (competitor conquest)
- **In-Market:** Tight radius around each dealership location  
- **Loyalty:** Database-driven, no geographic constraints

This creates complexity for budget allocation. Your primary metro with 5 dealerships should get the largest share, but media efficiency might be better in secondary/tertiary markets.

Before we dive into specific market allocation, what's the revenue split across these three markets? Does the primary metro with 5 dealerships generate proportionally more revenue, or are the smaller markets more efficient per location?

This will help determine if we should allocate budget by dealership count, market revenue, or media efficiency.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Got it. Let me model conservatively: at 12% conversion and $2,500 average gross profit.

20,000 leads × 12% = 2,400 sales
2,400 sales × $2,500 = $6M gross profit
ROI: $6M profit ÷ $2.025M investment = 3.0x return

That's still solid for auto retail, giving you room for the actual performance to vary.

The bigger insight is that your $100 CPL target is achievable but will require tight execution. Auto industry benchmarks typically run $80-120 for quality leads, so you're mid-range.

Here's what I'd recommend: let's model the in-market segment at $100 CPL for 20,000 leads, but flag this for validation once campaigns launch. Your conversion tracking will be critical.

Now, for conquest and loyalty segments - these have completely different economics. Conquest is a branding investment with delayed returns, and loyalty should have much higher conversion rates since they're existing customers.

What's your sense of how many existing customers are in your retention database across all 12 dealerships?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Let me check that math: $2.025M ÷ 20,000 leads = $101 average CPL. That aligns with your $100 assumption.

For 12 dealerships, 20,000 leads = roughly 1,667 leads per location annually, or about 139 leads per dealership per month. That's actually quite reasonable for auto retail.

The bigger question is lead-to-sale conversion and unit economics. What percentage of leads typically convert to sales? And what's your average gross profit per vehicle sale? 

If leads convert at 15% (typical for auto), that's 3,000 vehicle sales. If average gross is $3,000 per sale, that's $9M in gross profit from a $2M lead gen investment - which would be excellent ROI.

But I suspect your conversion rates and margins vary significantly by brand tier. Do you have any sense of these numbers, even rough estimates? This will tell us if $100 CPL is conservative or aggressive for your business model.

Turn 5:
Excellent data. Let me model your loyalty segment:

85,000 records × 65% actionable = ~55,000 targetable customers
$900K budget ÷ 55,000 customers = $16.36 cost per customer reached

That's very efficient for retention marketing. With those conversion rates:
- Service: 25-30% of 55,000 = 13,750-16,500 service appointments
- Trade-ins: 8-12% of 55,000 = 4,400-6,600 trade-in inquiries

The loyalty segment economics look strong - existing customers at $16 cost per touch with high conversion rates should deliver excellent ROI.

This gives us a solid foundation:
- **In-Market:** $100 CPL, 20,000 leads, 3x ROI conservative model ✓
- **Loyalty:** $16 per customer, strong conversion rates ✓  
- **Conquest:** $1.575M for awareness/brand lift (hardest to model)

The conquest segment is the wildcard since brand lift measurement is complex and ROI is delayed 2-3 years.

For geography, are all 12 dealerships in the same metro area, or are we dealing with multiple markets? This will significantly impact how we structure the conquest awareness strategy.

Turn 8:
That's the classic efficiency vs. opportunity dilemma. Let me frame the conquest trade-off:

**Primary Metro:** Higher CPMs but larger addressable market of competitor owners
**Secondary/Tertiary:** Better reach efficiency but smaller conquest pools

Here's how I'd approach it: Weight conquest budget toward opportunity size, but cap the primary metro allocation to avoid inefficient spending.

**Proposed Conquest Allocation:**
- Primary: 50% of $1.575M = $787K (vs 60% revenue share)
- Secondary: 35% = $551K (vs 25% revenue share) 
- Tertiary: 15% = $236K (matches revenue share)

This gives secondary markets a conquest boost where efficiency is better, while still investing heavily in the primary metro's larger opportunity.

**Customer Database Split (Loyalty $900K):**
- Primary: 55% = $495K
- Secondary: 30% = $270K  
- Tertiary: 15% = $135K

Before we move to value proposition and channels, what's your competitive landscape like? Are you primarily fighting Toyota/Honda dealers, luxury German brands, or a mix? This affects whether conquest messaging should focus on value, luxury, or something else entirely.

Turn 9:
Exactly - you need conquest messaging that's brand-specific within each market. This adds another layer of complexity to your media plan.

**Conquest Messaging Framework:**
- **Luxury brand:** Service experience, lease incentives vs BMW/Mercedes/Lexus
- **Volume brands:** Reliability, value, incentives vs Toyota/Honda/Nissan/Korean brands

This means your $1.575M conquest budget needs to be split not just by geography, but by brand positioning. Do you have a sense of the revenue split between your luxury brand and volume brands? 

For example, if luxury is 40% of revenue but requires different creative and potentially different channels (luxury buyers consume different media), that affects how we allocate the conquest dollars.

Also, are your volume brands direct competitors to each other, or do they target different customer segments? This determines whether we can use unified volume brand messaging or need separate approaches for each.

Turn 10:
You're right - this is getting complex. Let me map the matrix:

**3 Markets × 3 Brands × 3 Segments = 27 potential combinations**

But we can simplify by recognizing that loyalty is database-driven (geography doesn't matter) and in-market tactics are similar across brands (just different inventory/incentives).

**Simplified Structure:**
- **Loyalty:** 3 brand approaches, database-driven
- **In-Market:** 3 markets × 3 brands = 9 combinations (but similar tactics)
- **Conquest:** 3 markets × 3 brand positions = 9 unique strategies

**Conquest Budget by Brand Position:**
- Luxury: 35% of $1.575M = $551K
- Volume Brand 1: 35% = $551K  
- Volume Brand 2: 30% = $473K

The key insight is that luxury conquest needs different channels (more digital/CTV, less broadcast) while volume brands can share channel strategies with brand-specific creative.

Before we dive into specific channels, what does your current value proposition look like for each brand? Are you leading with price/incentives, service experience, or something else? This determines whether we position you as the value leader, service leader, or selection leader in conquest messaging.

Turn 11:
Perfect - you have three distinct value propositions that align with different customer motivations:

**Luxury:** Service experience, ownership journey (vs price competition)
**Volume Brand 1:** Financial value, incentives (direct price competition) 
**Volume Brand 2:** Reliability, safety, peace of mind (emotional reassurance)

This gives us clear messaging frameworks for conquest, and the volume brands can definitely share channel strategies with different creative executions.

**Value Prop Summary:**
- **Luxury:** "Premium service experience" - loaner vehicles, dedicated bays, white-glove treatment
- **Volume Brand 1:** "More car for your money" - incentives, financing, value comparison  
- **Volume Brand 2:** "Peace of mind ownership" - safety ratings, warranty, reliability heritage

Now let's tackle channels. Given your luxury brand needs different media consumption patterns (more digital/CTV) and your volume brands can share strategies, what channels are you currently using? And which ones have been most effective for each segment?

This will help us allocate your budgets across the right mix of broadcast TV, digital video, search, social, and other channels for maximum impact.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 7:
Smart thinking. Let me model this allocation strategy:

**Revenue-Based Foundation:**
- Primary: 60% = $2.7M
- Secondary: 25% = $1.125M  
- Tertiary: 15% = $675K

**Segment Allocation by Market Logic:**

**In-Market (follows dealership density):**
$2.025M total → Primary: $843K (5/12 share), Secondary: $675K (4/12 share), Tertiary: $507K (3/12 share)

**Loyalty (follows customer database):**
$900K allocated by customer concentration across markets

**Conquest (efficiency-optimized):**
$1.575M total → Shift some budget to secondary/tertiary for better reach efficiency

This creates an interesting challenge: your largest revenue market has the worst media efficiency for conquest, while your most efficient conquest markets generate less revenue.

Do you have a sense of what TV/digital CPMs run in primary vs secondary markets? And roughly what percentage of your 85,000 customer database sits in each market? These numbers will help optimize the conquest and loyalty allocations.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 12:
You've identified the key gaps perfectly. Let me map this against your segments and budgets:

**Current State vs Opportunity:**

**Conquest ($1.575M):**
- Current: Broad TV (inefficient for luxury)
- Opportunity: Luxury → CTV/YouTube/premium display, Volume → broadcast TV + social

**In-Market ($2.025M):** 
- Current: Search + auto sites (solid foundation)
- Opportunity: Add social for younger Volume Brand 1 buyers

**Loyalty ($900K):**
- Current: Email/direct mail 
- Opportunity: CRM retargeting, social remarketing (huge gap given 25-30% service conversion rates)

**Channel Reallocation Strategy:**
- Shift luxury conquest from broadcast TV to digital video/CTV
- Add social to in-market mix for younger demographics  
- Build robust loyalty retargeting with that customer database

Given your $16 cost per loyalty customer and 25-30% service conversion, the loyalty digital expansion should be your highest ROI opportunity.

What's your current digital capability? Do you have pixel tracking, CRM integration, and social advertising experience in-house, or would this require agency support?

Turn 13:
That's a critical strategic decision. Your digital expansion requires sophisticated capabilities your current agency may not have.

**Multi-Agency vs Full-Service Trade-offs:**

**Multi-Agency Approach:**
- Pros: Best-in-class expertise per channel, competitive pricing
- Cons: Coordination complexity across 9 conquest strategies, attribution challenges

**Full-Service Digital-Forward Agency:**
- Pros: Integrated planning, unified measurement, easier coordination
- Cons: May sacrifice traditional media relationships, higher cost

Given your complexity (3 markets × 3 brands × 3 segments), I'd lean toward finding a digital-forward full-service agency that can handle both traditional and advanced digital. The coordination benefits outweigh the specialist trade-offs.

**Immediate Priority:** That loyalty retargeting opportunity. $900K budget, $16 per customer, 25-30% conversion rates - this should be your fastest ROI win while you evaluate agency capabilities.

For measurement, how are you currently tracking attribution across channels? With this multi-channel expansion, you'll need robust measurement to optimize the $4.5M investment. Do you have GA4 configured, and are you tracking phone calls and in-store visits back to digital campaigns?

Turn 14:
Exactly - auto retail attribution is notoriously complex with long consideration periods and multiple touchpoints. You need measurement that can handle 2-3 year conquest cycles alongside immediate in-market conversions.

**Measurement Framework Needed:**
- **Loyalty:** Direct attribution (easiest to measure)
- **In-Market:** Multi-touch attribution with call/visit tracking  
- **Conquest:** Brand lift studies + long-term attribution modeling

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Loyalty retargeting** - Move fast with specialist if needed, those conversion rates demand action
2. **Enhanced call tracking** - Critical for auto retail attribution
3. **Store visit attribution** - Google/Facebook offer this, essential for your model

For testing, given your $4.5M budget and complexity, what's your appetite for test-and-learn approaches? We could start with smaller budget allocations in new channels (CTV for luxury, social for Volume Brand 1) and scale based on performance.

The loyalty retargeting is low-risk/high-reward and should launch immediately. The conquest channel shifts are higher risk but necessary for optimization.

What does your typical planning cycle look like? Are you planning annually, quarterly, or do you have flexibility for ongoing optimization based on performance data?

Turn 15:
Perfect planning flexibility - monthly reviews with quarterly reallocation authority gives you the agility this plan needs.

**Test-and-Learn Budget Allocations:**
- Luxury conquest: 30% to CTV test = $165K (vs traditional TV)
- Volume Brand 1: 20% to social test = $110K (vs current in-market mix)
- Loyalty retargeting: Full $900K immediate deployment

**Call Tracking Recommendations:**
CallRail and CallTrackingMetrics both integrate well with auto CRMs and offer:
- Dynamic number insertion for digital campaigns
- Conversation intelligence for lead quality scoring
- Integration with Google Ads and Facebook for optimization

For store visit attribution, Google's Store Visits and Facebook's Store Traffic work well for auto retail, especially when combined with your CRM data for closed-loop attribution.

**Risk Assessment:** The loyalty retargeting is essentially zero risk with 25-30% conversion rates. The conquest tests are medium risk but capped at test budgets. Your biggest risk is actually doing nothing - competitors are likely already using these channels.

Final question: What's your timeline for implementation? Can we get loyalty retargeting live within 30 days, or are there internal approval processes that might slow deployment?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 16:
Absolutely - phased rollout is the smart approach given your constraints and priorities.

**Phased Implementation Timeline:**

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Loyalty Retargeting**
- Week 1: Approval + specialist agency selection
- Week 2: Database export + pixel implementation  
- Week 3: Campaign setup + audience creation
- Week 4: Launch + initial optimization

**Phase 2 (Weeks 5-12): Conquest Tests + Call Tracking**
- CallRail implementation
- Luxury CTV test ($165K)
- Volume Brand 1 social test ($110K)

**Phase 3 (Weeks 13-16): Analysis + Scale**
- Performance review across all tests
- Budget reallocation based on results
- Full agency strategy decision

**Quick Loyalty Launch Reality Check:**
A good digital specialist can get Facebook/Google remarketing live in 2-3 weeks if your database is clean and pixels are prioritized. The $16 cost per customer with 25-30% conversion makes this worth fast-tracking.

Your biggest implementation risk is database quality - do you have confidence in email match rates and data cleanliness across those 85,000 records? Poor match rates could hurt initial performance and skew results.

This plan positions you to see loyalty ROI within 30 days while building toward the broader strategic shifts. Sound like the right approach?

Turn 17:
Perfect - you've got a clear action plan that balances speed with risk management.

**Database Reality Check:**
60-70% match rates = ~50,000-60,000 targetable customers
$900K ÷ 55,000 customers = $16.36 per customer (still excellent)
Even with data quality issues, those economics work.

**Immediate Action Items:**
1. Get dealer principal approval (Week 1)
2. Database audit + cleanup (parallel process)
3. Digital specialist vetting (focus on auto retail experience)
4. Pixel implementation prep

The beauty of this approach is that loyalty success creates internal momentum for the bigger strategic shifts. Once you're showing 25-30% service conversion rates from a $16 investment, the conquest channel tests become much easier to approve.

**Success Metrics Summary:**
- Loyalty: Service appointments + trade-in inquiries (immediate ROI)
- Conquest Tests: Brand lift + efficiency vs traditional channels
- Overall: Path to optimizing your full $4.5M investment

You've built a sophisticated multi-segment strategy that addresses your immediate opportunities while positioning for long-term optimization. The phased approach gives you wins to build on while managing complexity. This should deliver strong results across all three objectives.
