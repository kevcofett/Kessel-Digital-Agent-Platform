# Media Plan Output: Channel Mix Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You mentioned awareness goals - what specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with this launch? Are you looking to drive trial purchases, build brand recognition for future sales, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect, trial purchases as your primary objective with brand support. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success as a number.

You mentioned reaching 2 million households for awareness, but for the trial purchase objective - what's your specific target? Are you aiming for a certain number of first-time customers, trial units sold, or revenue from new customers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using typical organic food margins of 45-50% based on industry benchmarks for premium positioning. You can refine this anytime as finance finalizes the numbers.

At $13.33 average order and 47.5% margin, that's $6.33 profit per trial order. Since you're spending $20 to acquire each customer, you need strong repeat purchase to reach profitability - which aligns with your LTV strategy.

For context: successful organic food brands typically see 25-35% of trial customers make a second purchase within 90 days. If 30% of your trial customers spend another $13, that's an additional $4 profit per acquired customer, bringing you closer to breakeven on acquisition spend.

This confirms your $20 efficiency target is achievable but requires excellent retention execution.

Moving on, who exactly are these health-conscious families you're targeting?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - 150,000 first-time customers and $2M in new customer revenue. Let me run the efficiency math:

$3M budget / 150,000 customers = $20 per customer acquisition

That's quite efficient for organic food, where customer acquisition costs typically run $25-40. At $2M revenue from 150K customers, that's $13.33 average order value, which seems realistic for a snack trial.

Your 7.5% trial rate from reach is ambitious but achievable with strong targeting - organic snack trials typically convert 3-8% depending on audience precision.

Before we dive into your audience strategy, is this $20 customer acquisition cost realistic given your product margins? Can you profitably acquire customers at that efficiency?

Turn 5:
Perfect audience foundation. Let me dig deeper into the health-conscious behaviors that will help us target efficiently.

Beyond organic preference, what specific behaviors or interests define your ideal customers? For example: Do they shop at Whole Foods vs mainstream grocery? Follow wellness influencers? Use fitness apps? Buy other premium food brands? Have dietary restrictions?

These behavioral signals will be crucial for precise targeting across channels and avoiding waste in that 2 million household reach goal.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Excellent targeting signals. Your audience profile is:

**Demographics:** Ages 25-54, HHI $75K+, families with children
**Behavioral:** Shop Whole Foods + mainstream grocery, follow wellness influencers/clean eating content, use fitness apps, practice yoga/running
**Brand Affinity:** Annie's, Kind bars, Applegate (premium natural brands)
**Motivations:** Food sensitivities, avoiding artificial ingredients, brand safety focus

This gives us strong targeting precision across digital and traditional channels. The multi-retailer shopping pattern is smart - captures the mainstream organic trend.

Now for geography: You mentioned targeting nationally. Are there specific regions where organic snack consumption is stronger, or do you want truly national coverage? For example, West Coast and Northeast typically over-index for organic foods.

Turn 7:
Smart regional strategy. Let me structure this geographically with population and target audience sizing:

**GEOGRAPHY ALLOCATION**

| Region | Total Population | Target Audience Size | Target Audience % | Planned Spend | Spend Per Target |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------|------------------|
| West Coast & Northeast | 135M | 1.2M households | 0.89% | $1.2M (40%) | $1,000 |
| South & Midwest | 195M | 800K households | 0.41% | $1.8M (60%) | $2,250 |
| **TOTAL** | **330M** | **2M households** | **0.61%** | **$3M** | **$1,500** |

This shows your targeting will be much more efficient in high-indexing markets - you're paying $1,000 per target household on the coasts vs $2,250 in emerging markets. The 0.61% national targeting rate is realistic for premium organic families.

The geographic weighting makes strategic sense: invest efficiently where audience density is highest while maintaining national presence.

Now let's talk budget allocation beyond geography. How do you want to split your $3M between customer acquisition and brand building activities?

Turn 8:
Perfect allocation aligning with your 70/30 strategy:

**BUDGET ALLOCATION**
- **Customer Acquisition:** $2.1M for 150,000 customers = $14 per customer
- **Brand Building:** $900K for awareness and trust building

This is excellent news for efficiency. At $14 acquisition cost vs your original $20 target, you have $6 per customer cushion for:
- Geographic market testing ($2.1M allows testing spend efficiency across regions)
- Creative testing and optimization
- Platform learning phases

The $900K brand investment will support trial conversion by building trust - crucial for premium organic where parents need confidence before trying new snacks for their families.

Your acquisition efficiency of $14 per customer is very strong for organic food. Industry benchmarks typically run $18-35 for premium natural brands.

What's your key value proposition that will drive both trial and brand preference? What makes PureLife Organics snacks different from Kind, Annie's, and other established players?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 10:
Perfect - let's build your channel strategy from the ground up. With your audience, budget, and efficiency targets, here's my recommended channel mix:

**ACQUISITION CHANNELS ($2.1M)**
- **Meta (Facebook/Instagram): $840K (40%)** - Excellent for wellness/parenting targeting, visual snack content
- **Google Search: $525K (25%)** - Captures "healthy snacks for kids" intent
- **Connected TV: $420K (20%)** - Efficient national reach for families, premium brand building
- **Influencer/Creator: $315K (15%)** - Wellness influencers your audience follows

**BRAND BUILDING ($900K)**
- **YouTube: $450K (50%)** - Video storytelling for farm transparency, kid taste tests
- **Podcast Sponsorships: $270K (30%)** - Parenting/wellness shows, trusted voice
- **PR/Sampling: $180K (20%)** - Trial generation, earned media

This mix efficiently reaches your 2M households while maintaining your $14 acquisition cost. Meta and Google provide precision targeting, CTV delivers scale, and influencers add authenticity.

Does this channel approach align with how you envision reaching health-conscious families?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Excellent value proposition - you've identified real competitive advantages:

**CORE DIFFERENTIATORS:**
- USDA Organic + zero artificial preservatives (including "natural" ones)
- Sprouted grain base for digestibility/nutrition
- Full supply chain transparency to farm level
- Kid-approved taste with clean ingredients

This is compelling for health-conscious parents who want both clean AND appealing snacks. The sprouted grain angle is particularly strong - differentiates from Kind's nuts/seeds and Annie's traditional approach.

**MESSAGING HIERARCHY:**
1. **Trial Driver:** "Clean snacks kids actually love" (taste + clean)
2. **Trust Builder:** Farm-to-package transparency 
3. **Category Leadership:** Beyond organic - zero artificial anything

The "kids actually want to eat" positioning directly addresses the #1 parent pain point in healthy snacking.

Now we're ready for channel strategy. With your $2.1M acquisition budget, $900K brand budget, health-conscious family targeting, and national-but-weighted geography - what channels are you currently considering or have experience with?

Turn 13:
Excellent - you understand the complex customer journey reality. Here are my CPG-focused attribution platform recommendations:

**ATTRIBUTION PLATFORMS FOR CPG**
- **Triple Whale ($15K annually):** Strong for DTC brands, integrates Meta/Google/email
- **Northbeam ($25K annually):** More sophisticated, handles CTV + digital attribution well
- **Rockerbox ($30K annually):** Enterprise-grade, excellent for multi-channel CPG campaigns

**CTV MEASUREMENT PARTNERS**
- **iSpot.tv:** Household-level CTV attribution, integrates with digital platforms
- **VideoAmp:** Cross-screen measurement, strong CPG client base
- **TVSquared:** Real-time TV attribution with digital integration

**IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE**
- Week 1-2: Platform selection and contracting
- Week 3-4: Technical integration and UTM framework setup  
- Week 5-6: Testing and validation before campaign launch
- Week 7+: Campaign launch with full attribution tracking

Your $50K measurement budget breaks down to roughly $35K for annual platform fees plus $15K for setup/integration support.

Now let's talk testing strategy. With 7 channels and $3M budget, what aspects of the campaign do you want to test first to optimize performance?

Turn 14:
Smart testing priorities - creative messaging will impact all channels, and audience precision affects your core $1.365M Meta/Google spend.

**CREATIVE MESSAGE TESTING ($150K test budget)**
- **Message A:** "Clean snacks kids actually love" (taste-first positioning)
- **Message B:** "Beyond organic - zero artificial anything" (ingredient-first positioning)
- **Creative Format Tests:** Kids eating vs. ingredient transparency vs. product beauty shots

**AUDIENCE TARGETING STRATEGY**
Start narrow, then expand. Here's why:

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Narrow Targeting**
- High-intent behaviors: Whole Foods shoppers, wellness influencer followers, specific brand purchasers
- Benefit: Higher conversion rates, cleaner attribution data, efficient learning

**Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): Controlled Expansion**  
- Lookalike audiences based on Phase 1 converters
- Interest expansion: Broader organic/healthy living categories
- Benefit: Scale while maintaining efficiency

**TESTING BUDGET ALLOCATION**
- Creative testing: $100K across Meta/Google (split 50/50)
- Audience testing: $50K for narrow vs. broad comparison

At narrow targeting, expect $12-16 acquisition cost. Broad targeting typically runs $18-25 but reaches more households.

What's your risk tolerance for testing broader audiences if narrow targeting limits your reach potential?

Turn 15:
Perfect risk management approach. Let me model this narrow-to-broad strategy:

**VOLUME PROJECTION**
- Narrow targeting: 100,000 customers at $14 cost = $1.4M spend (67% of target)
- Broad expansion: 50,000 customers at $22 cost = $1.1M spend (33% of target)
- **Total: 150,000 customers at $16.67 blended cost**

This keeps you well below your original $20 target while achieving full volume.

**RISK MITIGATION PLAN**
- Week 4 checkpoint: If narrow delivers <60% of target, accelerate broad testing
- Week 8 checkpoint: If broad exceeds $25 cost, cap at narrow volume and reallocate budget to brand building
- Efficiency guardrail: Stop broad expansion if blended cost exceeds $18

**FINAL RISK ASSESSMENT**
Your biggest risks are:
1. **Creative fatigue** in narrow audiences (requires 2-3 creative variants ready)
2. **CTV measurement lag** (4-6 week attribution delay)
3. **Seasonal competition** (back-to-school snack category surge)

The measurement infrastructure and testing approach we've built addresses these systematically.

You now have a complete media plan. Ready to move forward, or any final concerns about execution?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Excellent questions! Let me break down the podcast and sampling strategy:

**PODCAST MIX ($270K)**
- **Parenting Shows (60% = $162K):** Mom-focused like "The Longest Shortest Time," "Unruffled" - trusted voices on family decisions
- **Wellness/Nutrition (40% = $108K):** Shows like "The Model Health Show," "Wellness Mama" - ingredient education focus

Parenting pods work better for trial conversion since they address daily feeding struggles. Wellness pods build ingredient credibility.

**PR/SAMPLING STRATEGY ($180K)**
- **In-Store Demos (50% = $90K):** Whole Foods, Target, high-traffic weekend sampling
- **Digital Sampling (30% = $54K):** Platforms like Sampler, PINCHme for targeted household delivery
- **Influencer Seeding (20% = $36K):** Product to wellness creators for authentic content

In-store demos are crucial - parents need to see kids actually enjoying the taste. Digital sampling reaches precise households in your target geography efficiently.

How do you measure success across these channels? Do you have attribution tracking set up, or do we need to build that measurement framework?

Turn 12:
Critical gap to address - with 7 channels driving trial, you need robust attribution. Here's my recommended measurement framework:

**PRIMARY TRACKING METHODS**
- **UTM Parameters:** Unique codes for each channel/campaign to track direct conversions
- **Promo Codes:** Channel-specific codes for podcasts, influencers, sampling
- **Post-Purchase Surveys:** "How did you first hear about us?" - captures upper funnel influence
- **Google Analytics 4 Enhanced Ecommerce:** Track full customer journey with proper setup

**ATTRIBUTION MODELING**
- **First-Touch Attribution:** Credit the channel that introduced the customer
- **Last-Touch Attribution:** Credit the channel that drove final purchase  
- **Survey-Based Attribution:** Weight based on customer-reported influence

**CHANNEL-SPECIFIC TRACKING**
- Meta/Google: Platform pixels + UTMs
- CTV: Household-level measurement via partners like iSpot, VideoAmp
- Podcasts: Host-read promo codes + vanity URLs
- Influencers: Unique discount codes + affiliate links

**BUDGET RECOMMENDATION:** Allocate $50K from your $3M budget for measurement infrastructure and third-party attribution tools.

Do you have internal analytics capabilities, or should we factor in external measurement partners for the more complex attribution?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 16:
Excellent! You've built a comprehensive plan that balances efficiency with volume goals. Here's your complete framework:

**CAMPAIGN SUMMARY**
- **Target:** 150,000 first-time customers at $16.67 blended acquisition cost
- **Budget:** $3M total ($2.1M acquisition, $900K brand building)
- **Strategy:** Narrow-to-broad targeting with systematic testing and measurement

**KEY SUCCESS FACTORS**
1. **Measurement first** - Northbeam + CTV attribution before launch
2. **Creative testing** - Message variants ready for audience fatigue
3. **Checkpoint discipline** - Week 4 and 8 reviews with clear guardrails
4. **Geographic efficiency** - Leverage West Coast/Northeast density

You're well-positioned for success. The efficiency cushion gives you room to optimize, and the measurement framework ensures you'll learn what drives real trial conversion vs. just attributed conversions.

Your leadership presentation should emphasize the conservative efficiency targets and systematic risk management - you've built a plan that can adapt while protecting the business outcome.
