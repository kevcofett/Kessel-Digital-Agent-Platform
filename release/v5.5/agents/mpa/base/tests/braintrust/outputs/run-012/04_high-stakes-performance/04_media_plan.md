# Media Plan Output: High-Stakes Performance Campaign

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business outcome. You mentioned acquiring 50,000 new merchants - is merchant acquisition your primary objective, or are you also focused on transaction volume, revenue growth, or market expansion alongside the merchant count?

Turn 2:
Perfect, that's a clear growth-focused objective. Now let me work out the economics to see if your targets are realistic.

$2M budget ÷ 50,000 merchants = $40 per merchant acquisition cost (CAC). With your $850 LTV, that's a 21:1 LTV:CAC ratio, which is excellent for fintech - most payment platforms see 8-15:1 ratios.

Your $40 CAC target is quite efficient. Based on fintech benchmarks, merchant acquisition typically runs $60-150 depending on merchant size and vertical. At $40, you're targeting the aggressive end.

If efficiency runs 25% higher to $50 per merchant, you'd acquire 40,000 merchants instead of 50,000. If you achieve $35 efficiency, you could reach 57,000 merchants.

For your primary KPI measuring success - would you track total new merchants acquired, or do you want a blended metric that includes the transaction volume component you mentioned?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Smart adjustment. Let me recalculate with your $50 CAC target:

$2M budget ÷ $50 per merchant = 40,000 core target, with 50,000 as stretch if we hit the aggressive $40 efficiency. That 25% buffer gives you realistic planning while maintaining upside potential.

Your blended KPI makes sense for sustainable growth. For the bonus structure, if we assume 30-40% of new merchants typically hit $15K+ monthly processing (based on fintech onboarding patterns), that could add 12,000-16,000 "quality merchant bonuses" to your 40,000 base target.

Quick clarification on the quality threshold: Is $15K monthly processing a good benchmark for what you consider a valuable merchant, or should we adjust that number based on your average merchant processing volumes?

Once we nail down that metric, we'll move into audience definition - understanding exactly which types of merchants we need to reach to hit both the volume and quality targets.

Turn 4:
Perfect - 40,000 merchants with 12,000-16,000 quality bonuses gives you solid ARR foundation. Now let's define your target merchants to maximize both volume and quality acquisition.

Since you're targeting that $10K-100K monthly processing sweet spot, I need to understand your ideal merchant profile better. What business types or verticals currently make up your highest-value merchants - are you seeing success with e-commerce, professional services, retail, or other specific sectors?

Understanding your current winners will help us identify the audience signals that predict both quick onboarding and strong transaction velocity.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Excellent data. Your strongest verticals show clear patterns - businesses with recurring revenue models (SaaS, consulting), predictable payment cycles (B2B services), and digital-forward operations (e-commerce, hybrid retail).

Let me map the audience signals we'll need:

**Primary Targets:**
- E-commerce: $500K-5M annual revenue, existing payment processing
- Professional services: 10-100 employees, B2B billing cycles
- B2B suppliers: Established wholesale/distribution operations
- Hybrid retail: Physical + online presence

**Behavioral Signals:**
- Currently using payment processors (Stripe, Square competitors)
- Business banking relationships
- Digital marketing spend (indicates growth mindset)
- Recent business expansion signals

Before we get more granular on demographics and firmographics, what geographic markets are you currently strong in versus where you want to expand? You mentioned moving beyond major metros - are you thinking tier-2 cities, specific regions, or broader national coverage?

Turn 6:
Smart geographic strategy - tier-2 expansion should give you better CAC efficiency while building market presence before competitors saturate those areas.

Let me structure your geography plan. I'll model your current strongholds plus the tier-2 expansion markets:

**Current Markets (60% of budget focus):**
- NYC, LA, Chicago, SF Bay Area, Atlanta, Austin
- Higher merchant density, established brand awareness

**Tier-2 Expansion (40% of budget focus):**
- Nashville, Denver, Phoenix, Charlotte
- Lower competition, potentially better conversion rates

For audience sizing in these markets, I need one key data point: What's your typical geographic penetration rate? For example, in your strongest current market, what percentage of eligible merchants (matching your revenue/vertical criteria) have you captured? This helps me model realistic market opportunity in the tier-2 cities.

Turn 7:
Those estimates are perfect for modeling - 3-5% in major metros and 8-10% in focused markets like Austin gives me solid benchmarks.

Let me calculate the opportunity. With your penetration rates, tier-2 cities should have massive headroom. If you're at 3-5% in saturated metros, tier-2 markets probably sit at <1% penetration, meaning 10-20x more opportunity per market.

Your 60/40 budget split works well: $1.2M for current markets (defending and growing from your 3-5% base) and $800K for tier-2 expansion (capturing early market share before competition arrives).

I'll model realistic merchant targets by market once we have budget allocation locked. For now, let's move to budget planning. 

Your $2M total is clear, but how do you want to split between pure acquisition spend versus retention/expansion campaigns for existing merchants? Most fintech platforms allocate 80-90% to acquisition with 10-20% for growth campaigns. What ratio makes sense for your growth stage?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Your 85/15 split is strategically sound - more aggressive than the 80/20 industry standard but with smart reasoning. The 15% retention investment should pay dividends by improving that 30-40% rate of merchants hitting your $15K quality threshold.

Let me update the economics:

**Acquisition Budget:** $1.7M ÷ $50 CAC = 34,000 core merchants
**Quality Merchant Projection:** 10,200-13,600 hitting $15K+ processing
**Retention Budget:** $300K for early merchant success campaigns

This puts you at 34,000 new merchants versus your 40,000 target. The gap suggests we need either:
- Higher acquisition efficiency (closer to that $40 CAC)
- Slight budget reallocation toward acquisition
- Or accept 34,000 as realistic target given retention investment

The retention spend should improve merchant quality rates and reduce churn, which strengthens long-term unit economics even if it slightly reduces initial volume.

How does hitting 34,000 high-quality merchants versus 40,000 total merchants align with your ARR targets? The quality focus might actually deliver better revenue outcomes.

Turn 9:
Excellent strategic thinking. You're prioritizing sustainable growth over vanity metrics - 34,000 quality merchants with improved retention will likely generate more ARR than 40,000 mixed-quality merchants.

Updated model:
**Target:** 34,000 new merchants at $50 CAC
**Quality projection:** 15,300-17,000 hitting $15K+ processing (45-50% rate vs. 30-40% baseline)
**Budget:** $1.7M acquisition + $300K retention/growth

This approach builds a stronger foundation. Those 15,300-17,000 quality merchants become your growth engine for referrals and expansion revenue.

Now let's develop your value proposition. For your target merchants (e-commerce, professional services, B2B suppliers), what's your primary competitive advantage? Is it better rates, superior technology, faster payouts, better customer service, or something else that drives merchants to switch from their current processor?

Understanding your strongest differentiator will shape how we position campaigns across those tier-1 and tier-2 markets.

Turn 10:
Perfect - you've identified three strong value props that directly address mid-market pain points:

**Primary Value Props:**
1. **Cash Flow Control:** Same-day payouts + unified dashboard for real-time visibility
2. **Seamless Integration:** API-first platform that works with existing business systems  
3. **Dedicated Support:** Account managers at $50K+ monthly (vs. competitors at much higher thresholds)

These differentiate perfectly against Stripe (too developer-focused) and Square (too small-business-focused) for your mid-market sweet spot.

The cash flow messaging should be especially powerful for B2B suppliers managing inventory cycles, while the integration story resonates with e-commerce and SaaS companies who need technical sophistication without complexity.

For tier-2 markets, that dedicated support angle is brilliant - businesses in Nashville or Charlotte aren't expecting fintech-level service quality, so you can create real competitive moats.

Now let's move to channels. With your $1.7M acquisition budget, clear value props, and defined audiences across tier-1 and tier-2 markets, which channels are you currently using, and where do you think we should focus the media mix?
