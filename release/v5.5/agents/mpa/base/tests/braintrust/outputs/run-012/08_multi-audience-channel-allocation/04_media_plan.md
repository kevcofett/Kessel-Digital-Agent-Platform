# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience with Segment-Specific Channels

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build this segmented media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've provided excellent segment detail - I can see this requires distinct channel strategies. Let me start with outcomes to ensure our plan delivers the right business results.

With your $5M budget targeting 50,000 enrollments, that implies $100 per enrollment. For online education, typical acquisition costs run $80-150, so you're positioned well in that range.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 50,000 enrollments? Is this about revenue growth, market share expansion, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect - 40% growth targeting revenue expansion and market penetration, especially in corporate L&D. You're right about segment CAC variation - corporate typically runs 2-3x higher due to longer cycles and ABM requirements.

Let me reforecast with segment considerations: $5M / 50,000 = $100 blended CAC. For online education segments:
- Career Changers: $80-120 typical (research-heavy but self-directed)
- College-Age: $60-100 typical (volume-driven, faster decisions) 
- Corporate L&D: $200-400 typical (longer cycles, multiple stakeholders)

If Corporate L&D runs $300 and represents 20% of volume (10,000 enrollments), that's $3M. Remaining $2M for 40,000 enrollments = $50 CAC for the other segments - that's aggressive.

How do you want to split the 50,000 enrollments across your three segments?

Turn 4:
Perfect - let me reforecast with your aggressive efficiency targets:

**Revised Budget Model:**
- Corporate L&D: 12,500 × $250 = $3.125M
- College-Age: 17,500 × $65 = $1.138M  
- Career Changers: 20,000 × $85 = $1.7M
- **Total: $5.963M**

Still $963K over budget. We need another 16% efficiency improvement across segments.

**Revenue-Optimized Approach:**
If corporate generates 60-70% of revenue at 25% of volume, those 12,500 enrollments are your profit engine. We should protect that volume and find efficiency elsewhere.

**Options:**
1. Reduce career changer volume to 17,000 (saves $255K)
2. Hit $60 CAC on college-age (saves $87.5K) 
3. Combination approach

Given revenue is your primary KPI and corporate L&D drives most revenue, which segment volume are you most flexible on?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - let me model that split:

**Volume Allocation:**
- Career Changers: 20,000 enrollments (40%)
- College-Age: 17,500 enrollments (35%) 
- Corporate L&D: 12,500 enrollments (25%)

**Budget Implications at Your CAC Estimates:**
- Corporate L&D: 12,500 × $300 = $3.75M
- College-Age: 17,500 × $75 = $1.31M
- Career Changers: 20,000 × $95 = $1.9M
- **Total: $6.96M**

This exceeds your $5M budget by $1.96M. Given corporate's 3-4x higher LTV, the math may still work, but we need to reconcile the budget constraint.

Options: Reduce corporate volume, accept higher efficiency requirements across segments, or increase budget allocation.

What's your primary KPI for measuring campaign success - total enrollments, revenue, or something else?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Excellent - let me model your revenue-optimized allocation:

**Final Volume & Budget Model:**
- Corporate L&D: 12,500 × $250 = $3.125M (62.5% of budget)
- Career Changers: 18,500 × $85 = $1.573M (31.5% of budget)  
- College-Age: 15,000 × $60 = $900K (18% of budget)
- **Total: 46,000 enrollments at $5.598M**

This protects your highest-value corporate segment while requiring strong efficiency on college-age at $60 CAC - that's aggressive but achievable with TikTok/Instagram volume.

You've optimized for revenue over pure enrollment volume, which makes strategic sense given the LTV differences.

**Step 1 Complete:** Revenue growth objective, 46,000 total enrollments across three segments, $5.6M budget.

Ready to move to Step 2 Economics? I want to validate whether these efficiency targets are realistic for each segment's typical conversion behavior.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Got it - I'll model using reasonable assumptions for online education segments and you can refine anytime.

**Segment Conversion & Economics Analysis:**

**Corporate L&D ($250 CAC target):**
- Typical online ed B2B: 2-4% landing page conversion, 6-month sales cycles
- Your target requires ~4% efficiency - aggressive but achievable with ABM approach
- Challenge: Multiple stakeholders, budget approval processes
- Opportunity: High intent when they engage, sticky once enrolled

**Career Changers ($85 CAC target):**
- Typical: 3-8% conversion, 2-4 week consideration
- Your target is middle-range - realistic with strong nurture sequences
- Advantage: Self-directed, research-driven, clear pain points

**College-Age ($60 CAC target):**
- Typical: 5-12% conversion, impulsive decisions
- Your target requires top 25% efficiency - doable with creative volume and social proof
- Risk: High competition, fickle audience

Based on your growth trajectory, do you have rough estimates of average course values by segment to validate the LTV ratios?

Turn 7:
Perfect - those course values validate your CAC strategy:

**LTV:CAC Analysis by Segment:**
- Corporate L&D: $4,000 avg / $250 CAC = 16:1 ratio
- Career Changers: $1,500 avg / $85 CAC = 17.6:1 ratio  
- College-Age: $750 avg / $60 CAC = 12.5:1 ratio

All segments show healthy 12-18x LTV:CAC ratios, well above the 3:1 minimum threshold for sustainable growth. Corporate's 16:1 ratio justifies the aggressive $250 efficiency target - even if you hit $300 actual CAC, you're still at 13:1.

**Revenue Projection:**
- Corporate: 12,500 × $4,000 = $50M (78% of revenue)
- Career Changers: 18,500 × $1,500 = $27.75M (43% of revenue)  
- College-Age: 15,000 × $750 = $11.25M (17% of revenue)
- **Total Revenue: ~$89M**

Your economics are solid. The efficiency targets require execution discipline but the unit economics support aggressive growth.

**Step 2 Complete.** Ready to move to Step 3 - Audience definition? I want to dig deeper into the behavioral and psychographic signals for each segment.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
Excellent - let's build precise behavioral targeting for each segment's conversion signals.

**Career Changers (18,500 target) - Intent Signal Mapping:**

**High-Intent Behaviors:**
- Downloaded career transition guides/salary reports in past 30 days
- Engaged with "upskilling" or "career change" content on LinkedIn
- Visited competitor course pages or online learning platforms
- Searched terms: "career change at 35," "learn new skills," "[skill] certification"
- Listened to career/professional development podcasts (Career Change, Masters in Business)

**Conversion Triggers:**
- Job market research behavior (salary sites, job boards)
- Professional networking activity spikes
- Industry conference/webinar attendance
- Skills assessment tool usage

**Audience Sizing Question:** In your tech hub geos (SF, Seattle, Austin, NYC, Boston, Denver), what's your estimate of this addressable audience size? This affects our channel efficiency assumptions.

Turn 9:
Perfect - 200-300K high-intent audience for 18,500 targets means you need 6-9% market penetration. That's ambitious but achievable with sustained presence.

**Career Changer Targeting Refinement:**
- Always-on: 60% budget for consistent LinkedIn/podcast reach
- Surge: 40% budget for high-intent moments (Q1 planning season, post-earnings layoffs)
- Retargeting pool: ~50K monthly site visitors based on your traffic

**College-Age Segment (15,000 target) - Intent Signal Deep Dive:**

**High-Intent Behaviors:**
- Researching "college alternatives" or "skip college" content
- Following career/entrepreneurship creators on TikTok/Instagram
- Engaging with "day in my life" content from young professionals
- Searching: "online courses worth it," "learn skills without college," "remote jobs no degree"

**Conversion Triggers:**
- College application stress periods (fall/spring)
- Gap year planning searches
- Student loan/debt content engagement

What's your read on the college-age addressable audience size nationally? And do you see seasonal patterns in their enrollment behavior?

Turn 10:
Excellent seasonal intelligence - those spring/late summer spikes align perfectly with college decision stress points. December "college isn't working" moment is brilliant targeting.

**College-Age Refined Strategy:**
- Spring surge (March-May): 35% of annual budget during college decision season
- Late summer (July-August): 25% during gap year planning  
- December pivot: 20% targeting college dropout consideration
- Always-on: 20% for consistent creator partnership and organic discovery

**Corporate L&D Segment (12,500 target) - ABM Intent Mapping:**

**High-Intent Account Signals:**
- HR/L&D job postings indicating skills gap initiatives
- Company earnings calls mentioning "workforce development" or "upskilling"
- LinkedIn activity from L&D decision-makers engaging with training content
- Trade publication consumption (Chief Learning Officer, Training Magazine)
- Conference attendance at HR/L&D events (ATD, Cornerstone OnDemand)

**Decision-Maker Behaviors:**
- Researching "employee retention through training"
- Downloading L&D ROI whitepapers
- Engaging with case study content from similar companies

What's your typical corporate deal size and how many decision-makers are usually involved in the buying process?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 11:
Perfect - $25K-200K deals with 4-8 month cycles validates your $250 CAC target. At 12,500 enrollments averaging ~$4K course value, you're looking at a mix of smaller company bulk purchases and enterprise individual certifications.

**Corporate L&D ABM Strategy Refinement:**
- Q4 budget planning surge: 40% of annual corporate budget (Sept-Nov)
- Always-on account warming: 35% for consistent executive engagement
- Expansion/renewal: 25% targeting existing relationships for upsells

**Multi-stakeholder targeting approach:**
- L&D Directors: Primary nurture track with ROI case studies
- HR Leadership: Budget justification content, retention metrics
- Department Heads: Skills gap analysis, productivity content  
- IT Stakeholders: Integration guides, security documentation

**Step 3 Complete** - All three segments have detailed behavioral targeting and audience sizing.

Ready for Step 4 - Geography? I want to validate your tech hub focus for career changers and explore whether corporate L&D should expand beyond those markets given the remote work shift.
