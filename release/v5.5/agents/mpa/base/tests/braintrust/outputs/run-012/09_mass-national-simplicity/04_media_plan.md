# Media Plan Output: Mass National Campaign - Simplicity Test

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

For your FreshBite Snacks launch, I want to make sure we define success clearly. You mentioned brand awareness as the objective and brand lift studies for measurement. 

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with this awareness campaign? For example, are you aiming to drive trial purchases, increase consideration for future purchases, or establish market presence before a retail rollout?

Turn 2:
Perfect! So your objective is driving trial purchases and building consideration for the new snack line. 

For measurement, you mentioned brand lift studies. What specific number will tell you this campaign succeeded? For example, are you targeting a specific percentage increase in brand awareness, aided recall, purchase intent, or trial rate among your target audience?

Turn 4:
Absolutely! Narrowing to adults 25-44 with $50k+ household income is much more efficient. That reduces your target from ~150 million to roughly 45-50 million people.

Let me recalculate: $8M budget targeting 45-50 million people projects to $160-180 per thousand people, which allows for much stronger frequency. At typical brand campaign efficiency of $2-4 per person reached effectively, you could now reach 2-4 million people with meaningful frequency (4-6 exposures), representing 4-9% of your target audience.

However, to achieve 15% awareness lift, you typically need to reach 60-70% of your target audience. That would require reaching 27-35 million people from your 45-50 million target segment. At $2-4 per person reached, that would need $54-140 million.

Your $8M budget appears to be about 1/7th to 1/17th of what's typically required for broad awareness goals. Are you open to adjusting the awareness target to something more achievable with $8M, or do you have additional budget flexibility?

Turn 5:
Smart pivot! With $8M, let's model what's actually achievable.

For strong brand awareness building, you'd want to reach 40-60% of your target audience with 4-6 exposures. Focusing on key markets makes this much more realistic.

$8M could effectively cover roughly 10-15 major DMAs (like top metros: NYC, LA, Chicago, Dallas, etc.) representing about 35-40% of US adults 25-44, $50k+. In these markets, you could achieve:
- 50-60% reach with 4-5 frequency
- Realistic awareness lift: 8-12% 
- Purchase intent lift: 6-8%
- Aided recall: 12-15%

This approach also gives you geographic concentration that supports retail velocity in key markets, then you can expand with proof of concept.

Which makes more sense: targeting 10-15 top DMAs for strong impact, or would you prefer broader but lighter national coverage?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent! So success means 15% brand awareness lift, 10% purchase intent lift, and 20% aided recall. With your $8M budget targeting adults 18-54 nationally, let me work out the efficiency implications.

For brand campaigns targeting 150+ million adults, typical costs run $2-4 per person reached effectively (3+ frequency). Your $8M budget projects to reaching roughly 2-4 million people at that frequency, or broader reach at lower frequency.

However, achieving 15% awareness lift across such a broad audience typically requires significant reach and frequency. Industry benchmarks suggest you'd need to reach 60-70% of your target audience multiple times to drive meaningful brand lift.

Given your broad target (adults 18-54) and ambitious awareness goals, do you have flexibility to focus on a more specific audience segment, or is the full 18-54 demographic essential for the retail strategy?

Turn 6:
Excellent strategic thinking! Focusing on 10-15 key DMAs with concentrated impact is much stronger than spreading thin nationally.

For DMA prioritization, I'd typically recommend a mix based on:
- Population density of your 25-44, $50k+ target
- Snack category consumption patterns  
- Media efficiency (cost per impression)
- Retail distribution strength

However, I don't have your specific retail rollout data or category consumption patterns by market. 

Do you have insights on which markets are performing best for retail distribution, or where the snack category over-indexes? That would help us prioritize the most strategic DMAs for maximum trial conversion.

Turn 7:
Perfect approach! Mixing proven big metros with your high-performing markets like Atlanta, Denver, and Phoenix is smart strategy.

Let me update our projections with this geographic focus. Targeting 12-15 DMAs including the major metros (NYC, LA, Chicago) plus your strong-performing markets (Atlanta, Denver, Phoenix) would cover roughly 25-30 million adults 25-44, $50k+.

$8M across 25-30 million people = $267-320 per thousand, allowing for strong frequency. This projects to:
- Reach: 50-60% of target audience in these markets
- Frequency: 4-5 exposures per person reached  
- Awareness lift: 8-12% (realistic and meaningful)
- Aided recall: 12-15%

This geographic concentration also creates retail momentum in markets where you're already seeing traction.

Now let's define your audience more precisely. Within that 25-44, $50k+ demographic in these markets, are there specific behaviors or interests that make someone more likely to try new snack products?

Turn 9:
Perfect! Audience locked: Adults 25-44, $50k+, health-conscious snackers willing to pay premium and try new products. 10-15 million qualified prospects across key markets.

Now for geography planning. You mentioned 12-15 DMAs mixing major metros with your strong retail markets (Atlanta, Denver, Phoenix). 

For the remaining 9-12 markets beyond those three, should we prioritize by population size of your target audience, or are there other factors? For example, do you want to include markets where competitors are weaker, or focus on regions where "better-for-you" snacking trends are strongest?

Also, any geographic regions you'd want to avoid or deprioritize in this initial phase?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 8:
Excellent behavioral insights! That "better-for-you but still indulgent" mindset is a strong targeting foundation. Let me layer these signals onto your core demographic.

Starting with adults 25-44, $50k+ in your 12-15 key DMAs, we can add:
- Health-conscious snackers (reads labels, shops premium grocers)
- Social media active (Instagram/Facebook users)
- Premium willing (shops Whole Foods, Target)
- Food trend followers
- New product trial behavior

These behavioral overlays typically reduce your addressable audience by 40-60%. So from 25-30 million base demographic, we'd target roughly 10-15 million highly qualified prospects across your key markets.

$8M targeting 10-15 million = $533-800 per thousand people, which allows for very strong frequency and precision.

This refined audience should drive much higher trial conversion rates than broad demographic targeting. Should we lock in this audience definition and move to geography planning, or are there other behavioral signals that would further improve trial likelihood?

Turn 11:
Perfect! Geography locked: 15 key DMAs covering approximately 15 million qualified prospects.

**Final DMA List:**
- Strong retail performance: Atlanta, Denver, Phoenix
- Major metros: NYC, LA, Chicago, Dallas, San Francisco  
- Health-conscious markets: Seattle, Portland, Austin
- Additional coverage: Boston, Washington DC

$8M across 15 million target audience = $533 per thousand, projecting 50-60% reach with 4-5 frequency in each market.

Now let's move to budget allocation. With your $8M total budget, how do you want to think about the split? Are you planning to allocate evenly across all 15 markets, weight toward the larger markets like NYC and LA, or give extra investment to your proven performers like Atlanta, Denver, and Phoenix?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 10:
Excellent prioritization! Let me map out your DMA strategy:

**Confirmed Markets (3):** Atlanta, Denver, Phoenix (strong retail performance)

**Major Metro Priority (5-6):** NYC, LA, Chicago, Dallas, San Francisco 
- High target population density
- Strong media efficiency

**Health-Conscious Markets (3-4):** Seattle, Portland, Austin
- Aligns with better-for-you positioning
- Strong trend adoption

This gives us 11-13 DMAs covering roughly 12-15 million of your target audience. $8M across these markets = $533-667 per thousand, allowing for 4-6 frequency.

Should we finalize this geographic footprint, or would you prefer to add 1-2 more markets like Boston or Washington DC to round out to 15 DMAs? The trade-off is slightly lower frequency but broader geographic coverage.

Turn 12:
Smart allocation thinking! Let me work through the math on your 60/30/10 split:

- **Major metros (60%):** $4.8M across NYC, LA, Chicago, Dallas, SF = ~$960K per market
- **Proven performers (30%):** $2.4M across Atlanta, Denver, Phoenix = $800K per market  
- **Remaining markets (10%):** $800K across Seattle, Portland, Austin, Boston, DC = $160K per market

The $160K per market for the remaining 5 DMAs is quite light - likely insufficient for meaningful frequency and brand lift in those markets. You'd be better off concentrating that budget.

Alternative allocation: 70% to major metros ($5.6M), 30% to proven performers ($2.4M), and eliminate the remaining 5 markets for now. This gives you stronger investment across 8 focused markets rather than spreading thin across 15.

Would you prefer fewer markets with stronger impact, or is having presence in all 15 DMAs strategically important?

Turn 13:
Excellent decision! Budget locked: $5.6M across 5 major metros (~$1.1M each) and $2.4M across 3 proven performers ($800K each). This concentration will drive much stronger brand lift.

Let me recalculate with 8 focused markets: You're now targeting roughly 10-12 million qualified prospects with $8M = $667-800 per thousand. This projects to 60-70% reach with 5-6 frequency - much stronger impact for meaningful awareness lift.

Now let's develop your value proposition. You mentioned "better-for-you but still indulgent" positioning. For your health-conscious snackers who read labels and pay premium, what specific benefits or differentiators should the messaging emphasize? For example, is it about cleaner ingredients, unique flavors, nutritional benefits, or something else that sets FreshBite apart?

Turn 14:
Perfect positioning! "Real ingredients, real flavor" with unique innovations hits exactly what your health-conscious but indulgent audience wants.

Your value proposition framework:
- **Core Promise:** Clean ingredients without taste compromise
- **Proof Points:** Real fruit, nuts, seeds / No artificial flavors or preservatives
- **Differentiation:** Unique flavor combinations unavailable from legacy brands
- **Emotional Benefit:** Feel good about indulging

This messaging should resonate strongly with label-readers who shop premium but still want satisfying snacks.

Now for execution - should the creative emphasize the ingredient story more heavily (showing real ingredients, clean labels) or focus on the taste/indulgence experience? And do you want to lead with the innovation angle of unique flavors, or use that as supporting proof of your "real ingredients, real flavor" promise?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 15:
Absolutely! Leading with taste and unique flavors is the right creative hierarchy for trial. Your logic is spot-on - taste drives trial, clean ingredients drive repeat purchase.

**Creative Hierarchy:**
1. **Hook:** Unique flavor combinations (stops them on shelf)
2. **Promise:** Indulgent taste experience 
3. **Permission:** Real ingredients, real flavor (feel-good factor)
4. **Proof:** No artificial flavors/preservatives, real fruit/nuts/seeds

This builds desire first, then provides rational justification. Much stronger for new product trial than leading with health benefits.

We've now defined your outcomes, economics, audience, geography, budget allocation, and value proposition. Ready to move into channel strategy? With your $8M across 8 markets targeting health-conscious snackers who are active on social media, we'll want to consider which channels best deliver both reach and relevance for driving trial. What are your initial thoughts on channel mix?

Turn 16:
Excellent channel thinking! For food launches targeting your demographic, I typically see successful 60/40 or 70/30 splits favoring reach channels, but your audience profile suggests more digital weighting could work.

**Reach Foundation (50-60%):** CTV + Linear TV for broad awareness
- CTV strong for 25-44 cord-cutters
- Some linear TV for older end of demo and efficiency

**Targeted Engagement (40-50%):** YouTube, Instagram, targeted display
- YouTube for recipe integration and taste demonstrations  
- Instagram for visual storytelling and food photography
- Display for retargeting and ingredient messaging

Given your "unique flavors" hook, video channels (CTV, YouTube) should be priority for taste demonstration. Instagram perfect for ingredient stories and social proof.

With $8M across 8 markets, you're looking at roughly $1M per market average. Should we model a 60/40 reach/digital split, or does your audience data suggest going heavier digital like 50/50?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 17:
Smart split! For the 60% reach budget ($4.8M), I'd recommend roughly 70/30 CTV to linear TV weighting given your 25-44 target:

**CTV (70% of reach = $3.36M):**
- Strong 25-44 penetration in your key markets
- Better targeting capabilities for health-conscious behaviors
- Premium environment aligns with your brand positioning

**Linear TV (30% of reach = $1.44M):**
- Fills reach gaps, especially 35-44 segment
- Cost efficiency for broad awareness
- Complements CTV without major overlap

This gives you $420K CTV and $180K linear per market on average.

**Digital allocation ($3.2M total):**
- YouTube: $1.6M (50% of digital) for taste demos and recipe content
- Instagram: $1.0M (30% of digital) for visual storytelling and influencer partnerships
- Display: $600K (20% of digital) for retargeting and ingredient messaging

Does this channel allocation align with your priorities, or would you adjust the CTV/linear split or digital breakdown?

Turn 18:
Perfect! Channel mix locked:

**Final Allocation ($8M total):**
- **CTV:** $3.36M (70% of reach budget)
- **Linear TV:** $1.44M (30% of reach budget)  
- **YouTube:** $1.6M (taste demos, recipe content)
- **Instagram:** $1.0M (visual storytelling, influencer partnerships)
- **Display:** $600K (retargeting, ingredient messaging)

This gives you strong reach foundation with targeted engagement to drive trial among health-conscious snackers.

Now for measurement. You mentioned brand lift studies for awareness, purchase intent, and aided recall. With this channel mix spanning TV and digital, how will you handle attribution? Will you run incrementality testing on the digital channels, and do you have a plan for measuring cross-channel synergies between your reach and engagement tactics?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 20:
Smart budget discipline! Let's build a practical measurement approach under $100K:

**Core Measurement (manageable cost):**
- **Brand lift studies** in 8 media markets (your existing capability)
- **Simple geo-holdout:** 2 control markets - just track brand metrics there vs. media markets
- **Platform lift studies:** YouTube/Instagram built-in tools (minimal cost)

**Cross-channel synergies on a budget:**
- **Weekly brand tracking correlation:** Look for awareness spikes during heavy TV weeks vs. digital-only weeks
- **Survey attribution questions:** "Where did you first hear about FreshBite?" in brand lift surveys
- **Digital behavior analysis:** Track search volume and social mentions in media markets vs. control markets

This approach gives you total campaign incrementality (geo-holdout), individual channel performance (platform tools), and directional cross-channel insights (correlation analysis) for under $75K total.

Does this simplified measurement framework feel more realistic while still giving you the insights needed to optimize and prove campaign effectiveness?

Turn 21:
Perfect! Measurement framework locked: Brand lift studies across 8 media markets, 2-market geo-holdout, platform lift studies, survey attribution questions, and weekly correlation analysis - all under $75K.

Now let's talk testing strategy. With your $8M budget across 8 markets, you have good opportunity to test and learn. Are you thinking about testing different creative approaches (maybe ingredient-focused vs. taste-focused), or would you prefer to test channel optimizations like CTV vs. linear TV weighting, or Instagram creative formats?

What's most important for you to learn from this campaign to inform future expansion?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 19:
Excellent question! Cross-channel measurement is complex but critical for optimization. Here's a practical approach:

**Primary Measurement Framework:**
- **Brand lift studies** (your strength): Pre/mid/post waves across all 8 markets
- **Geo-holdout test**: Hold out 2-3 similar markets as control group to measure total campaign incrementality
- **Media mix modeling**: Track weekly brand metrics against media activity to understand channel contribution and synergies

**Digital Incrementality:**
- **YouTube/Instagram**: Platform-based lift studies and conversion lift tests
- **Display**: Retargeting incrementality through PSA controls
- **Cross-platform**: Facebook's Test & Learn or similar tools for social synergies

**Practical Setup:**
Run brand tracking in all 8 media markets plus 2-3 holdout markets of similar size/demo. This isolates total campaign impact from external factors.

**Budget consideration:** This measurement approach typically requires $200-300K (2.5-4% of media budget). Is that measurement investment feasible, or should we simplify to brand lift studies plus basic platform reporting?
