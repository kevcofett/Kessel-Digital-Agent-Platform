# Media Plan Output: Budget Revision Midstream

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business objective. You mentioned targeting 10,000 new customers - what specific business outcome is this meant to achieve? Are you looking to hit a revenue target, expand market share, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your primary objective is ARR growth to establish market leadership, with 10,000 new customers driving $24M in revenue over two years.

Now let me run the economics. With your $500K budget targeting 10,000 customers: $500,000 ÷ 10,000 = $50 per customer acquisition cost. 

At $2,400 LTV, that gives you a 48:1 LTV:CAC ratio, which is exceptionally strong for B2B SaaS where 3:1 is considered healthy and 5:1+ is excellent.

However, $50 CAC for mid-market B2B analytics is extremely aggressive. Based on industry benchmarks, mid-market SaaS typically sees $200-800 CAC depending on deal size and sales cycle complexity.

To hit 10,000 customers at a more realistic $300 CAC, you'd need $3M. At your $500K budget and $300 efficiency, you'd acquire roughly 1,667 customers.

Is there additional budget available, or should we model what's achievable with $500K at market-rate efficiency?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Great mindset - realistic planning builds credibility with leadership. Let me model the optimized scenario.

At $500K budget targeting 2,500-3,000 customers:
- 2,500 customers: $500K ÷ 2,500 = $200 CAC
- 3,000 customers: $500K ÷ 3,000 = $167 CAC

$167-200 CAC is still aggressive but achievable for high-performing B2B SaaS campaigns with tight targeting and strong conversion funnels. This would require:

- Precise audience definition (likely 20+ targeting signals)
- Strong first-party data for lookalikes if available
- Optimized landing pages and nurture sequences
- Potentially longer conversion windows to capture full attribution

Revenue impact: 2,500-3,000 customers × $2,400 LTV = $6M-7.2M over two years, still substantial growth.

This feels like a realistic stretch goal that proves scalability without setting impossible efficiency targets.

Before we dive into how to achieve this, what's your current annual customer acquisition volume? Understanding your baseline helps assess if 2,500-3,000 represents reasonable growth or a major scale jump.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Perfect context. Going from 800-1,000 to 2,500-3,000 is ambitious but smart - it's aggressive enough to drive real growth without being completely unrealistic.

The 2.5-3x scale jump actually works in your favor for efficiency. You'll have more budget to test channels, optimize funnels, and build lookalike audiences from your existing customer base.

Let's lock in 2,500 customers as our target at $200 CAC. This gives you:
- $500K budget ÷ 2,500 customers = $200 CAC
- 2,500 customers × $2,400 LTV = $6M revenue impact
- 12:1 LTV:CAC ratio - excellent for proving scalability to leadership

Step 2 Economics is complete. Now let's define your target audience precisely.

Who is your ideal customer? Think about company size, industry verticals, job titles of decision makers, and any behavioral signals that indicate they need analytics solutions. The more specific we get, the better we can hit that $200 CAC target.

Turn 6:
Perfect - those are highly actionable signals. Companies using 3+ analytics tools plus hiring for BI/Data Analyst roles are strong intent indicators. The 250-500 employee sweet spot gives us clear targeting parameters.

Here's your target audience profile:
- Company size: 250-500 employees (primary), 100-250 (secondary)
- Industries: Tech, professional services, manufacturing
- Tech stack: Using 3+ analytics tools (Salesforce + Google Analytics + financial software)
- Hiring signals: Active job postings for BI/Data Analyst roles
- Decision makers: VPs of Operations, Data Directors, CMOs
- Pain point: Data silos, manual reporting, lack of unified analytics

This level of precision should help us achieve efficient targeting across channels.

Now for geography - are you targeting specific regions, or is this a national campaign? Any geographic markets where you see stronger traction or want to focus for faster growth?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Excellent targeting foundation. Mid-market companies with data silos is a strong pain point, and your verticals (tech, professional services, manufacturing) have budget for solutions.

Let me dig deeper on a few key signals that will help us hit $200 CAC:

What specific behavioral indicators suggest they're ready to buy? For example, are they typically using multiple analytics tools already, growing rapidly and hitting data limits, or maybe posting job openings for data roles they can't fill?

Also, within those 100-1000 employee companies, is there a sweet spot size where you see fastest sales cycles or highest conversion rates?

Turn 7:
Excellent geographic focus. Tech hubs and business centers make perfect sense for your target profile, and the 85/15 US/Canada split aligns well with market opportunity and your proven traction.

Let me calculate the budget allocation:
- US budget: 85% × $500K = $425K
- Canada budget: 15% × $500K = $75K

At $200 target CAC:
- US target: $425K ÷ $200 = 2,125 customers  
- Canada target: $75K ÷ $200 = 375 customers
- Total: 2,500 customers

This geographic allocation should leverage your strongest markets while maintaining realistic volume targets per region.

Now let's nail down your budget structure. You mentioned you have $500K allocated - is this purely for paid media, or does it need to cover creative development, landing page optimization, marketing tools, and other campaign expenses? Understanding what's included helps us allocate effectively.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Perfect approach - conservative planning with a buffer sets you up for success. $350K media spend at $140 CAC with 16:1 LTV:CAC ratio is a compelling efficiency story for leadership.

Updated plan:
- Media spend: $350K
- Target: 2,500 customers at $140 CAC
- Geographic split: $297.5K US (2,125 customers), $52.5K Canada (375 customers)
- Buffer: $25K for creative testing/unexpected costs

Now let's develop your value proposition. You mentioned companies struggling with data silos and manual reporting. What's your core message that resonates most with those VPs of Operations and Data Directors? 

Is it more about time savings ("Stop spending 20 hours a week on manual reports"), cost efficiency ("Replace 3 tools with 1 platform"), or business impact ("Get real-time insights to make faster decisions")?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
Good catch - that's a critical distinction. Let me recalculate with realistic media spend.

With $500K total budget:
- Marketing tools: $50K
- Creative/landing page optimization: $75-100K
- Available media spend: $350-375K

At $375K media spend targeting 2,500 customers:
$375K ÷ 2,500 = $150 CAC

At $350K media spend:
$350K ÷ 2,500 = $140 CAC

So we're looking at $140-150 CAC target, which is actually more achievable than $200 for B2B SaaS. This puts you in the sweet spot for mid-market efficiency.

Updated projections:
- Media spend: $350-375K
- Target CAC: $140-150
- Customer target: 2,500
- LTV:CAC ratio: 16-17:1 (excellent)

Should we plan with $350K media spend to be conservative, or $375K if you're confident about optimizing the creative/tools budget?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 10:
Excellent - leading with time savings creates immediate urgency and clear ROI calculation. "Stop spending 20 hours a week on manual reports" is concrete and relatable.

Your value proposition hierarchy:
- Primary hook: Time savings ("Stop spending 20 hours a week on manual reports")
- Supporting benefit: Operational efficiency (eliminate manual Excel compilation)
- Proof point: Replace multiple disconnected tools
- Conversion driver: Business impact and faster decisions (later in funnel)

This messaging should work well across channels - specific enough for search ads, compelling for social, and concrete for display.

Step 6 complete. Now let's build your channel strategy.

Given your $350K media spend, target audience of 250-500 employee companies using 3+ analytics tools, and focus on tech hubs and business centers, which channels are you currently using, and where do you think the biggest opportunities lie for reaching those VPs of Operations and Data Directors?
