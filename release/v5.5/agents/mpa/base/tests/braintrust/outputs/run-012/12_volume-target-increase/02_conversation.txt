USER:
Hi, I'm the Marketing Manager at HomeStyle Direct. We're an e-commerce company selling home goods. I need to build a media plan for Q1-Q2. We have a $400K budget and need to acquire 5,000 new customers. Our average customer LTV is $320. Can you help me put together a plan?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start - you've given me great foundation data. Let me work the numbers: $400K budget ÷ 5,000 customers = $80 per customer acquisition cost. With $320 LTV, that's a 4:1 ratio which is solid for home goods.

Based on industry benchmarks, home goods typically sees $60-100 acquisition costs, so $80 puts you right in the sweet spot. If efficiency runs to $100, you'd hit 4,000 customers. If you achieve $70, you could reach 5,700 customers.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 5,000 new customers - is this about revenue growth, market share, or something else?

USER:
Great, thanks for breaking down those numbers - that $80 CAC target makes sense. Our main goal with these 5,000 new customers is revenue growth. We're looking to hit $1.6M in new customer revenue for the first half of the year, which should help us reach our annual growth targets. We're also hoping to expand our market presence since we've been pretty focused on our existing customer base lately.

AGENT:
Perfect! Revenue growth of $1.6M from 5,000 new customers works out to $320 average order value, which matches your LTV perfectly. That gives us a clean 4:1 LTV to CAC ratio.

Your dual objective - revenue growth plus market expansion - is smart. Focusing on new customer acquisition will naturally expand your market presence while hitting that $1.6M target.

How will you measure success? Is it primarily the $1.6M in new customer revenue, or do you have a specific metric you'll track as your main KPI?

USER:
The $1.6M in new customer revenue will definitely be our primary KPI - that's what leadership is focused on. We'll also be tracking the number of new customers acquired and our CAC to make sure we're staying efficient. I think ROAS will be important too since we want to make sure each channel is performing well and contributing to that revenue target.

AGENT:
Got it - $1.6M new customer revenue as your primary KPI is perfect and aligns with your 5,000 customer target.

Quick note on ROAS: while it's commonly requested, platform-reported ROAS can be inflated due to attribution overlap and view-through crediting. For accurate performance measurement, I'd recommend tracking incremental revenue validated through testing alongside platform ROAS. This gives you both the day-to-day optimization metric (ROAS) and the true incrementality check.

Your economics look solid: $400K investment targeting $1.6M return equals 4:1 revenue multiple, with $80 CAC against $320 LTV. 

Now let's define who these 5,000 new customers are. What does your ideal customer look like - demographics, behaviors, or other key characteristics that define your target audience?

USER:
That's a good point about ROAS - I hadn't thought about the attribution overlap issue. We've been relying pretty heavily on platform reporting, so adding some incremental testing makes sense.

For our target audience, we're primarily going after homeowners aged 30-55 who are interested in home décor and furniture. These are typically people who have disposable income for home improvements and are actively looking to upgrade their living spaces. They tend to be pretty active on social media, especially Pinterest for design inspiration, and they research products online before buying.

AGENT:
Excellent - homeowners 30-55 interested in home décor is a strong foundation. The Pinterest behavior and online research patterns are valuable targeting signals.

Let me dig deeper on a few key characteristics to sharpen our targeting:

**Income level:** What household income range best describes your ideal customers? This affects both audience size and channel efficiency.

**Home situation:** Are you targeting recent movers, people doing renovations, or general home upgraders? Each group has different urgency and spending patterns.

**Style preferences:** Do you lean toward any particular home styles (modern, farmhouse, traditional) or price points that would help narrow the audience?

These details will help us size the addressable audience and choose the most efficient targeting approach across channels.

USER:
For income level, I'd say our sweet spot is probably household income around $75K-$150K. That gives them enough disposable income for our products without being so high-end that they're only shopping at luxury retailers.

We've found our best customers are general home upgraders rather than people in major renovations - they're looking to refresh and improve their spaces gradually. Recent movers can be good too, but the general upgraders tend to have more predictable purchasing patterns.

Style-wise, we do well with modern and transitional styles, though we carry some farmhouse pieces too. Our price points are mid-range - not the cheapest options but not luxury either. Most of our bestsellers are in the $150-$800 range for furniture pieces.

AGENT:
Perfect - that's a well-defined audience. $75K-$150K household income, general home upgraders interested in modern/transitional styles at $150-$800 price points. The Pinterest research behavior and gradual refresh approach suggests these customers take time to decide, which affects our funnel strategy.

This audience profile should be quite reachable across multiple channels, and the income range aligns well with your $320 LTV and $80 CAC targets.

What geographic markets are you targeting? Are you looking at national reach, specific regions, or particular metro areas where HomeStyle Direct performs best?

TURN 6 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're targeting nationwide - we ship across the US and want to expand our reach beyond our current strongholds. We've historically done well in suburban markets, especially in states like California, Texas, Florida, and the Northeast corridor. But we're definitely looking to grow in markets where we haven't had as much presence yet, like the Midwest and Southeast. Since we're doing e-commerce, we don't have the geographic constraints that brick-and-mortar stores do, so going national makes sense for our growth goals.

AGENT:
Excellent - national reach gives you maximum audience scale and aligns with your market expansion goals. Leveraging your proven success in CA, TX, FL, and Northeast while growing in Midwest and Southeast is a smart approach.

National targeting with your audience profile should easily support 5,000 customers. The suburban focus is perfect for homeowners 30-55 with $75K-$150K income.

Let me update our model with this geography: nationwide reach removes any audience size constraints, so we can focus purely on efficiency. Your $400K budget across national markets at $80 CAC projects to exactly 5,000 customers for $1.6M revenue.

Now let's validate the budget allocation. You mentioned $400K total - is this purely for media spend, or does it include creative production, agency fees, or other costs that would reduce the actual media investment?

TURN 7 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
The $400K is our total media budget - that's purely for ad spend. We handle most of our creative production in-house, so that's coming out of a separate budget. We don't use an external agency right now, so there aren't any fees to account for there. So yeah, the full $400K can go toward actual media investment across the channels.

AGENT:
Perfect - $400K in pure media spend gives us maximum efficiency. With your in-house creative capabilities, you're avoiding the typical 10-15% agency fees and creative costs that often eat into media budgets.

This confirms our math: $400K media spend ÷ 5,000 customers = $80 CAC target, generating $1.6M in new customer revenue.

Now I need to understand how you'll allocate this budget. Are you planning to split between customer acquisition and other goals like retargeting existing visitors, or is the full $400K focused on acquiring those 5,000 new customers?

TURN 8 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
The full $400K should be focused on acquiring those 5,000 new customers. We have a separate budget for retargeting and existing customer campaigns, so this media spend is purely for new customer acquisition. That keeps things clean and makes sure we're hitting that $1.6M new customer revenue target without any budget getting diluted across other goals.

AGENT:
Perfect - pure new customer acquisition with $400K keeps the math clean and focused. $400K ÷ 5,000 = $80 CAC target for $1.6M in new customer revenue.

Now let's define your value proposition. When targeting homeowners looking to upgrade with modern/transitional pieces in the $150-$800 range, what key message or benefit will differentiate HomeStyle Direct from competitors?

Is it product quality, price value, selection variety, customer experience, or something else that makes customers choose you over other home goods retailers?
