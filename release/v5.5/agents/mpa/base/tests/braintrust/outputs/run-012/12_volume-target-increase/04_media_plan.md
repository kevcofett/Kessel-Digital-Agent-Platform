# Media Plan Output: Volume Target Increase

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start - you've given me great foundation data. Let me work the numbers: $400K budget ÷ 5,000 customers = $80 per customer acquisition cost. With $320 LTV, that's a 4:1 ratio which is solid for home goods.

Based on industry benchmarks, home goods typically sees $60-100 acquisition costs, so $80 puts you right in the sweet spot. If efficiency runs to $100, you'd hit 4,000 customers. If you achieve $70, you could reach 5,700 customers.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 5,000 new customers - is this about revenue growth, market share, or something else?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect! Revenue growth of $1.6M from 5,000 new customers works out to $320 average order value, which matches your LTV perfectly. That gives us a clean 4:1 LTV to CAC ratio.

Your dual objective - revenue growth plus market expansion - is smart. Focusing on new customer acquisition will naturally expand your market presence while hitting that $1.6M target.

How will you measure success? Is it primarily the $1.6M in new customer revenue, or do you have a specific metric you'll track as your main KPI?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Got it - $1.6M new customer revenue as your primary KPI is perfect and aligns with your 5,000 customer target.

Quick note on ROAS: while it's commonly requested, platform-reported ROAS can be inflated due to attribution overlap and view-through crediting. For accurate performance measurement, I'd recommend tracking incremental revenue validated through testing alongside platform ROAS. This gives you both the day-to-day optimization metric (ROAS) and the true incrementality check.

Your economics look solid: $400K investment targeting $1.6M return equals 4:1 revenue multiple, with $80 CAC against $320 LTV. 

Now let's define who these 5,000 new customers are. What does your ideal customer look like - demographics, behaviors, or other key characteristics that define your target audience?

Turn 4:
Excellent - homeowners 30-55 interested in home décor is a strong foundation. The Pinterest behavior and online research patterns are valuable targeting signals.

Let me dig deeper on a few key characteristics to sharpen our targeting:

**Income level:** What household income range best describes your ideal customers? This affects both audience size and channel efficiency.

**Home situation:** Are you targeting recent movers, people doing renovations, or general home upgraders? Each group has different urgency and spending patterns.

**Style preferences:** Do you lean toward any particular home styles (modern, farmhouse, traditional) or price points that would help narrow the audience?

These details will help us size the addressable audience and choose the most efficient targeting approach across channels.

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Perfect - that's a well-defined audience. $75K-$150K household income, general home upgraders interested in modern/transitional styles at $150-$800 price points. The Pinterest research behavior and gradual refresh approach suggests these customers take time to decide, which affects our funnel strategy.

This audience profile should be quite reachable across multiple channels, and the income range aligns well with your $320 LTV and $80 CAC targets.

What geographic markets are you targeting? Are you looking at national reach, specific regions, or particular metro areas where HomeStyle Direct performs best?

Turn 6:
Excellent - national reach gives you maximum audience scale and aligns with your market expansion goals. Leveraging your proven success in CA, TX, FL, and Northeast while growing in Midwest and Southeast is a smart approach.

National targeting with your audience profile should easily support 5,000 customers. The suburban focus is perfect for homeowners 30-55 with $75K-$150K income.

Let me update our model with this geography: nationwide reach removes any audience size constraints, so we can focus purely on efficiency. Your $400K budget across national markets at $80 CAC projects to exactly 5,000 customers for $1.6M revenue.

Now let's validate the budget allocation. You mentioned $400K total - is this purely for media spend, or does it include creative production, agency fees, or other costs that would reduce the actual media investment?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 7:
Perfect - $400K in pure media spend gives us maximum efficiency. With your in-house creative capabilities, you're avoiding the typical 10-15% agency fees and creative costs that often eat into media budgets.

This confirms our math: $400K media spend ÷ 5,000 customers = $80 CAC target, generating $1.6M in new customer revenue.

Now I need to understand how you'll allocate this budget. Are you planning to split between customer acquisition and other goals like retargeting existing visitors, or is the full $400K focused on acquiring those 5,000 new customers?

Turn 8:
Perfect - pure new customer acquisition with $400K keeps the math clean and focused. $400K ÷ 5,000 = $80 CAC target for $1.6M in new customer revenue.

Now let's define your value proposition. When targeting homeowners looking to upgrade with modern/transitional pieces in the $150-$800 range, what key message or benefit will differentiate HomeStyle Direct from competitors?

Is it product quality, price value, selection variety, customer experience, or something else that makes customers choose you over other home goods retailers?
