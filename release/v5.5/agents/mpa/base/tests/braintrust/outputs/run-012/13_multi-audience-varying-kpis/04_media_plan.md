# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience with Different KPIs Per Segment

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build this multi-segment media plan with you. This is sophisticated - three distinct objectives requiring different strategic approaches within one integrated plan.

You've outlined a clear framework: $4.5M total with Conquest (35% = $1.58M), In-Market (45% = $2.03M), and Loyalty (20% = $900K). Each segment needs different success metrics and measurement approaches.

Let's start with Segment 1 - Conquest/Awareness since it's the most foundational. For the people currently driving competitor vehicles who you want to reach over a 2-3 year consideration cycle:

What specific awareness outcome are you targeting? Are you looking for aided brand awareness lift, unaided consideration increase, or share of voice against competitors in your markets?

Turn 2:
Perfect. Aided brand awareness lift and consideration shift for future purchase cycles - that's a clear awareness objective with realistic 2-3 year timeline expectations.

For measurement, aided brand awareness lift is typically measured through brand lift studies showing percentage point increases in awareness and consideration. These studies usually run quarterly or bi-annually to track progress.

Now, what's your target for this awareness lift? Are you looking for a specific percentage point increase in aided awareness (like moving from 15% to 25% awareness in your markets), or do you have a different way you'd like to quantify success for the $1.58M conquest investment?

Turn 5:
Excellent decision. 20-22% aided awareness (21% midpoint) across all 4 DMAs is realistic and maintains support for all dealerships. That's a 9 percentage point lift from 12% baseline - achievable with $1.58M spread strategically.

Now let's move to Segment 2 - In-Market Lead Generation with your $2.03M budget (45% allocation).

You mentioned the goal is leads: VDP views, form fills, calls, test drive appointments. For automotive lead gen, the primary KPI is typically cost per qualified lead, with qualified leads being those that convert to showroom visits or have genuine purchase intent.

What volume of qualified leads are you targeting monthly across your 12 dealerships? Are you looking at total lead volume, or do you have targets per dealership/brand?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it. I'll model using 12% baseline aided awareness and target 27% (midpoint of your range). You can refine anytime. Moving on to establish if this is achievable.

$1.58M for a 15 percentage point awareness lift across multi-dealership markets is ambitious but not unrealistic. Automotive awareness campaigns typically see 3-8 percentage point lifts per $500K invested, depending on market concentration and competitive pressure.

Your target implies roughly 10 points of lift per $500K invested - that's on the aggressive side but achievable with tight geographic focus and high-frequency execution.

What's your total geographic footprint? Are your 12 dealerships concentrated in 2-3 DMAs, or spread across many markets? Market concentration dramatically affects awareness efficiency.

Turn 4:
Smart question. Spreading $1.58M across 4 DMAs dilutes impact significantly - that's roughly $395K per DMA, which typically generates 2-4 percentage point lifts in automotive markets.

Let me recalculate: At $395K per market, you're looking at 8-12 total percentage points of lift across all markets, not the 15 points we modeled. To hit your 27% target, you'd need roughly $2.5M for conquest awareness.

Two strategic options:
1. Concentrate conquest budget in your primary metro (4 dealerships) for maximum awareness impact, then expand successful approach to other markets later
2. Adjust target to 20-22% aided awareness across all 4 markets with current budget

Which approach aligns better with your business priorities - geographic concentration for maximum awareness impact, or maintaining presence across all markets?

Turn 7:
Perfect context. Going from $150K to $2.03M annually - that's a 13.5x budget increase, so nearly doubling lead volume is actually conservative. Well-optimized automotive campaigns often generate 3-5x efficiency improvements over basic setups.

Your $199 CPL target is definitely achievable with that investment level. The operational capacity concern is smart - 850 additional monthly leads means roughly 28 extra leads per day across 12 dealerships, or 2-3 additional leads per dealership daily. Manageable but requires BDC scaling.

Now let's tackle Segment 3 - Loyalty/Retention with your $900K budget (20% allocation).

For existing customers approaching service, trade-in cycles, or contract expirations, what's your primary success metric? Are you measuring retention rate, service appointment bookings, trade-in conversion rate, or revenue per retained customer?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
I'll model using 900 current monthly leads and target 1,750 (midpoint of your range). That means adding 850 incremental leads monthly, or 10,200 annually from your $2.03M investment.

Let me calculate the implied efficiency: $2.03M ÷ 10,200 leads = approximately $199 per incremental lead.

Automotive qualified lead costs typically run $150-300, with $199 sitting right in the middle range. This is achievable but requires disciplined targeting and strong conversion optimization.

However, your target is aggressive - nearly doubling lead volume. To validate this is realistic: what's your current monthly ad spend generating those 800-1000 organic leads, or are these truly organic (SEO, walk-ins, referrals) with minimal paid support?

Turn 9:
Smart segmentation. With 25,000 actionable customers, $900K gives you $36 per customer annually - that's meaningful for automotive retention where customer lifetime values are substantial.

Let me calculate segment efficiency: $900K across your high-value segments means roughly $90-112 per customer for the 8,000-10,000 in service cycles, or $225-300 per customer for the 3,000-4,000 approaching trade-ins.

Given automotive CLV, focusing on trade-in timing customers first makes economic sense - they represent immediate revenue opportunity. Service customers are important for long-term relationship but lower immediate impact.

What's your average trade-in transaction value? If someone converts from that 25-30% baseline to a retained sale, what revenue are we talking about - $25K, $40K, $60K+ depending on vehicle tier?

Turn 10:
Excellent. 65% trade-in focus ($585K) and 35% service retention ($315K) makes strong economic sense given those transaction values.

$585K targeting 3,500 trade-in timing customers = $167 per customer to move conversion from 27.5% to 37.5% (10 point lift). At $35K+ average transactions, that ROI is compelling.

Now we have solid frameworks for all three segments:
- Conquest: $1.58M for 21% aided awareness across 4 DMAs  
- In-Market: $2.03M for 10,200 incremental leads at $199 CPL
- Loyalty: $900K focused on trade-in conversion and service retention

Ready to move to Step 3 - Audience definition? We'll need to define targeting for each segment, starting with your conquest audience. What demographic and behavioral signals define someone "currently driving competitor vehicles" in your markets?

Turn 11:
Perfect audience definition. Adults 25-65, $40K+ HHI, with automotive interest signals but excluding active shoppers - that's a clean separation between conquest and in-market segments.

Let me work through the audience sizing for your 4 DMAs:

Adults 25-65 with $40K+ HHI typically represents 35-45% of total DMA population. Adding automotive interest signals (competitor website visits, research activity) but excluding active shopping behavior usually filters this down to 8-12% of total population.

What are your 4 DMAs? I need the specific markets to calculate total population and project your conquest audience size. This will help validate if your $1.58M budget can achieve effective frequency against the available audience.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Got it. Service ROs as primary metric with trade-in conversion tracking. 60-65% service retention and 25-30% trade-in conversion are solid baselines for automotive.

To model your $900K loyalty investment effectively: What's your total existing customer base across all 12 dealerships? Are we talking about 10,000 customers, 50,000, or a different scale? 

This helps determine if $900K can meaningfully impact retention rates or if we need to prioritize the highest-value segments within your customer base.

Turn 12:
Perfect. 240K-360K conquest audience (300K midpoint) across your markets gives us clear targeting parameters.

$1.58M against 300K people = $5.27 per person annually. For automotive awareness campaigns, that typically generates 15-25 impressions per person over 12 months - solid frequency for consideration building without oversaturation.

This audience size validates your 20-22% awareness target. The math works well for sustained brand building.

Now for your in-market segment - active vehicle shoppers browsing Autotrader, Cars.com, researching reviews. What behavioral signals define "actively shopping" versus the longer-term consideration we just mapped? Are you looking at recency of activity, specific site visits, or search behaviors?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 13:
Excellent distinction. 30-45 day recency with high-intensity signals (multiple site visits, configurators, financing research) clearly separates active shoppers from longer-term consideration.

In-market audiences with those behavioral filters typically represent 1-3% of total adult population in automotive markets. Using your DMA sizes (3M total adults), that projects to roughly 30K-90K active shoppers across all four markets at any given time.

Let me validate the economics: $2.03M targeting 60K active shoppers (midpoint) = $34 per person. At your $199 target CPL, that implies roughly 17% conversion rate from reach to qualified lead.

Does a 17% conversion rate from active shoppers to qualified leads sound realistic for automotive, or should we adjust either the audience size estimate or lead volume expectations?

Turn 14:
Smart analysis. 8-12% is more realistic for automotive conversion rates given competitive pressure.

Let me recalculate both options:

**Option 1 - Broader audience (60-day window):** Expands to roughly 90K-120K people. At 10% conversion and $34 per person = 9,000-12,000 annual leads, which hits your 1,200-1,400 monthly target.

**Option 2 - Tighter audience, lower targets:** Keep 60K audience, accept 1,200 monthly leads (14,400 annually) at realistic conversion rates.

I'd recommend Option 1 - expanding to 60 days captures people early in their research phase when competition is lighter, and you can nurture them through to decision. The broader window still maintains purchase intent while giving you more inventory to work with.

Does expanding to 60-day automotive activity feel right, or do you want to stick with the tighter 30-45 day window and adjust lead expectations?

Turn 15:
Perfect. 60-day window with 105K active shoppers targeting 1,400 monthly leads at 10% conversion - that's a realistic and executable in-market strategy.

Now for Segment 3 - Loyalty audience. You mentioned 25,000 actionable customers with 3,500 approaching trade-in timing as your priority. 

For the trade-in segment, how do you identify "approaching timing"? Are you looking at lease expiration dates, loan payoff schedules, vehicle age (3-4 years for leases, 5-7 years for purchases), or a combination of factors? The more precisely you can define this timing, the better we can sequence the retention messaging.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 16:
Got it. 60% hard data, 40% behavioral signals for trade-in timing identification - that's realistic given CRM limitations. The 6-12 month window for leases and 4-6 year vehicle age for purchases gives you solid targeting parameters.

For your service retention audience (8,000-10,000 customers), what defines "active service cycles"? Are you targeting based on last service date, upcoming maintenance schedules, or seasonal patterns? And do you have different approaches for high-value customers versus standard service customers?

Turn 17:
Excellent. 4-6 month service windows with seasonal triggers gives clear targeting logic. The lack of CLV segmentation is actually common - many dealers treat all service customers equally despite value differences.

Perfect - we now have solid audience definitions for all three segments:
- **Conquest:** 300K competitor vehicle owners, 25-65, $40K+ HHI, 6-12 month automotive interest
- **In-Market:** 105K active shoppers with 60-day automotive activity 
- **Loyalty:** 3,500 trade-in timing + 9,000 service retention customers

Ready for Step 4 - Geography? You mentioned 4 DMAs with dealership clusters. Should we weight budget allocation by dealership density (more spend where you have 4 locations versus 2), or do you want equal investment across all markets regardless of physical presence?

Turn 18:
Perfect allocation logic. Weighting by dealership density aligns marketing investment with conversion capacity and maximizes ROI.

Let me map your geographic budget allocation:
- **Primary market (4 dealerships):** 40% = $1.8M total
- **Secondary market (3 dealerships):** 25% = $1.125M total  
- **Third market (3 dealerships):** 25% = $1.125M total
- **Smallest market (2 dealerships):** 10% = $450K total

Breaking this down by segment:
- **Conquest:** $632K primary, $395K secondary, $395K third, $158K smallest
- **In-Market:** $810K primary, $506K secondary, $506K third, $203K smallest  
- **Loyalty:** $360K primary, $225K secondary, $225K third, $90K smallest

This gives you meaningful investment levels in each market while concentrating firepower where you have most capacity.

Ready for Step 5 - Budget validation? These allocations work mathematically, but do they feel right operationally for your team's bandwidth and market dynamics?
