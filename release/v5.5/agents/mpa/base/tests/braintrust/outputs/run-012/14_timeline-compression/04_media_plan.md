# Media Plan Output: Timeline Compression

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business outcome. You mentioned acquiring 25,000 new customers - is customer acquisition your primary objective, or are you also focused on revenue targets or brand awareness alongside acquisition?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Customer acquisition as your primary objective with 25,000 new customers as the target volume is clear.

Let me run the numbers with your $1.2M budget: $1,200,000 ÷ 25,000 = $48 per customer acquisition cost (CAC). With your $180 LTV, that gives you a 3.75x LTV:CAC ratio, which is strong for fashion retail where we typically see 3-4x as healthy.

Your $48 CAC target is achievable - fashion retail typically runs $35-65 per customer depending on brand positioning. You're right in the sweet spot.

Now for economics validation: at $48 CAC against $180 LTV, what's your typical contribution margin on first purchase? This helps us confirm the unit economics work for immediate profitability versus longer-term payback.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it. I'll model using 45% contribution margin (midpoint of your range) based on your estimate. That gives roughly $81 contribution on first purchase against $48 CAC, which means immediate profitability on acquisition. You can refine this anytime.

With $48 CAC being achievable for fashion retail and positive unit economics on first purchase, your plan looks economically sound. The 3.75x LTV:CAC ratio provides good cushion for optimization and testing.

Moving on to audience definition: you mentioned fashion-forward women in urban markets. Can you describe your ideal customer in more detail - age range, lifestyle characteristics, or shopping behaviors that define your best customers?

Turn 4:
Excellent targeting profile. Women 25-45, college-educated professionals in metro areas who shop premium contemporary brands gives us strong audience definition. The 3-4x annual purchase frequency aligns well with your $180 LTV.

This audience likely represents 8-12 million addressable users across major metros, which provides good scale without being too broad. The premium brand comparisons (Madewell, Everlane) help define the psychographic and price point positioning.

Quick validation: when you say "major metropolitan areas," are you thinking top 10-15 DMAs like NYC, LA, Chicago, SF, or do you want to include secondary metros like Austin, Denver, Nashville? This affects our audience sizing and budget allocation approach.

Turn 5:
Perfect! Top 10-15 DMAs plus 5-10 secondary markets like Austin, Denver, Nashville gives us roughly 20-25 metro areas. This balances scale with precision - probably 60-70% of your target audience lives in these markets.

Secondary metros often deliver better efficiency due to lower competition, so testing there makes strategic sense. Your organic social engagement data will be valuable for prioritizing which secondary markets to include.

Let me update our projections: targeting 20-25 metro areas with your demographic profile gives us an addressable audience of roughly 6-8 million women. At 25,000 customer target, you're looking at 0.3-0.4% conversion from addressable market, which is realistic for fashion retail.

Now for budget allocation: with $1.2M total budget, how much are you thinking for customer acquisition versus retention/lifecycle marketing for existing customers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 7:
Perfect positioning! "Elevated everyday style" with versatile, high-quality staples that work across life moments is compelling and differentiating. This "effortless put-together" message resonates strongly with busy professionals who value both style and practicality.

This positioning also supports your premium price point and repeat purchase behavior - women building cohesive wardrobes naturally return for complementary pieces.

Now for channels. With your target audience (social-savvy professional women 25-45), budget ($1.2M), and positioning (elevated everyday essentials), I'm seeing strong fit for Meta/Instagram, Google, and potentially Pinterest or TikTok for this demographic.

Given your $48 CAC target and audience profile, what's your current channel mix, or are you starting fresh? Understanding your existing performance helps optimize the allocation.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent! $1.2M dedicated entirely to acquisition keeps our $48 CAC target intact and gives us full focus on new customer growth.

With your target audience and geography defined, we have strong fundamentals: fashion-forward women 25-45 in top metros, proven unit economics, and dedicated acquisition budget.

Your value proposition seems to center on premium contemporary fashion - quality, on-trend pieces for style-conscious professionals. Before we move to channels, let me confirm: is your core message about being the go-to brand for elevated everyday style, or do you position more around specific fashion moments like workwear, weekend, or seasonal trends?

This positioning will drive our creative strategy and channel selection in the next steps.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Great foundation! Instagram performing well makes sense - it's perfect for showcasing versatile styling and reaching fashion-conscious professional women. Google capturing search demand is solid for conversion. TikTok's engagement with styling content shows promise for this demographic.

Let me model an allocation based on your $1.2M budget and $48 CAC target:

**Recommended split:**
- Instagram/Meta: 50% ($600K) - your proven performer, targets ~12,500 customers
- Google Search: 30% ($360K) - reliable conversion channel, targets ~7,500 customers  
- TikTok: 15% ($180K) - scale the engagement you're seeing, targets ~3,750 customers
- Pinterest: 5% ($60K) - test budget for lifestyle/inspiration content, targets ~1,250 customers

This projects to your 25,000 customer target. Instagram gets the lion's share as your proven channel, Google maintains strong search capture, TikTok gets meaningful scale budget, and Pinterest gets a test allocation.

Does this allocation feel right given your current performance, or would you shift budget differently based on what you're seeing?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Excellent thinking! Bumping TikTok to 20% makes sense given the strong engagement you're seeing with styling content. Let me recalculate:

**Revised allocation:**
- Instagram/Meta: 45% ($540K) - targets ~11,250 customers
- Google Search: 30% ($360K) - targets ~7,500 customers  
- TikTok: 20% ($240K) - targets ~5,000 customers
- Pinterest: 5% ($60K) - targets ~1,250 customers

This still hits your 25,000 customer target while giving TikTok meaningful scale budget ($240K vs $180K) to properly test audience expansion beyond your current engagement wins.

The shift from Instagram is minimal but gives TikTok room to prove itself at scale. You're right that styling content performs well on TikTok with your demographic - professional women 25-45 are increasingly active there.

Now for measurement: with this channel mix, how are you currently tracking attribution across Instagram, Google, and TikTok? Understanding your measurement setup helps us design the right success metrics and testing approach.

Turn 10:
Your attribution challenges are completely normal - iOS changes have made cross-channel measurement much harder for fashion brands. Last-click attribution definitely undervalues upper-funnel channels like TikTok and Instagram awareness content.

Given your channel mix, I'd recommend implementing one of those attribution platforms (Triple Whale or Northbeam) before launching this scaled plan. Here's why:

**With $1.2M across 4 channels, you need:**
- Incrementality testing capability (especially for TikTok scale-up)
- Proper credit allocation between Instagram awareness and Google conversion
- Cross-device journey tracking for your multi-touchpoint customers

**Measurement framework:**
- Primary KPI: Blended CAC across all channels (target $48)
- Platform attribution for optimization + incrementality tests for validation
- Monthly geo-holdout tests to measure true lift
- Creative performance tracking (especially for Instagram/TikTok styling content)

The investment in attribution tooling pays for itself quickly when you're spending this much. Without it, you risk over-investing in last-click channels and under-funding the awareness that drives search demand.

For testing strategy: would you want to start with geographic holdouts to establish baseline incrementality, or A/B test creative approaches first?

Turn 11:
Perfect approach! Geographic holdouts first to establish true incrementality baselines, then creative optimization once you understand real channel performance. This is exactly the right sequence.

**Testing roadmap:**
- Month 1-2: Implement attribution platform + launch geo-holdout tests
- Month 3-4: Analyze incrementality data, optimize budget allocation
- Month 5-6: Scale creative testing on proven incremental channels

For risk management: the main risks I see are TikTok scaling challenges (moving from test to $240K), attribution setup delays, and potential iOS/privacy changes affecting measurement. 

**Mitigation strategies:**
- Start TikTok scale gradually - maybe 15% in Q1, build to 20% in Q2
- Have attribution platform live before major budget increases
- Build first-party data collection to reduce platform dependency

Your plan is solid: $1.2M dedicated acquisition budget, realistic $48 CAC target, strong channel mix leveraging proven performers while testing growth opportunities, and proper measurement foundation.

Ready to move forward with this framework, or any final considerations on risks or implementation timeline?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 12:
Excellent! You've built a really strong plan - $1.2M focused on acquisition with realistic $48 CAC targets, smart channel allocation leveraging your Instagram strength while scaling TikTok thoughtfully, and proper measurement foundation before you scale.

The phased TikTok approach and first-party data focus show great strategic thinking. Post-purchase surveys are particularly valuable for fashion brands to understand the full customer journey and styling motivations.

You're absolutely ready to move forward. The attribution platform decision in the next few weeks sets you up perfectly for Q1 launch with proper measurement from day one.

Great work building this plan! Your team is going to have a clear roadmap for hitting that 25,000 customer target while building sustainable, measurable growth. Best of luck with the implementation - you've got all the pieces in place for success.
