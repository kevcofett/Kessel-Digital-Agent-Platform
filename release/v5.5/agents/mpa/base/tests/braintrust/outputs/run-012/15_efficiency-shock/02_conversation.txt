USER:
Hi, I'm the Director of Digital Marketing at SecureLife Insurance. We sell life and annuity products. I need to build a media plan for next year. We have a $750K budget and need 15,000 new policy applications. Our average LTV is about $2,800 per policyholder. Can you help?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me immediately run the numbers on what you've shared. With $750K budget targeting 15,000 applications: $750,000 ÷ 15,000 = $50 per application. Given your $2,800 LTV, that's a strong 56:1 LTV-to-CAC ratio - very healthy for insurance.

For context, insurance application costs typically run $40-80 depending on product complexity and competition. At $50, you're well-positioned if conversion rates from application to policy are solid.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 15,000 applications - is this about premium growth, market share, or something else?

TURN 2 (Step 1)

USER:
That's great to hear the numbers look solid! Our main goal is premium growth - we're looking to increase our annual premium revenue by about 20% next year. The 15,000 applications should help us get there, assuming our typical conversion rates from application to issued policy hold steady. We're also trying to expand our market presence in some key states where we've been underperforming.

AGENT:
Perfect! So your primary objective is 20% premium growth through geographic expansion, with 15,000 applications as the key driver. 

Let me clarify your success measurement. You mentioned applications as your volume target, but for premium growth, I want to make sure we're tracking the right number. 

What's your typical conversion rate from application to issued policy? This will help me model whether 15,000 applications actually delivers your 20% premium growth target, or if we need to adjust the volume.

TURN 3 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our conversion rate from application to issued policy is typically around 65-70%. So if we get 15,000 applications, we're looking at roughly 10,000 actual policies issued. Based on our average annual premiums, that should definitely get us to our 20% growth target, maybe even a bit beyond.

AGENT:
Excellent! Let me update our model with the conversion data.

15,000 applications × 67.5% average conversion = 10,125 issued policies. That's solid math for hitting your 20% premium growth target.

This means your true cost per issued policy is: $750,000 ÷ 10,125 = about $74 per policy. With $2,800 LTV, that's still a strong 38:1 ratio - very achievable for insurance.

Your economics look realistic. Insurance typically sees $60-120 per issued policy depending on product mix and competition, so $74 is right in the sweet spot.

Now let's define your target audience. Since you mentioned expanding in underperforming states, who is your ideal policyholder? Are you targeting specific demographics, life stages, or financial situations?

TURN 4 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our target audience is primarily adults aged 35-60 with families who are looking for life insurance coverage. These are people who have dependents and are starting to think seriously about protecting their family's financial future. We typically see good response from middle to upper-middle income households - people with steady jobs who have something to protect but maybe haven't gotten around to getting adequate life insurance yet. We also do well with new parents and people going through major life changes like buying a home or getting married.

AGENT:
Great targeting foundation! Adults 35-60 with families is a solid core audience, and life events like new babies, home purchases, and marriage are excellent behavioral triggers.

Let me dig deeper on one key aspect: Within that 35-60 age range, do you see meaningful differences in response or conversion between younger families (35-45) versus older families (45-60)? 

This matters because younger families often have immediate urgency around new dependents, while older families may have more established financial capacity but less urgency. Understanding which segment converts better will help us allocate budget more efficiently.

TURN 5 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We definitely see stronger response rates from the younger segment - the 35-45 group. They tend to have that urgency you mentioned, especially new parents who suddenly realize they need coverage. The 45-60 group has more financial capacity but they're often harder to motivate since they've been putting it off for years. I'd say the younger families convert at maybe 70-75% while the older segment is more like 60-65%. The younger group also tends to purchase higher coverage amounts since they're thinking about mortgage protection and kids' education costs.

AGENT:
Perfect insight! The 35-45 segment clearly outperforms with 70-75% conversion versus 60-65% for 45-60, plus they buy higher coverage amounts. That's a significant efficiency advantage.

This suggests we should weight our targeting toward the younger families. If we allocate roughly 70% of our application volume to the 35-45 group, that would be about 10,500 applications from younger families and 4,500 from older families.

Let me calculate the blended conversion: (10,500 × 72.5%) + (4,500 × 62.5%) = 7,613 + 2,813 = 10,426 issued policies. That's slightly better than our 67.5% baseline assumption.

Now for geography - you mentioned expanding in underperforming states. Which specific states or regions are you targeting for this growth, and do you have any current stronghold markets we should maintain?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 6 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
That weighting makes a lot of sense - focusing more on the 35-45 group should definitely improve our overall efficiency. For geography, we're looking to expand primarily in Texas, Florida, and California where we've been underperforming relative to market size. Our current strongholds are in the Midwest - places like Ohio, Michigan, and Illinois where we have good brand recognition and strong agent networks. We'd want to maintain our presence there while pushing harder into those growth markets.

AGENT:
Excellent geographic strategy! Texas, Florida, and California represent massive opportunity - those three states alone account for about 27% of the US population.

Let me model this geographically. If we allocate roughly 60% of budget ($450K) to expansion markets and 40% ($300K) to maintain strongholds:

Expansion markets: $450K targeting ~9,000 applications = $50 per application
Stronghold markets: $300K targeting ~6,000 applications = $50 per application

However, expansion markets typically require 20-40% higher acquisition costs due to lower brand awareness. In Texas/Florida/California, you might see $55-65 per application versus $40-45 in your Midwest strongholds.

This could mean: Strongholds deliver 6,000 applications at $45 each ($270K), leaving $480K for expansion markets at $53 each = 9,057 applications.

Does this geographic budget weighting align with your growth priorities, or would you shift the allocation?

Events: calculation_performed, benchmark_cited

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 7 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
That allocation looks pretty reasonable to me. The 60/40 split between expansion and strongholds makes sense given our growth objectives. I like that you're factoring in the higher acquisition costs for the new markets - we've definitely seen that pattern when we've tested in those states before. The $53 per application in expansion markets versus $45 in our strongholds seems realistic based on what we've experienced. I think we should go with that model - it gives us a good balance of maintaining our current revenue base while aggressively pursuing growth in those high-opportunity markets.

AGENT:
Perfect! Your geographic allocation is locked in: $480K for expansion markets (Texas/Florida/California) targeting 9,057 applications at $53 each, and $270K for Midwest strongholds targeting 6,000 applications at $45 each.

This projects to 15,057 total applications - right on target. With your age-weighted conversion rates, that delivers approximately 10,440 issued policies, putting you slightly ahead of your 20% premium growth goal.

Now let's refine your budget allocation. You have $750K total. We've discussed $750K for acquisition, but successful insurance campaigns typically reserve budget for retention and cross-sell activities.

Do you want this entire $750K focused purely on new customer acquisition, or should we carve out budget for retention marketing to existing policyholders? Industry practice is often 80-85% acquisition, 15-20% retention for growth-focused years.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 8 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
You raise a good point about retention. I hadn't really thought about splitting the budget that way, but it makes sense. We do have opportunities to cross-sell annuity products to our existing life insurance customers, and retention is always more cost-effective than acquisition. 

Maybe we should go with that 80-85% acquisition split you mentioned? So we'd use around $600-640K for new customer acquisition and reserve $110-150K for retention and cross-sell campaigns. That would still give us plenty of firepower for the geographic expansion while helping us maximize value from our existing customer base.

AGENT:
Excellent thinking! Let's go with 85% acquisition to maintain aggressive growth while investing in your existing base.

$750K × 85% = $637.5K for acquisition
$750K × 15% = $112.5K for retention/cross-sell

Let me recalculate with the new acquisition budget:
- Expansion markets: $382.5K at $53 per application = 7,217 applications  
- Stronghold markets: $255K at $45 per application = 5,667 applications
- Total: 12,884 new applications

With your conversion rates, that's approximately 8,930 new issued policies. The retention budget should generate additional revenue from cross-sell without cannibalizing new acquisition.

This is more conservative than your original 15,000 application target. Do you want to adjust the split back toward acquisition, or does this balance feel right for building sustainable growth through both new customers and existing customer value?

TURN 9 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Hmm, that's a pretty significant drop from our 15,000 application target down to about 12,900. I'm a bit concerned that we might not hit our 20% premium growth goal with fewer new policies. 

Maybe we could adjust to 90% acquisition and 10% retention? That would give us about $675K for acquisition, which should get us closer to our original volume targets while still investing in our existing customer base. The cross-sell revenue from retention campaigns should help make up some of the difference, but I really need to make sure we hit that growth target.

AGENT:
Smart adjustment! Let me recalculate with 90% acquisition, 10% retention:

$750K × 90% = $675K for acquisition
$750K × 10% = $75K for retention/cross-sell

New acquisition projections:
- Expansion markets: $405K at $53 per application = 7,642 applications
- Stronghold markets: $270K at $45 per application = 6,000 applications  
- Total: 13,642 new applications

With your age-weighted conversion rates: approximately 9,460 new issued policies.

Plus your $75K retention budget should generate meaningful cross-sell revenue from existing customers without requiring new policy acquisition costs.

This gets you much closer to your growth target while maintaining some investment in customer lifetime value. The 13,642 applications versus your original 15,000 target - does this feel like the right balance, or do you want to push acquisition even higher?

Events: calculation_performed

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 10 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
That feels much better! The 13,642 applications gets us pretty close to our original target, and with 9,460 new policies plus whatever we generate from the retention campaigns, I think we'll be in good shape to hit that 20% premium growth goal. 

The $75K for retention should definitely help - even if we just get a few hundred existing customers to add annuity products or increase their coverage, that's pretty high-margin revenue. I think the 90/10 split strikes the right balance between aggressive growth and smart customer value maximization. Let's go with that allocation.

AGENT:
Perfect! Your budget allocation is set: $675K acquisition (90%) and $75K retention (10%), targeting 13,642 applications and 9,460 new policies plus cross-sell revenue.

Now let's develop your value proposition. For life insurance, the message that converts often depends on the audience's mindset and life stage.

Given your focus on 35-45 year-olds with families, what's your current core message? Are you leading with protection/peace of mind, financial planning benefits, affordability, or something else? 

Understanding your strongest converting message will help us align channels and creative for maximum efficiency at that $53/$45 per application target.
