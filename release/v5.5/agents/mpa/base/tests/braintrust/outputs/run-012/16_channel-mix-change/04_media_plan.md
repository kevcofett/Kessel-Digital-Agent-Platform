# Media Plan Output: Channel Mix Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You mentioned awareness goals - what specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with this launch? Are you looking to drive trial purchases, build brand recognition for future sales, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect - trial-focused with brand building support makes sense for a new line launch. 

How will you measure success on the trial side? Are you tracking first-time purchases, number of new customers acquired, or total trial volume in the first few months?

Turn 3:
Excellent - 500,000 first-time purchasers is your primary KPI. Let me check the math on your efficiency target:

$3,000,000 ÷ 500,000 = $6 per new customer

That's quite efficient for organic food, where customer acquisition typically runs $8-15 based on industry benchmarks. At $6 per customer, you're targeting the aggressive end. If efficiency runs closer to $10, you'd reach 300,000 customers. If you achieve $5, you could hit 600,000.

For context, successful organic snack launches often see $8-12 acquisition costs when blending brand awareness with performance tactics.

Does $6 per new customer feel realistic given your product margins and retail partnerships?

Turn 4:
Smart thinking - conservative planning is wise for new product launches. Let me reforecast with more realistic efficiency:

At $8 per customer: $3,000,000 ÷ $8 = 375,000 first-time purchasers
At $10 per customer: $3,000,000 ÷ $10 = 300,000 first-time purchasers

This gives you a range of 300,000-375,000 customers, which is more achievable for organic snacks. You'd still be performing well if you hit the higher end.

I'll model using $9 per customer as our baseline (333,000 customers), and you can refine once you get clearer unit economics from your team.

Moving to Step 3 - who exactly are these health-conscious families? Can you describe your ideal customer beyond the broad demographic?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 5:
Great profile - affluent, label-reading moms who prioritize family health. That's a well-defined segment with strong purchasing power.

A few key targeting questions: Are you focusing on families with kids in specific age ranges (toddlers, school-age, teens)? And geographically, when you say "nationally," are there particular regions where organic adoption is strongest that should be prioritized?

The age of kids often affects snack purchasing patterns and messaging, so that could help refine our approach.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Perfect - families with 5-15 year olds is a clear target with strong snack consumption patterns.

For geography, concentrating spend in high-adoption markets typically delivers better efficiency, especially for premium organic products. West Coast and Northeast markets often show 20-30% better conversion rates for organic brands.

Let me model a tiered approach: If you allocate 60% of budget ($1.8M) to high-adoption markets (CA, WA, NY, MA, etc.) and 40% ($1.2M) to emerging markets (TX, FL, select Midwest), you could potentially achieve better overall efficiency while still building national presence.

This would target roughly 200,000 customers in tier 1 markets and 133,000 in tier 2 markets.

Does a geographic concentration strategy align with your retail distribution, or do you need more even national coverage?

Turn 7:
Excellent - the 60/40 geographic split aligns perfectly with your distribution strength and should maximize both efficiency and velocity.

Now let's nail down your value proposition. You mentioned premium organic with quality ingredients, but what specifically makes PureLife snacks compelling to these label-reading moms? Is it clean ingredients, taste, convenience, nutrition profile, or something else that sets you apart from other organic snack options already on shelf?

Understanding your key differentiator will shape how we allocate between brand building and performance messaging across channels.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
That makes perfect sense - retail partner confidence is crucial for new line success. Let me reforecast with the 75/25 split:

$2.25M for trial-focused tactics: At $9 per customer = 250,000 trial customers
$750K for brand building: Supporting awareness and future consideration

This still gets you solidly within your 300,000-375,000 target range, and the heavier trial focus should deliver stronger velocity metrics for your retail partners.

Now for channels - with your audience (affluent moms 28-45, active on social) and mix of trial + brand objectives, we'll want channels that can do both performance and awareness. 

What's your current thinking on digital vs. traditional media, and do you have any channel preferences or constraints I should know about?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
That's a strong differentiator - "5 ingredients or less, tastes amazing" is compelling for your target. The texture advantage and lunch box durability are practical benefits that resonate with busy moms.

With your $3M budget and 60/40 geographic split established, let's think about allocation between your two objectives. You mentioned 70% trial focus, 30% brand building. 

Would you allocate budget the same way - roughly $2.1M toward driving immediate trial purchases and $900K toward brand awareness building? Or do you think the budget split should be different from the objective weighting?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 10:
Great question - for organic food launches, I typically see 75-80% digital, 20-25% traditional working well. Here's why:

**Digital advantages for your goals:**
- Meta (Instagram/Facebook) excels with your target demo and supports both trial and brand
- Google drives high-intent trial when people search "organic snacks" 
- Connected TV reaches cord-cutting affluent families with brand messaging
- All allow optimization toward your $9 efficiency target

**Strategic traditional:**
- Targeted traditional (like podcasts, select magazines) builds credibility in organic/wellness space
- Helps establish brand legitimacy against established competitors

For your $3M, I'd recommend roughly $2.4M digital, $600K traditional. The digital portion can flex between performance and brand as you learn what drives trial most efficiently.

Does a heavy digital approach align with your measurement capabilities and team comfort level?
