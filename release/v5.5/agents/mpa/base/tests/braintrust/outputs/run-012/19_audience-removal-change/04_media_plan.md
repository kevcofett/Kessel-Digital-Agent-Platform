# Media Plan Output: Audience Removal Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me immediately reforecast your economics: $4M budget ÷ 15,000 test drives = $267 per test drive. For automotive, test drive costs typically run $150-400 depending on the vehicle category. At $267, you're in the middle range - reasonable for EV launches which often require more education than traditional vehicles.

Your business outcome is clear: drive test drives for the new EV launch. What specific KPI will you use to measure success beyond test drive volume? For example, qualified test drives, test drives that convert to reservations, or total test drive count regardless of quality?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your primary KPI is qualified test drives with a 70% qualification rate target - that's 10,500 qualified prospects out of 15,000 total drives.

Let me update the economics: $4M ÷ 10,500 qualified test drives = $381 per qualified prospect. This is more aggressive than the $267 blended cost, but reasonable for automotive where qualified lead costs can run $300-600.

Since you're tracking test drive to reservation conversion, what's your target conversion rate from qualified test drive to reservation? This will help us validate if your volume targets align with your sales goals.

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent. Let me model this out: 10,500 qualified test drives × 25% conversion = 2,625 reservations × $5,500 margin = $14.4M in contribution. Against your $4M media spend, that's 3.6x ROAS - very strong for automotive.

Your economics look solid. The $381 per qualified prospect is achievable for EV launches, especially with your three distinct segments providing multiple paths to efficiency.

Step 1 complete. Now for economics validation - you mentioned this is your first full EV launch. How does your typical customer acquisition cost compare between your previous models and what you're projecting here? Are there any unique costs or conversion challenges specific to EV buyers that might affect these projections?

Turn 4:
Smart approach using hybrid data as your baseline - that's the closest comparable for EV buyer behavior. Your $381 target represents about 27-53% higher CAC than previous models, which aligns with industry EV launch patterns where education costs drive acquisition premiums.

The longer consideration window is crucial - if EV buyers need 2-3 more touchpoints than traditional buyers, your frequency and nurture strategy becomes critical to hitting that 25% conversion rate.

Your economics are realistic for an EV launch with proper education budget built in. 

Let's move to Step 3 - Audience. You mentioned three segments: eco-conscious early adopters 25-45, luxury buyers 45-65 switching from German sedans, and tech enthusiasts focused on features. Which of these three segments do you expect to drive the highest volume of qualified test drives?

Turn 5:
Great insight. Luxury switchers typically have the shortest consideration cycles and highest intent - they're replacing, not adding a vehicle.

Let me reforecast based on segment weighting: If luxury buyers drive 50-60% of your volume at potentially $450-500 per qualified prospect due to premium targeting, while eco-conscious and tech segments run $300-350, your blended $381 target looks achievable.

However, there's a critical consideration: luxury buyers 45-65 switching from German sedans is a relatively narrow audience, especially in just five states. If this segment drives 60% of your 10,500 qualified drives (6,300 prospects), you'll need significant reach within that specific group.

What's your estimated addressable market size for luxury German sedan owners in your target states who are actively considering EVs?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Got it. I'll model using 140,000 addressable luxury prospects (midpoint of your 120K-160K range) based on your research team's analysis. You can refine this anytime.

Let me validate the math: 6,300 qualified drives from 140,000 addressable = 4.5% response rate. That's definitely aggressive for luxury automotive - typical response rates run 1-3%. To hit 4.5%, you'll need very tight targeting and compelling creative around the switch value proposition.

This suggests either shifting more volume to your other segments or increasing budget allocation to luxury to achieve the necessary frequency and creative testing.

Moving to Step 4 - Geography. You mentioned California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Washington. Are you planning equal budget allocation across these five states, or do you want to weight certain markets based on EV adoption rates, luxury car penetration, or other factors?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Smart allocation strategy. Let me model this out:

California (37.5%): $1.5M → ~5,600 qualified drives
New York (20%): $800K → ~3,000 qualified drives  
Washington (20%): $800K → ~3,000 qualified drives
Texas (15%): $600K → ~2,250 qualified drives
Florida (10%): $400K → ~1,500 qualified drives

This assumes consistent $381 per qualified drive, but California and New York will likely run higher due to competition, while Texas and Florida might be more efficient.

California getting 37.5% of budget for what could be 50%+ of your luxury German sedan switchers makes sense - you're following the audience concentration.

Step 4 complete. Moving to Step 5 - Budget allocation beyond geography. Within each market, how do you want to split budget between acquisition of new prospects versus nurturing those longer EV consideration cycles you mentioned?

Turn 8:
Perfect approach. 70% acquisition / 30% nurturing split: $2.8M for new prospect acquisition, $1.2M for nurturing existing prospects.

Let me reforecast: $2.8M acquisition budget ÷ 15,000 total drives = $187 per drive for acquisition. The $1.2M nurturing budget works out to $80 per prospect for education and conversion support - reasonable for the multi-touchpoint EV education process.

Your plan to adjust based on early performance is smart. If acquisition is efficient but conversion lags, you can shift budget toward nurturing. If acquisition struggles, you can reallocate from nurturing.

Step 5 complete. Moving to Step 6 - Value Proposition. You have three distinct segments with different motivations: luxury switchers want premium replacement, eco-conscious want environmental impact, tech enthusiasts want features. Do you plan to develop separate messaging for each segment, or lead with one primary value proposition across all three?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Excellent segmentation strategy. Tailored messaging dramatically improves conversion rates - luxury buyers respond to prestige and performance parity, eco-conscious to impact validation, tech enthusiasts to innovation specs.

Your "driving the future" umbrella maintains brand consistency while allowing segment-specific proof points. This approach typically improves CTR by 40-60% versus generic messaging.

One consideration: separate creative tracks will require additional production budget and testing allocation within your media spend. This supports your aggressive 4.5% response rate target for luxury switchers - the right message to the right audience is critical for efficiency.

Step 6 complete. Now for Step 7 - Channels. Given your three distinct audiences, geographic spread, and need for both acquisition and nurturing, which media channels are you considering? Different segments likely have different media consumption patterns.
