# Media Plan Output: Demographic Shift Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business outcome. You mentioned 100K new customers - is customer acquisition your primary objective, or are you also looking to achieve revenue targets or brand awareness goals alongside acquisition?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Customer acquisition as your primary objective with brand awareness support makes sense for a scaling streetwear brand.

Let me work out what your targets mean: $1.5M budget ÷ 100K customers = $15 per customer acquisition cost. With $350 LTV, that's a strong 23:1 return ratio - very healthy for sustainable growth.

For measurement, what's your primary success metric? Are you tracking customers acquired, or would you prefer to focus on a revenue target? With 100K customers at $350 LTV, that implies $35M in customer lifetime value.

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using 45% margin on $135 average order value (midpoint of your range), giving us about $60 contribution margin per first purchase. You can refine this anytime.

Here's what this means: With $60 contribution margin and your $15 CAC target, you'd have $45 remaining per customer after acquisition costs. That's a healthy 4:1 contribution-to-CAC ratio, which is strong for sustainable growth.

However, this assumes immediate payback from first purchase. Most streetwear brands need 2-3 purchases to hit full LTV. If your $350 LTV comes over 12-18 months, the $15 CAC becomes more realistic since you're not relying solely on first purchase profitability.

What's your typical customer purchase frequency? Do most customers make repeat purchases within the first year?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 5:
Perfect! That repeat purchase behavior validates your $15 CAC target. With 60-70% making a second purchase within 6 months and your best customers buying 3-4x annually, you're building a solid retention engine that supports aggressive acquisition efficiency.

Your economics check out: $15 acquisition cost with $60 first-purchase contribution gives you 4:1 immediate return, and the $350 LTV over 18 months creates sustainable unit economics even if some acquisition channels run higher than $15.

Now let's define your target audience precisely. You mentioned Millennials 25-40 interested in streetwear and urban fashion. Beyond age and style interest, what other characteristics define your ideal customer? Think lifestyle, income level, shopping behaviors, or brand affinities that help you find the right people.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent! 100K customers acquired is your primary KPI - that's crystal clear.

Now let me assess if your $15 CAC target is realistic. For streetwear brands, typical acquisition costs run $25-45 depending on channels and targeting precision. Your $15 target is quite aggressive - about 40% more efficient than market norms.

This is ambitious but achievable with the right strategy. Streetwear brands that hit sub-$20 CACs typically leverage strong organic content, tight audience targeting, and efficient channel mix.

Given your $350 LTV, what's your typical gross margin on first purchase? This helps me understand how much you can actually invest upfront while maintaining healthy unit economics.

Turn 6:
Excellent targeting profile! Urban professionals/creatives at $50-75K with strong cultural engagement in streetwear creates a precise, high-value audience.

Your competitive set (Kith, Fear of God Essentials, Stone Island) gives us clear behavioral signals for lookalike targeting. Customers who value authenticity and limited drops typically respond well to exclusivity messaging and community-driven content.

Let me size this audience in your top 25 DMAs. Based on your criteria:
- Millennials 25-40: ~85M nationally
- Urban areas (top 25 DMAs): ~35M
- Income $50-75K: ~12M  
- Streetwear/culture interest: ~3-4M addressable

This gives you a substantial but focused pool. For 100K customers, you're targeting about 2.5-3% penetration of your addressable market - realistic but requiring strong execution.

Which of the top 25 DMAs are most important to your brand? Are there specific metros where you see stronger performance or cultural fit?

Turn 7:
Perfect! Those seven markets align perfectly with streetwear culture hubs. NYC/LA/Chicago as your core, Atlanta/Miami for music culture, and Portland/Seattle for creative communities - that's smart geographic prioritization.

With 60% of current customers in those seven markets, you have strong first-party data for lookalike expansion there. The remaining 18 DMAs give you room to scale while testing new markets.

Let me calculate your geographic budget allocation. If we weight your top 7 markets at 65% of budget (slightly higher than current 60% to accelerate growth where you're strongest):

- Top 7 markets: $975K (65% of $1.5M)
- Remaining 18 DMAs: $525K (35%)

In your top 7 markets at $975K, targeting ~65K customers = $15 CAC exactly. In expansion markets at $525K for ~35K customers = $15 CAC as well.

Does this 65/35 split feel right, or would you prefer a different allocation between your proven markets and expansion areas?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 9:
Perfect! "Accessible premium streetwear with authentic street culture roots" - that's a compelling position between mainstream and luxury.

Your community-driven approach with real cultural storytelling gives you strong differentiation. Customers buying into authentic culture rather than just hype explains that 60-70% repeat rate.

Now let's build your channel strategy. With $1.5M budget and your audience profile (urban professionals/creatives who follow fashion influencers and value authenticity), you'll need a mix that reaches them where they discover streetwear culture.

Based on your customer behavior and competitive set, I'm thinking:
- Meta/Instagram (visual discovery, influencer content)
- Google (search intent for streetwear brands)
- TikTok (cultural/music connection)
- Influencer partnerships (authenticity/community)

Which channels have worked best for you historically, and are there any you've been wanting to test or expand?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Excellent! The 65/35 allocation gives you aggressive growth in proven markets while maintaining expansion opportunity.

Now let's define your value proposition. With streetwear customers who value authenticity and limited drops, your messaging needs to differentiate from Kith, Fear of God Essentials, and Stone Island.

What makes UrbanStyle Collective unique in the streetwear space? Is it your design aesthetic, price point, exclusivity approach, cultural connections, or something else that sets you apart and drives that strong repeat purchase behavior?

Turn 11:
Perfect! You've got a balanced channel strategy that leverages your strengths while expanding strategically.

Now let's set up measurement. For tracking 100K customers across these channels, you'll need:

**Primary KPIs:**
- Customers acquired (monthly tracking toward 100K annual)
- CAC by channel (target $15 blended, allow variance by channel)
- Customer quality (repeat purchase rate, 6-month LTV)

**Channel-Specific Metrics:**
- Instagram: Engagement rate, cost per engagement, lookalike performance
- Google: Search impression share, quality score, branded vs non-branded split
- TikTok: View-through rates, cultural engagement signals
- Influencer: Partnership ROI, audience overlap analysis

**Critical Success Indicators:**
- Monthly acquisition pace (8,333 customers/month average)
- Repeat purchase rate maintaining 60-70%
- Blended CAC staying under $20 (allowing optimization room)

What attribution model are you currently using? With multiple touchpoints in streetwear discovery, you'll want to track assisted conversions alongside last-click data.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Based on your performance data and audience behavior, here's a strategic channel allocation:

**Primary Channels (75% - $1.125M):**
- Meta/Instagram: $600K (40%) - Your proven performer, scale aggressively
- Google Ads: $300K (20%) - Optimize search properly, capture intent
- TikTok: $225K (15%) - Sufficient budget for learning + optimization

**Secondary Channels (25% - $375K):**
- Influencer: $225K (15%) - Focus on fewer, higher-quality partnerships
- Programmatic Display: $150K (10%) - Test streetwear content targeting

This gives Instagram room to scale while properly funding Google optimization. TikTok gets meaningful investment for content testing without over-committing. The 40/20/15 split on your top three channels ensures each has enough budget to exit learning phases and generate reliable data.

For your 100K customer target, this implies:
- Instagram: ~40K customers at $15 CAC
- Google: ~20K customers at $15 CAC  
- TikTok: ~15K customers at $15 CAC

Does this allocation feel right for your growth strategy?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 12:
Exactly! Last-click significantly under-values your upper funnel channels like TikTok and influencer partnerships that drive discovery but don't get conversion credit.

**Recommended Attribution Approach:**
- **Primary:** First-party data-driven attribution (Google Analytics 4 or similar)
- **Secondary:** 7-day view, 1-day click windows for assisted conversions
- **Validation:** Monthly incrementality tests on major channels
- **Tracking:** UTM parameters with campaign/creative level detail

**Monthly Health Check Framework:**
- Customer acquisition pace vs 8,333 target
- CAC trends by channel (flag if >$20 blended)
- Repeat purchase rate cohort analysis
- Attribution model comparison (last-click vs data-driven)

Now let's plan your testing roadmap. With $1.5M budget, you can afford meaningful tests. I'd recommend:

**Q1 Priority Tests:**
- TikTok creative formats (culture-focused vs product-focused)
- Google Ads optimization (branded vs non-branded budget allocation)
- Instagram lookalike audiences (existing customers vs high-value segments)

What testing capabilities does your team have? Can you run holdout tests, or do you need simpler A/B approaches?

Turn 13:
Perfect! Simple A/B tests will give you actionable insights without overwhelming your lean team.

**Simplified Testing Framework:**

**TikTok Creative A/B (Month 1-2):**
- Test A: Culture/lifestyle content (street art, music scenes)
- Test B: Product-focused content (styling, drops)
- Budget: $50K each, measure CAC and engagement quality

**Google Search Split Test (Month 2-3):**
- Current: Likely 70%+ branded terms
- Test: 60% branded / 40% non-branded streetwear terms
- Track: Volume increase vs CAC impact

**Instagram Lookalike Test (Month 1-3):**
- Audience A: All customers lookalike
- Audience B: High-LTV customers only
- Measure: CAC and 30-day repeat purchase rate

Finally, let's identify key risks. Your main vulnerabilities are:
- Aggressive $15 CAC target requiring 40% better efficiency than market
- TikTok content creation learning curve
- iOS attribution challenges affecting measurement

What concerns you most about executing this plan?

Turn 15:
You're absolutely welcome! It was great working through this with you - you brought excellent strategic thinking and realistic expectations throughout the process.

You've got all the pieces for success: strong unit economics, proven performance in your core channels, smart geographic prioritization, and a testing mindset that will help you optimize as you scale. The fact that you're already thinking about attribution setup and freelance creators shows you're ready to execute thoughtfully.

Best of luck with the campaign! That 100K customer target is definitely achievable with this foundation. Feel free to come back if you need help adjusting the strategy as you gather data from those early tests.

Go crush it! 🚀

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 14:
You've built a strong, realistic plan! Here's your complete media strategy:

**Foundation:**
- 100K customers at $1.5M budget ($15 CAC target)
- 65% focus on top 7 markets, 35% expansion
- Accessible premium streetwear positioning

**Channel Mix:**
- Instagram: $600K (40%) - proven performer
- Google: $300K (20%) - optimize search strategy  
- TikTok: $225K (15%) - cultural content testing
- Influencer: $225K (15%) - fewer, higher-quality partnerships
- Programmatic: $150K (10%) - streetwear content targeting

**Key Risk Mitigations:**
- **CAC Reality Check:** If CACs run $20-25, you'd hit 60-75K customers instead of 100K. Plan budget flexibility or volume adjustments.
- **TikTok Content:** Budget $20-30K for freelance creators who understand platform culture.
- **Attribution:** Use GA4 data-driven attribution + UTM tracking for cleaner measurement.

**Success Metrics:** 8,333 customers/month, maintain 60-70% repeat rate, blended CAC under $20.

You're ready to execute! The plan balances ambition with realism, and your testing framework will generate the learnings needed to optimize. Strong work!
