# Media Plan Output: Outcome KPI Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect - you've given me strong foundational data. Let me reforecast your efficiency target: $5M ÷ 25,000 policies = $200 per acquisition. With $2,800 LTV, that's a 14:1 LTV:CAC ratio, which is excellent for insurance where 8-12:1 is typical.

Your target is very achievable from an efficiency standpoint. Before we dive deeper into economics, what specific business outcome is driving this 25,000 policy goal? Is this about market share growth, geographic expansion, or hitting a revenue milestone?

Turn 3:
Perfect - 25,000 new policies over 12 months with seasonal peaks in spring and fall. That seasonality insight will be crucial for our pacing strategy later.

Let me validate one more piece of your economics: You mentioned $2,800 LTV. Is that the total customer lifetime value, or the first-year value? And do you know what timeframe that LTV represents - is it calculated over 3 years, 5 years, or longer?

This helps me assess if your $200 CAC target accounts for payback period properly.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Excellent - market share recapture against national carriers is a clear strategic objective. With your $200 CAC target being conservative for insurance, you're well-positioned to compete aggressively.

Let me confirm your primary success metric: Is it the 25,000 new policies acquired, or would you also track market share percentage in your target markets? And do you have a specific timeframe for achieving these 25,000 acquisitions - is this an annual goal or different timeline?

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using the $2,800 LTV over 5 years based on typical insurance calculations. With first-year premiums of $1,200-1,400, that math checks out for homeowners insurance. You can refine this anytime with finance team details.

Your economics look solid: $200 CAC against $2,800 LTV gives you a 14:1 ratio, which is conservative for insurance. Even if payback takes 18-24 months, you have excellent unit economics to compete aggressively for market share.

Moving on, let's define your target audience more precisely. You mentioned homeowners 35-65 with $100K+ income during life events. Of those three life events - home buying, new baby, or approaching retirement - which one represents your highest-converting audience segment?

Turn 5:
Excellent insight - home buyers are your highest-intent audience with 3-4x conversion rates. That urgency and immediate need creates a powerful targeting advantage.

Given that performance difference, how would you prioritize budget allocation across these segments? Should we focus primarily on new home buyers, or do you want a specific split across the three life event audiences?

Also, within that home buying segment, are you targeting people at specific stages - like those who just got pre-approved, are actively house hunting, or are in the closing process?

Turn 6:
Perfect - 60-70% to home buyers, 30-40% split between new baby and retirement. Targeting active hunters and those under contract is smart timing.

Let me reforecast based on this allocation: If 65% goes to home buyers ($3.25M), that targets ~16,250 policies at your higher conversion efficiency. The remaining 35% ($1.75M) targets ~8,750 policies from the other segments. This should comfortably hit your 25,000 total.

Now for audience sizing: Do you know roughly how many people are actively house hunting or under contract in your target markets at any given time? This helps us assess if you have sufficient audience scale, or if we need to expand targeting signals beyond just life events.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 8:
Excellent strategy - weight toward underperforming Sun Belt markets while maintaining Midwest presence. Texas, Florida, and California represent huge opportunities with their population growth and home buying activity.

Let me structure your geography targeting with population and audience data. Do you want to focus on specific major DMAs within those states - like Dallas/Houston in Texas, Miami/Tampa in Florida, LA/San Francisco in California - or should we look at broader state-level allocation first and then drill down to metro areas?

Also, roughly what percentage of your $5M should we allocate to these growth markets versus your traditional Midwest strongholds?

Turn 9:
Perfect - 70% to growth DMAs ($3.5M) and 30% to Midwest strongholds ($1.5M). That's an aggressive but smart allocation to reclaim market share.

Let me build your geography table with the major DMAs you specified:

| Geography | Region | Total Population | Target Audience Size* | Allocation % | Planned Spend |
|-----------|---------|------------------|----------------------|--------------|---------------|
| Dallas-Fort Worth | Sun Belt Growth | 7.6M | ~380K | 12% | $600K |
| Houston | Sun Belt Growth | 7.1M | ~355K | 12% | $600K |
| Los Angeles | Sun Belt Growth | 13.2M | ~660K | 15% | $750K |
| Miami-Fort Lauderdale | Sun Belt Growth | 6.1M | ~305K | 10% | $500K |
| Austin | Sun Belt Growth | 2.4M | ~120K | 8% | $400K |
| Tampa-St. Petersburg | Sun Belt Growth | 3.2M | ~160K | 8% | $400K |
| San Diego | Sun Belt Growth | 3.3M | ~165K | 5% | $250K |
| **Sun Belt Subtotal** | | **42.9M** | **~2.1M** | **70%** | **$3.5M** |
| Midwest Markets** | Traditional | ~25M | ~1.25M | 30% | $1.5M |
| **TOTAL** | | **~68M** | **~3.4M** | **100%** | **$5.0M** |

*Estimated homeowners 35-65, $100K+ income
**Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee, Indianapolis cluster

This gives you $163-$303 spend per target person across markets. Does this geographic allocation align with your market share priorities?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Got it. I'll model using a reasonable assumption that home buying audiences provide sufficient scale nationally for homeowners insurance, based on typical market activity. You can validate this with audience sizing tools once we select channels.

Since scale might be a constraint, expanding beyond pure life events makes sense. Home value data, mortgage applications, and property search behavior could significantly expand your targetable audience while maintaining relevance.

Moving on to geography - you mentioned "key markets" earlier when talking about market share. Are you targeting nationally, or do you have specific states, regions, or DMAs where you want to focus this $5M investment?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Great point on Florida's competitiveness. Let me adjust:

**UPDATED ALLOCATION:**
- Miami-Fort Lauderdale: 12% ($600K) - up from 10%
- San Diego: 3% ($150K) - down from 5%

This gives Miami the same investment level as Dallas and Houston, reflecting the competitive intensity in Florida. San Diego at 3% still maintains presence while focusing firepower on your highest-priority growth markets.

**Updated spend per target person:**
- Miami: ~$197 (was $164)
- San Diego: ~$91 (was $152)

This reallocation puts $100K more into your most competitive growth market. Does this better reflect your market share priorities?

Now let's move to budget structure. You have $5M total. Beyond the geographic split we just defined, how do you typically think about budget allocation - do you separate acquisition from retention marketing, or allocate by campaign type, or structure it differently?

Turn 12:
Perfect - personalized service at 10-15% savings with unique coverage features. That's a strong value proposition against automated national carriers.

Your messaging framework should emphasize "Real agents who know you, real savings you can count on" - leading with the human connection since that's hardest for nationals to replicate, then reinforcing with price advantage and coverage benefits.

Now let's build your channel strategy. Given your 75% performance / 25% brand split and your target audiences, I'm thinking:

**Performance channels (75% - $3.75M):**
- Search (Google/Bing) for high-intent home buyers
- Social (Meta) for life event targeting
- Programmatic display for retargeting

**Brand channels (25% - $1.25M):**
- Connected TV for reach and frequency
- YouTube for awareness

Which of these channels do you currently use, and are there any you'd definitely want to include or avoid?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Excellent - pure acquisition focus with 70-80% performance, 20-30% brand awareness. That split makes sense for your 25,000 policy goal while building competitive brand presence.

Let me reforecast your budget structure:
- Performance (direct response): 75% = $3.75M targeting ~18,750 policies at $200 CAC
- Brand awareness (upper funnel): 25% = $1.25M supporting conversion efficiency

This keeps you aggressive on immediate conversions while investing in brand building to compete with national carriers' SOV.

Before we dive into channels, what's your core value proposition against those major competitors? When someone is comparing TrustGuard to State Farm or Allstate, what's your primary differentiator - is it price, service, coverage options, local expertise, or something else?

Turn 13:
Smart approach - search as your proven anchor with expansion into underutilized channels where nationals are gaining advantage.

Let me model your channel allocation based on that strategy:

**PERFORMANCE CHANNELS ($3.75M - 75%)**
- **Search (Google/Bing): 45% ($2.25M)** - Your proven anchor for high-intent traffic
- **Meta Social: 20% ($1M)** - Scale life event targeting properly  
- **Programmatic Display: 10% ($500K)** - Retargeting and prospecting

**BRAND CHANNELS ($1.25M - 25%)**
- **Connected TV: 15% ($750K)** - Premium reach in target DMAs
- **YouTube: 10% ($500K)** - Video awareness and competitor parity

This keeps search dominant while meaningfully investing in your growth channels. At these investment levels:
- Search can target ~11,250 policies ($200 CAC)
- Meta can optimize life event audiences with $1M
- CTV gets minimum viable investment for impact

Does this channel mix feel right for competing more aggressively with the nationals?

Turn 14:
Excellent - this channel mix positions you well to reclaim market share while maintaining your proven search performance.

Now for measurement. With your $5M investment across these channels, what's your current measurement setup? Do you have:

1. **Attribution tracking** - Can you see which channels are driving policy applications and conversions?
2. **Incrementality testing capability** - Can you run holdout tests to measure true channel impact?
3. **Brand tracking** - Any way to measure awareness lift from your CTV and YouTube investment?

Understanding your measurement infrastructure helps ensure we can properly optimize and prove ROI on this aggressive investment against the nationals.

Turn 15:
You've identified the critical measurement gaps. With $1.25M in brand investment, you need infrastructure to prove and optimize that spend.

Here's what I recommend implementing:

**IMMEDIATE (Month 1-2):**
- **Multi-touch attribution** platform (Google Analytics 4 enhanced or third-party like Triple Whale)
- **Brand search lift tracking** - Monitor branded search volume increases after CTV/YouTube campaigns
- **Geo-testing framework** - Use your DMA structure for incrementality testing

**MONTH 3-6:**
- **Holdout testing** for CTV - Test markets with/without CTV to measure true lift
- **Brand awareness tracking** - Quarterly surveys in your key DMAs to measure share of voice

**ONGOING:**
- **Weekly cross-channel reporting** showing assist value from brand channels

Without this measurement foundation, you'll struggle to optimize your $5M investment and prove ROI to leadership. Should we build measurement requirements into the campaign launch timeline?

Now let's discuss testing strategy. What aspects of this plan would you want to test first before scaling?
