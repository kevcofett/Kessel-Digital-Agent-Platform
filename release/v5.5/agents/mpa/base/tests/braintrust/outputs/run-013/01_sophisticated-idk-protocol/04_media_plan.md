# Media Plan Output: Sophisticated User - IDK Protocol

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your business outcome. You mentioned acquiring 10,000 new users - is this your primary objective, or are you optimizing for a different business outcome like transaction volume or revenue?

Turn 2:
Perfect, user acquisition is your primary objective. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success as a number. 

For a remittance business, this could be total registered users, users who complete their first transaction, or users who send a certain dollar amount. What specific metric will you use to count toward your 10,000 target?

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using industry benchmarks for remittance businesses. Typical first transaction is $250 with a 2.5% take rate, generating about $6.25 revenue per first transaction. You can refine these anytime.

Let me assess your efficiency target:

At $50 cost per user vs $6.25 immediate revenue, you're investing 8x the first transaction value to acquire each customer. This is actually quite reasonable for remittance - these businesses rely heavily on repeat usage and lifetime value.

For this to work profitably, you'd need each customer to complete roughly 8-10 transactions over their lifetime. Does that repeat usage pattern align with what you're seeing from existing customers?

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 5:
Perfect! 8-12 transactions in year one validates your $50 acquisition target. At $6.25 per transaction, that's $50-75 in first-year revenue per customer - your plan is economically sound.

Your efficiency target is realistic for remittance, where lifetime value justifies higher upfront acquisition costs. This gives us a solid foundation to build on.

Moving to Step 3: Audience. For remittance, tight audience definition is crucial since sending patterns vary dramatically by corridor and demographics.

What's your primary sending corridor - which countries are your customers typically sending money to?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - 10,000 first-time senders is a strong success metric. Let me run the basic math on your efficiency target.

$500K ÷ 10,000 users = $50 cost per first transaction. 

For remittance fintechs, I typically see $40-80 cost per first transaction, so you're right in the realistic range. However, to assess if this is achievable, I need to understand your unit economics.

What's your average transaction value, and what take rate or fee do you earn per transaction?
