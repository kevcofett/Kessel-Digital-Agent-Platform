# Media Plan Output: Basic User - Steps 1-2 Completion

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with your shoe store? For example, are you looking to get more customers, increase sales from existing customers, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Getting new customers is a clear growth objective. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success.

What number would tell you this campaign worked? For example, how many new customers do you want to acquire, or what sales revenue are you targeting from these new customers?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
That's helpful! Let's work with 1,500 new customers as a target - right in your range. At $80 average price, that's $120,000 in new customer revenue.

To figure out what's realistic, I need to know your budget. How much are you planning to spend on advertising to get these new customers?

Turn 4:
Let me update our projections. $250,000 ÷ 1,500 customers = $167 per customer. 

That's actually quite generous for shoe retail! Typical cost per customer runs $50-80 in this industry. At $167, you have room for premium targeting or could potentially get many more customers than 1,500.

A few options: You could target 3,000+ customers at typical $80 efficiency, or stick with 1,500 but use the extra budget for higher-quality channels and audiences.

What matters more - getting the maximum number of new customers, or being more selective about the quality of customers you acquire?

Turn 5:
Great question! More customers isn't always better - it depends on what those customers are worth to you long-term.

Higher-quality customers typically buy more shoes over time, return less often, and cost less to serve. Lower-cost acquisition might bring customers who only buy once or return items frequently.

To figure out the right approach, I need to understand your economics better. What profit do you typically make on that $80 shoe sale after covering the cost of the shoes, shipping, and other expenses?
