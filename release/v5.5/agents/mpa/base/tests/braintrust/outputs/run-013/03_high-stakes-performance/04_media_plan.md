# Media Plan Output: High-Stakes Performance Campaign

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business outcome. You mentioned acquiring 50,000 new merchants - is merchant acquisition your primary objective, or are you also focused on transaction volume, revenue targets, or other outcomes alongside the merchant count?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So merchant acquisition is your primary objective with transaction volume as a secondary outcome. 

For your primary KPI - how will you measure success as a specific number? Is it simply the 50,000 new merchants acquired, or do you track a more nuanced metric like qualified merchants, active merchants after 30 days, or merchants hitting a minimum transaction threshold?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 4:
Great insight. At your current $85-90 CAC, you'd need $4.25-4.5M to hit 50,000 merchants - more than double your $2M budget.

Let me model realistic scenarios:

**Scenario A (Conservative):** Keep $2M budget, target $100 CAC = 20,000 merchants → 14,000 active merchants

**Scenario B (Optimistic):** Keep $2M budget, hit $67 CAC through optimization = 30,000 merchants → 21,000 active merchants  

**Scenario C (Full Target):** Keep 50,000 target, budget $4.25M at current efficiency

The $67 CAC in Scenario B would require 25% efficiency improvement - achievable with programmatic B2B and funnel optimization, but still aggressive.

Which direction feels more realistic for your business: adjusting volume expectations to match budget, or making the case for additional budget to hit your merchant targets?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Excellent. So your primary KPI is 35,000 active merchants (processing $5K+ monthly within 30 days), requiring 50,000 total acquisitions to account for activation rates.

Let me check the economics. $2M budget ÷ 50,000 merchants = $40 cost per acquisition. With your $850 LTV, that's a 21:1 LTV:CAC ratio - extremely strong for fintech.

However, for payments platforms, typical acquisition costs run $75-150 per merchant based on industry benchmarks. Your $40 target is quite aggressive. To validate this efficiency, what's your current cost per merchant acquisition through existing channels, and what's driving your confidence in the $40 target?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Perfect. Let's lock in Scenario B: $2M budget targeting 30,000 merchant acquisitions (21,000 active) at $67 CAC - requiring 25% efficiency improvement from your current $85-90 baseline.

This positions you well with leadership since you're committing to better efficiency while delivering meaningful growth. The 21,000 active merchants should generate strong ARR impact.

Now let's move to audience definition. For B2B payments, precision targeting will be crucial to hit that $67 efficiency target. 

What's your ideal merchant profile? I'm thinking business size, industry verticals, current payment pain points - the more specific we can get, the better we can optimize your programmatic B2B approach.

Turn 6:
Excellent targeting foundation. Service-based businesses in the $10K-100K monthly processing range with fee transparency pain points - that's a well-defined audience.

To sharpen this for programmatic targeting, I need to understand the geographic scope. Are you targeting nationally, or focusing on specific regions, states, or metro areas? 

Geographic focus can significantly impact your $67 CAC target since competition and CPMs vary widely by market.

Turn 7:
Smart geographic strategy. Major metros for volume, secondary markets for efficiency - that balance should help hit your $67 CAC target.

Let me map this out: You're targeting roughly 15-20 metro areas spanning primary (NYC, LA, Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta) and secondary markets (Austin, Denver, Nashville plus other growth cities).

For budget allocation precision, what's your split preference between primary and secondary markets? Are you thinking 70/30 toward major metros for volume, or closer to 50/50 to maximize the efficiency gains from less saturated secondary markets?

Turn 8:
Perfect. 60/40 split gives you $1.2M in major metros and $800K in secondary markets - balancing proven volume with efficiency testing.

Now let's validate your budget allocation. At your target $67 CAC:
- Major metros: $1.2M ÷ $67 = 18,000 merchants
- Secondary markets: $800K ÷ $67 = 12,000 merchants  
- Total: 30,000 merchants → 21,000 active

However, major metros typically run 20-30% higher CACs due to competition. If primary markets hit $80 CAC while secondary markets achieve $50 CAC:
- Major metros: $1.2M ÷ $80 = 15,000 merchants
- Secondary markets: $800K ÷ $50 = 16,000 merchants
- Total: 31,000 merchants → 21,700 active

This scenario actually exceeds your target. Does this efficiency differential between market tiers align with your expectations?
