# Media Plan Output: Brand Building with Limited Data

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You mentioned building brand awareness in the West Coast market with a $500K budget. To start, what specific business outcome are you trying to achieve? For example, are you looking to drive online sales, get people into retail locations, or build email subscribers for future campaigns?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Online sales with email capture as a secondary benefit - that gives us clear direction. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success.

What's the specific number you're aiming for? Are you targeting a certain number of new customers, a revenue amount, or something else? This helps me assess if your $500K budget can realistically achieve your goals.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Let me update with your real numbers. $1M revenue ÷ $150 AOV = 6,667 customers. $500K budget ÷ 6,667 customers = $75 per customer acquisition cost.

At 60% margin, each $150 sale gives you $90 profit. So $90 customer value against $75 acquisition cost = 1.2:1 ratio on first purchase.

For supplements, $75 CAC is aggressive - typical runs $80-120 for new-to-brand customers. But your 60% margin is excellent (most see 40-50%). The real question is customer lifetime value. Do you have any sense of reorder rates? If 40-50% of customers reorder within 6 months, your economics work well.

Without reorder data, I'd model this as achievable but requiring tight targeting and channel efficiency. Should I proceed with $75 CAC as our efficiency target?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Let me model this to see if it's achievable. $500K budget targeting $1M revenue means you need 2:1 return on ad spend. At $1M revenue with "a few thousand customers," let's say 3,000 customers, that's $333 average order value.

For supplements, 2:1 ROAS is conservative - many brands achieve 3-4:1 once optimized. Your $333 AOV is strong for the category where $50-150 is typical.

This suggests your targets are realistic, possibly conservative. The key question: what's your profit margin on sales? If margins are 40-50%, you'd have $200-250K gross profit against $500K ad spend, which works if customers reorder within 6-12 months.

Do you know your typical profit margin per order?

Turn 5:
Perfect! With 30-40% reordering, your customer lifetime value jumps to $135-150, making the $75 CAC much more viable. That's solid unit economics.

To hit $75 CAC when market typical is $80-120, we'll need tight audience definition and efficient channels. Your 60% margins give us flexibility that many brands don't have.

Now let's define your ideal customer. For supplements and wellness products, this precision is critical. Who specifically are you trying to reach? Think demographics, but also lifestyle and wellness behaviors - are you targeting fitness enthusiasts, people with specific health concerns, busy professionals looking for energy, or someone else?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Excellent profile! Health-conscious millennials/Gen Z with proactive wellness mindset gives us strong targeting signals. The "natural solutions for busy lifestyles" positioning is valuable for channel selection later.

Let me get more specific on the behavioral signals that will help us find these people efficiently. You mentioned they shop organic foods and read labels - what other behaviors or interests help identify your ideal customers? For example:

- Do they follow wellness influencers or subscribe to health publications?
- Are they active on specific platforms or communities? 
- Do they shop at particular retailers like Whole Foods, Target's wellness section, or online wellness sites?

The more precise we get, the better we can hit that $75 efficiency target.

Turn 7:
Perfect! Those behavioral signals give us strong targeting precision - wellness influencer followers, organic/natural retail shoppers, and existing supplement buyers. The social sharing behavior is especially valuable for word-of-mouth growth.

Now let's define your geography. You mentioned West Coast - California, Oregon, and Washington. Do you want to target all three states equally, or are there specific metro areas you want to prioritize? For example, are you more interested in major metros like LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, or do you want broader state coverage including smaller markets?

This affects both audience size and efficiency - major metros often have higher costs but more concentrated target audiences.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Smart approach! Major metros like LA, SF, Seattle, and Portland are definitely premium markets. CPCs typically run 30-50% higher than state averages, but your target audience is much more concentrated there.

The good news: these metros have exactly your demographic - high income, health-conscious millennials/Gen Z who shop organic and follow wellness trends. The concentration often offsets the higher costs through better conversion rates.

Let me model this quickly. Your four metros represent roughly 12-15 million people. With your behavioral targeting, we're probably looking at 800K-1.2M targetable audience. To reach 6,667 customers, that's solid density without oversaturating.

Given the premium costs but concentrated audience, your $75 CAC target becomes more challenging but achievable with the right channels. Should we proceed with these four metros as our primary focus?

Turn 9:
Excellent! Focused on four premium metros with concentrated target audience. Now let's structure your $500K budget to hit those 6,667 customers efficiently.

For supplements targeting health-conscious millennials in premium metros, I typically recommend this allocation:

- 60% ($300K) for customer acquisition 
- 25% ($125K) for brand awareness and demand generation
- 15% ($75K) for testing, optimization, and contingency

This gives you $300K to drive direct sales at $75 CAC = 4,000 customers from acquisition spend. The brand awareness portion helps warm up audiences for better conversion rates, potentially driving the additional 2,667 customers needed.

Does this split make sense for your goals, or would you prefer a different balance between immediate sales focus and brand building?

Turn 10:
Perfect! Yes, absolutely - the 15% testing reserve is specifically for reallocating based on what we learn. If acquisition channels are crushing it, we can shift brand budget there. If we need more awareness to improve conversion rates, we can move acquisition dollars to brand building.

Now let's define what makes your brand compelling to these health-conscious consumers. With so many supplement options available, what's your unique value proposition? Is it specific ingredients, sourcing quality, third-party testing, sustainability, or something else that sets GreenLeaf Wellness apart from competitors like Garden of Life or Ritual?

This messaging foundation will drive all our creative and channel strategies.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 12:
Great questions! For Instagram vs TikTok, I'd recommend both but with different roles. Instagram for detailed product education and lifestyle integration - your sourcing story and ingredient transparency work well in posts and Stories. TikTok for authentic user testimonials and "day in my wellness routine" content where people can showcase feeling the difference.

For influencer vetting, focus on micro-influencers (10K-100K followers) who already talk about clean supplements, post ingredient lists, and align with your regenerative/sustainable values. Look for engagement rates over 3% and audiences that match your demographics.

Here's my recommended channel allocation of your $300K acquisition budget:

- Meta (Instagram/Facebook): $120K (40%)
- Google Search: $90K (30%) 
- Influencer partnerships: $60K (20%)
- TikTok: $30K (10%)

This balances precision targeting, demand capture, and credible recommendations. Does this split align with your instincts about where to focus?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Excellent positioning! "Whole-food ingredients you can feel, sourced directly from regenerative farms" is compelling for your target audience. The transparency around third-party testing and sustainable packaging hits multiple values these consumers care about.

That sourcing story and "feel the difference" benefit will be powerful in channels where you can tell a deeper story - like influencer partnerships with wellness creators or content-rich social formats.

Now let's build your channel strategy. Given your $300K acquisition budget, premium metro targeting, and need to establish trust with new customers, I'm thinking a mix that combines:

- Paid social for precise targeting of wellness audiences
- Search to capture existing supplement demand  
- Influencer partnerships for credibility and storytelling

What channels have you considered, or do you have any preferences based on where your target customers spend time?
