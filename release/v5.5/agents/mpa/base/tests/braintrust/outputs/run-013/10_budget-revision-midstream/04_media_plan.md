# Media Plan Output: Budget Revision Midstream

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business outcome. You mentioned targeting 10,000 new customers - is your primary objective customer acquisition, or are you also focused on revenue growth, market expansion, or another business goal?

Turn 2:
Perfect. Customer acquisition with market expansion into new mid-market verticals - that gives us clear direction.

Let me run the numbers on your efficiency target. $500K budget ÷ 10,000 customers = $50 cost per customer. With $2,400 LTV, that's a 48:1 LTV to CAC ratio, which is extremely strong for B2B SaaS where 3:1 is considered healthy.

This efficiency target is very aggressive. Typical B2B analytics SaaS sees $150-400 acquisition costs based on market benchmarks. At $50, you're targeting 67-87% better efficiency than industry standard.

To hit this target, we'll need exceptionally tight audience definition and high-converting channels. Is this $50 efficiency based on current performance, or is this a stretch goal for next year?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Absolutely, let's work backwards from your $500K budget with realistic efficiency targets.

At your current $200-250 CAC, here's what $500K delivers:
- $500K ÷ $200 = 2,500 customers
- $500K ÷ $250 = 2,000 customers

So you're looking at 2,000-2,500 new customers with current efficiency. That's still solid growth, and with your $2,400 LTV, you're maintaining healthy 9.6-12:1 unit economics.

If you want to push toward higher volume, we could target improved efficiency through better audience targeting and channel optimization. Getting to $150 CAC would deliver 3,333 customers - a meaningful improvement but still realistic for B2B SaaS.

What feels right as a target - the 2,000-2,500 range based on current performance, or should we build toward 3,000+ customers assuming we can optimize efficiency?

Turn 4:
Excellent! Let's lock in 3,333 customers at $150 CAC using your full $500K budget. With 65% margins and $2,400 LTV, your unit economics are very strong - 16:1 LTV to CAC ratio gives you plenty of room for optimization and testing.

Step 1 complete: Customer acquisition objective, 3,333 new customers, $150 target efficiency.

Now for Step 2 - let's validate this efficiency target is achievable. You mentioned current CAC is $200-250, so we need 25-40% improvement to hit $150. 

In B2B SaaS, this level of improvement typically comes from tighter audience targeting and channel optimization. Given you're expanding into new mid-market verticals, what's your current customer profile? Are you targeting specific company sizes, industries, or roles that convert best?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Perfect! You have a solid foundation with company size (100-1000 employees) and high-converting verticals (retail, healthcare, fintech). The rapid scaling/recent funding insight is smart - those companies have urgent analytics needs and budget to act quickly.

Your current targeting gives us a strong base to optimize from. Getting from $200-250 to $150 CAC is definitely achievable by layering in growth signals like funding rounds, hiring velocity, or tech stack expansion.

Now let's move to Step 3 - Audience definition. You mentioned three key personas: data analysts, marketing directors, and operations managers. Which of these typically initiates the buying process versus influences the final decision? Understanding the primary decision-maker will help us prioritize our targeting and messaging.

Turn 6:
Excellent insight! Marketing directors as initiators, operations managers as decision-makers, data analysts as technical evaluators. This buying committee structure is crucial for both targeting and messaging.

Primary targeting marketing directors makes sense - they have the urgency and pain point around campaign ROI. The challenge will be crafting messaging that resonates with both their immediate attribution needs and the broader operational efficiency that ops managers care about.

For audience sizing, let's layer your criteria: marketing directors at 100-1000 employee companies in retail/healthcare/fintech, with growth signals like recent funding or rapid scaling. 

What geographic markets are you focusing on? Are you primarily US-based, or do you have international expansion plans that should factor into this media plan?

Turn 7:
Smart approach - North America gives you a massive addressable market without operational complexity. US and Canada also have similar data privacy frameworks, making compliance more manageable.

For B2B SaaS targeting marketing directors at mid-market companies in your verticals, North America provides excellent reach across major metros like NYC, SF, Toronto, Chicago, and Austin where these companies cluster.

Step 4 complete: North American focus with strong geographic concentration.

Now for Step 5 - Budget allocation. With $500K total budget, we need to consider how to split between acquisition channels, retention/expansion, and geographic markets. 

What percentage of your $500K should be dedicated purely to new customer acquisition versus other marketing activities? Are there existing retention or expansion campaigns that need funding from this budget?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
Perfect allocation: $400K for acquisition (80%), $75K for expansion (15%), $25K for testing (5%). That gives us a focused acquisition budget while capturing expansion opportunities and maintaining flexibility.

With $400K for 3,333 new customers, we're back to that $120 acquisition efficiency target - even better than our $150 benchmark. Your expansion focus is smart since existing customers already understand your value.

Step 5 complete: $400K acquisition budget established.

Moving to Step 6 - Value Proposition. You mentioned marketing directors need attribution data and ROI visibility, while ops managers care about operational efficiency. 

What's your core differentiator versus competitors? Is it ease of implementation, specific integrations, pricing, or something else that wins deals when prospects are comparing analytics platforms?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 9:
Excellent! "Analytics that work in weeks, not months" is a compelling value prop for mid-market companies. Speed to value plus minimal IT burden directly addresses both personas - marketing directors get quick wins, ops managers avoid resource drain.

Your integration strength with existing martech stacks (HubSpot, Salesforce, Google/Meta) is perfect for marketing directors who need immediate attribution visibility.

Step 6 complete: Value proposition centered on rapid implementation and immediate ROI.

Now for Step 7 - Channels. Given your B2B audience of marketing directors at mid-market companies, and your $400K acquisition budget targeting $120 CAC, we need channels that can efficiently reach this professional audience.

What channels are you currently using, and which have delivered your best $200-250 CAC performance so far?
