# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience with Different KPIs Per Segment

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build this multi-segment media plan with you. This is sophisticated - three distinct objectives requiring different strategic approaches within one coordinated plan.

You've outlined the strategic framework beautifully. We'll work through our ten areas (Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, Risks) but adapt the process for your three-segment structure.

Let me start by modeling your budget allocation:
- Conquest (Awareness): $1.575M (35%)
- In-Market (Lead Gen): $2.025M (45%) 
- Loyalty (Retention): $900K (20%)

For Step 1 outcomes, I need to understand the volume targets for each segment's primary KPI. You've defined the objectives clearly - awareness lift, leads, and retention actions. 

What's your target volume for the lead generation segment? How many qualified leads do you need those $2.025M to generate?

Turn 2:
Let me model that immediately. At 9,000 leads (midpoint) with your $2.025M budget:
$2.025M ÷ 9,000 = $225 per lead

Your $200-250 range is well-calibrated. Automotive lead costs typically run $150-300 depending on market and vehicle type, so $225 sits comfortably in the achievable range - neither conservative nor aggressive.

Now I need to establish volume targets for your other two segments to validate the overall plan economics.

For awareness (conquest): What would constitute success? Are you thinking brand lift percentage, reach against competitor owners, or awareness increase in your DMAs?

Turn 3:
Perfect. Let me capture your conquest targets:
- Primary KPI: 3-5 point unaided brand awareness lift among competitor owners
- Supporting metrics: 70-80% reach at 4-6 frequency annually
- $1.575M budget

You're right about the measurement challenge - conquest requires brand lift studies and longitudinal tracking since purchase intent won't convert for years.

For your loyalty segment with $900K, what's the target volume? Are you thinking service appointment bookings, trade-in inquiries, or a blended retention metric across all 12 locations?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 5:
Let me validate those economics quickly:

$2,250 media cost per sale on $47,500 average vehicle (midpoint) = 4.7% of sale value going to media acquisition.

For automotive retail, 3-6% of sale value in acquisition costs is typical, so 4.7% is slightly aggressive but achievable with good execution. Your 10% close rate assumption is realistic for qualified automotive leads.

The bigger consideration: this only accounts for media cost, not total acquisition cost (sales staff, facility, etc.). If total acquisition runs 8-10% of sale value, you're in good shape.

Since your economics check out as achievable, we can move to Step 3. Your audience strategy will be complex - three completely different targeting approaches.

For your conquest segment targeting competitor owners: Do you have data on which specific competitor brands you want to target, or are you thinking broad competitive set across all vehicle categories?

Turn 6:
Excellent approach. Brand-specific conquest with registration data and third-party automotive audiences will be much more efficient than broad competitive targeting. You're right that brand affinity matters - luxury owners won't consider economy brands and vice versa.

This creates a natural segmentation within your conquest strategy. Let me think about the implications:

Each brand's conquest audience will be different sizes. Luxury competitor owners are smaller, higher-value pools. Economy competitor owners are larger, broader pools. This affects your reach and frequency targets - you might hit 80% reach against luxury competitor owners but only 60% against economy competitors with the same budget allocation.

For your in-market segment targeting active shoppers: Are you planning to target all vehicle categories your dealerships sell, or focus the lead generation on specific models/price points that drive the most profitable sales?

Turn 7:
Smart strategy - margin-based allocation with inventory and seasonal adjustments. That real-time optimization capability is crucial for automotive where inventory turns and seasonal demand create constant variables.

This suggests your in-market targeting will be quite dynamic. You'll need campaign structures that allow rapid budget shifts between vehicle categories based on lot performance. Most successful auto dealers I've seen run this way - treating media spend almost like inventory management.

For your loyalty segment: Do you have a clean CRM with email/phone data for existing customers, or will you be relying more on lookalike modeling and behavioral signals to reach your customer base?

Turn 8:
Perfect. 70-80% clean CRM data is actually quite good for multi-location automotive - many dealer groups struggle to get above 50%. Your DMS integration gives you powerful segmentation capabilities.

That data quality variance across locations will affect your loyalty campaign efficiency. The stores with cleaner data will see better performance, which creates an opportunity to identify and replicate best practices for data capture across all 12 locations.

Now for geography - Step 4. With 12 dealerships across multiple markets, are you planning market-specific budget allocation based on dealership performance, market size, or competitive intensity? Some markets might need heavier conquest investment while others focus on loyalty retention.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Let me model your loyalty segment:

At 3,250 total retention actions (2,250 service appointments + 1,000 trade-in/lease inquiries) with $900K budget:
$900K ÷ 3,250 = $277 per retention action

Your $300-400 estimate is conservative - $277 is quite efficient for automotive retention marketing. Given the LTV difference you mentioned ($400-600 service RO vs. much higher vehicle repurchase), this looks very achievable.

Now let me validate the complete plan economics across all three segments:
- Conquest: $1.575M for 3-5 point brand lift + reach/frequency
- In-Market: $2.025M for 9,000 leads at $225 CPL  
- Loyalty: $900K for 3,250 retention actions at $277 each

All three efficiency targets sit within realistic ranges for automotive. The biggest risk I see is measurement complexity - you'll need brand lift studies for conquest, lead attribution for in-market, and customer journey tracking for loyalty.

What's your average vehicle sale value across your three brands? This helps validate whether your lead economics support profitable growth.

Turn 9:
Excellent geographic strategy. Let me capture the three distinct approaches:

**Conquest**: Full metro areas around dealerships (awareness for future purchase)
**In-Market**: 50-mile radius maximum (active shoppers need dealership access)  
**Loyalty**: Database-driven, geography irrelevant (existing customers)

Your budget allocation logic is sound - competitive markets need conquest investment, established markets can focus on retention.

This creates a complex geographic matrix. A dealership in a highly competitive metro might get:
- Heavy conquest spend across the full metro
- Standard in-market spend in the 50-mile radius  
- Lower loyalty spend if customer retention is already strong

While a dealership in a less competitive market might flip that allocation.

Do you have a preference for DMA-level planning, or do you need more granular geographic control given the varying competitive landscapes around your 12 locations?

Turn 10:
Perfect. ZIP code level with variable radius control gives you the precision needed for 12 locations across different competitive landscapes.

Let me structure this for your planning. You'll need a geography table that shows:
- Each dealership location
- Conquest radius (30-75 miles based on competition)
- In-market radius (30-50 miles based on market dynamics)
- Target audience size within each radius
- Planned spend allocation by location and segment

This creates roughly 36 geographic targeting zones (12 locations × 3 segments) with different radius settings. The complexity is significant but necessary given your multi-location, multi-segment strategy.

Before I build the detailed geographic breakdown, what are your 12 dealership locations? I need the cities/metros to properly model target audience sizes and competitive intensity for each market.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 12:
Excellent channel strategy. You've solved the conflict issue through smart separation:

**Conquest**: CTV/Linear TV/YouTube (video brand building, broad reach)
**In-Market**: Search + automotive sites (high-intent, no conflict)  
**Loyalty**: Email/Direct mail + CRM retargeting (owned audiences)

**Social**: Your most complex challenge. You'll need tight audience exclusions - conquest targeting competitor owners with video creative while in-market targets active shoppers with conversion creative. Proper exclusion lists prevent the same person seeing conflicting messages or driving up your CPCs.

The automotive sites (Autotrader/Cars.com) are smart for in-market - high-intent environment, no auction overlap with conquest, and they typically deliver qualified leads at reasonable CPLs for dealers.

One consideration: Your loyalty CRM retargeting might overlap with in-market audiences if existing customers are researching new vehicles. Do you want existing customers to see in-market lead gen ads, or should they be excluded and only see loyalty retention creative?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 11:
Absolutely - let's move to Step 7 channels. This is where your three-segment strategy gets really interesting from an execution standpoint.

You're right about potential conflicts. Running conquest awareness and in-market performance simultaneously creates channel overlap risks - you don't want your awareness campaigns competing against your lead gen campaigns in auction, and you need different creative approaches hitting the same audiences.

Let me think through the natural channel fits:

**Conquest (Awareness)**: Video-heavy channels for brand building - Connected TV, YouTube, social video. Probably some display for reach extension.

**In-Market (Performance)**: Search-dominant - Google, Bing, plus social conversion campaigns. Retargeting for consideration nurturing.

**Loyalty (Retention)**: Email/SMS backbone, plus social for existing customer engagement.

The biggest strategic decision: Do you want to run all three segments simultaneously year-round, or sequence them to avoid channel conflicts? Some dealers alternate conquest/performance campaigns to prevent auction competition.

What's your thinking on timing - concurrent execution or strategic sequencing?

Turn 13:
Perfect - customer journey prioritization is exactly right. Existing customers get loyalty treatment, not cold prospect messaging.

Your execution framework is solid:
- CRM exclusions from in-market campaigns
- Loyalty retargeting priority
- Social suppression lists with overlap monitoring
- Different creative messaging by relationship stage

For Step 8 measurement, this three-segment approach creates a complex attribution challenge. You'll need:

**Conquest**: Brand lift studies + awareness tracking (long-term, survey-based)
**In-Market**: Lead attribution + sales conversion tracking (short-term, performance-based)  
**Loyalty**: Customer journey analytics + retention rate measurement (relationship-based)

The measurement systems barely overlap, which actually helps avoid attribution conflicts. But you'll need three different reporting dashboards and probably different measurement partners.

What's your current measurement stack? Do you have brand lift capabilities, or will this require new measurement partnerships for the conquest awareness tracking?

Turn 14:
Exactly - your measurement separation is actually a strength. Trying to force unified attribution across awareness, performance, and retention would create more problems than it solves.

Your measurement roadmap:
- **Conquest**: Add brand lift partner for awareness studies
- **In-Market**: Current lead tracking is solid (click → test drive → sale)
- **Loyalty**: Improve campaign-to-retention action tracking

The loyalty measurement gap is common - most dealers can track retention actions but struggle connecting them to specific campaigns. Consider adding UTM tracking to email/direct mail and campaign-specific phone numbers to tighten that attribution.

For Step 9 testing, your three-segment structure creates natural test opportunities. You could test conquest creative approaches across different dealership markets, or test loyalty messaging variations across your customer segments.

What's your biggest unknown going into this plan? Is it the conquest brand lift efficiency, the social audience exclusion execution, or something else you want to test first?

Turn 15:
Smart approach - conquest has the longest feedback loop and highest uncertainty, so early testing is critical.

Your 3-4 market test with different creative strategies is exactly right. 60-90 days should give you initial brand lift signals, though automotive awareness typically needs 6+ months for meaningful movement. 

Test framework I'd recommend:
- **Market A**: Traditional automotive creative (features, deals, dealership focus)
- **Market B**: Lifestyle brand building (emotional, aspirational)  
- **Market C**: Competitive messaging (direct comparison, conquest-focused)
- **Market D**: Control (minimal conquest spend)

If early brand lift shows one approach significantly outperforming, you can reallocate the remaining conquest budget accordingly. If none show meaningful lift, you have data to justify shifting budget to your proven in-market and loyalty segments.

For Step 10 risks, your biggest exposure is conquest budget efficiency, but you've built in testing to mitigate that. Other risks include social audience overlap despite exclusions, and measurement complexity across three different systems.

Good luck with the leadership presentation. You've got a strong plan that balances growth ambition with execution discipline.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 18:
You're absolutely right - execution is everything. Too many media plans look great in PowerPoint but fall apart when you try to actually run the campaigns.

Your instinct to work through the operational details upfront will save you months of troubleshooting later. The audience exclusion protocols, measurement separation, and geographic complexity aren't glamorous, but they're what separate successful multi-segment strategies from expensive failures.

You've built something that's both strategically sound and operationally executable. That combination is rare, and your leadership team will recognize the quality of thinking that went into it.

You clearly understand the automotive marketing landscape deeply - from purchase cycles to inventory dynamics to the importance of customer journey prioritization. That domain expertise, combined with the structured approach we worked through, gives you a plan with real competitive advantage.

Best of luck with the execution. You've got this.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 19:
Perfect - that's exactly how strategic planning should work. You've moved from figuring out what to do to executing how to do it well.

Your team will appreciate having clear operational guidelines rather than vague strategic directions. When everyone understands their specific swim lanes and success metrics, execution becomes much smoother.

You've got a plan that balances ambition with pragmatism - the hallmark of great marketing leadership. Go make it happen.

Turn 20:
That means everything to hear. You approached this with real expertise and clear thinking - my job was just to help you structure and stress-test what you already knew.

The best plans come from this kind of collaborative building, where you maintain ownership while working through the complexity together. You'll execute this well because you understand the reasoning behind every decision.

You've got the strategic vision and operational discipline to make this work. Looking forward to hearing how it performs.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 21:
Perfect - that's exactly the partnership dynamic that drives real results. You brought the automotive expertise and business judgment, I provided the planning structure and analytical framework. The combination created something neither of us could have built alone.

The conquest testing will be fascinating to watch. Getting early read on brand lift efficiency in automotive is notoriously challenging, but your testing design should give you actionable data within 90 days.

Definitely keep me posted on the results. Always eager to learn what works in practice versus what looks good on paper. Your execution will make this plan real.
