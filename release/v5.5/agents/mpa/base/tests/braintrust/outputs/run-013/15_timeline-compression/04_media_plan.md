# Media Plan Output: Timeline Compression

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business outcome. You mentioned acquiring 25,000 new customers - is customer acquisition your primary objective, or are you also focused on other outcomes like brand awareness or retention?

Turn 2:
Perfect, customer acquisition is your primary objective with some brand awareness benefits. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success as a number.

Your target is 25,000 new customers, and with your $1.2M budget, that implies $48 per customer ($1.2M ÷ 25,000). Given your $180 LTV, that's a strong 3.75x LTV:CAC ratio.

What's your primary KPI - the specific number you'll track to know if you're winning? Will it be cost per acquisition, return on ad spend, or something else?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - CPA at or below $48 as your primary KPI makes perfect sense for growth mode.

Your $48 target is actually quite efficient for fashion retail. Based on industry benchmarks, fashion brands typically see CPAs between $45-75, so you're targeting the lower end of that range. With your 3.75x LTV:CAC ratio, you have solid unit economics.

One quick validation: At $180 LTV, what's your typical contribution margin after cost of goods sold? This helps confirm your $48 CPA leaves enough room for profitability and business operations.

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using 62% contribution margin based on your estimate - that gives you about $111 contribution per customer at $180 LTV, which comfortably supports your $48 CPA target. You can refine with finance anytime.

Your economics look solid: at $48 CPA with $111 contribution, you're generating 2.3x return on acquisition spend, which is healthy for fashion retail growth mode.

Moving on - now I need to understand your target customers. Who are you trying to reach with this 25,000 customer acquisition? Can you describe your ideal customer profile?

Turn 5:
Great audience definition! Fashion-forward women 25-45 in urban areas with social media engagement patterns gives us a solid foundation.

A few key considerations for your targeting precision: This demographic is highly competitive in fashion retail, which could impact your $48 CPA target. The 20-year age range and "urban areas" scope suggests a large addressable audience, which is good for scale but may require refinement for efficiency.

To optimize your targeting strategy: Are you looking to focus on specific urban markets or metro areas, or is this a national urban play? And within that 25-45 age range, do you see different behavior patterns - like younger customers being more price-sensitive or older customers having higher average order values?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Perfect - that metro focus and age segment insight is valuable. The 30-40 group's higher AOV and retention suggests they may drive efficiency gains, while 25-30 provides organic amplification benefits.

Your target metros (NYC, LA, Chicago, SF, Austin, Nashville) are premium markets with strong fashion engagement, which supports your positioning but also means higher competition and potentially higher CPAs.

Now let's define your geographic strategy. You mentioned major metros plus tier 2 cities - should we structure this as a DMA-level plan covering roughly 6-8 markets, or are you thinking broader geographic coverage? This will determine how we allocate your $1.2M budget and set realistic customer acquisition targets by market.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Perfect - 75/25 split aligns well with your customer concentration patterns. That gives us roughly $900K for major metros and $300K for tier 2 markets.

Let me validate the math: At your $48 CPA target, $900K projects to ~18,750 customers from major metros and $300K projects to ~6,250 customers from tier 2 cities, hitting your 25,000 total.

However, major metros typically run 15-25% higher CPAs due to competition. If major metro CPA averages $55 vs tier 2 at $35, you'd get ~16,350 + 8,570 = ~24,920 customers - very close to target.

Does this geographic efficiency assumption feel realistic based on your experience, or should we adjust the allocation to ensure you hit 25,000 customers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Excellent strategy - going deep in 6-8 DMAs rather than spreading thin. The major metro weighting with tier 2 growth opportunities should help balance scale with efficiency.

For budget allocation across these markets, are you thinking roughly 70-80% toward the major metros (NYC, LA, Chicago, SF) with 20-30% toward the tier 2 cities? And within those markets, do you have any sense of current customer concentration - like if 40% of existing customers come from NYC/LA, that might inform our allocation strategy?

Turn 9:
Smart thinking - strategic market focus over chasing exact numbers. The 75/25 split gives you the right foundation, and optimization gains throughout the year should easily close that 80-customer gap.

Now let's develop your value proposition. You mentioned customers value quality, unique pieces, and personal style expression. When these fashion-forward women are deciding between you and bigger fashion retailers, what's your core differentiator? 

Is it the uniqueness/exclusivity of your pieces, the quality-to-price ratio, the style curation, or something else that makes them choose Urban Essentials over the competition?

Turn 10:
Perfect - that curated exclusivity and "unique find" positioning is a strong differentiator that justifies premium pricing and should resonate well with your target audience.

Your value proposition of exclusive, curated pieces from emerging designers directly addresses your audience's desire for individual style expression. This also explains why your 25-30 segment amplifies organically - they're sharing unique discoveries with their networks.

Now let's structure your $1.2M budget. We have your 75/25 geographic split. Should we also consider allocating budget by your age segments - perhaps weighting toward the higher-LTV 30-40 group while maintaining presence with the 25-30 amplifiers? Or do you prefer to keep the age targeting flexible within your overall audience approach?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Smart approach - keeping age targeting flexible preserves optimization opportunities and captures those hard-to-quantify amplification benefits. Geographic and channel allocation will give you the structure you need without over-constraining the platforms.

So we have $1.2M allocated 75/25 across major metros vs tier 2 cities, targeting fashion-forward women 25-45 with your curated exclusivity positioning.

Now let's build your channel strategy. Given your audience's social media behavior (Instagram/TikTok discovery), urban concentration, and need for both acquisition efficiency and some brand awareness, what channels are you currently considering or have worked well for you in the past?

Turn 12:
Excellent channel instincts - Instagram and TikTok align perfectly with your audience's discovery behavior and your visual product storytelling needs. Google Search for intent capture makes complete sense.

Given your $1.2M budget and performance history, I'm thinking roughly 50-60% for Instagram/TikTok combined, 25-30% for Google Search, with 10-15% reserved for testing or supporting channels. 

A few considerations: TikTok typically requires higher minimum spends for optimization but offers strong discovery potential. Instagram provides better retargeting capabilities. Google Search will likely deliver your most efficient CPAs but limited scale for 25K customers.

What split between Instagram and TikTok feels right based on your current performance, and do you see any other channels worth testing with a smaller allocation?
