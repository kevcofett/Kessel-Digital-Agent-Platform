# Media Plan Output: Behavioral Targeting Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your economics since you've provided solid data. With $800K for 50K subscribers, that's $16 per subscriber acquisition cost. Against your $420 LTV, that's a 26:1 ratio - exceptionally strong unit economics that gives us significant flexibility.

For Step 1 outcomes: You want 50K new subscribers, but what's the primary business outcome you're trying to achieve? Is this about hitting a revenue milestone, proving market expansion, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect! So your primary business outcome is revenue growth through subscriber base expansion - specifically adding $21M in LTV to support Series B positioning. The 50K new subscribers representing 40% growth shows meaningful scale.

Your primary KPI is clear: 50K new subscribers at $16 acquisition cost. Let me validate this efficiency target.

$800K ÷ 50K = $16 CAC against $420 LTV gives you a 26:1 ratio. For subscription nutrition, typical CAC runs $25-45, so your $16 target is aggressive - you're aiming for 36-44% better efficiency than market average.

This is achievable given your proven product-market fit, but requires precise targeting and channel optimization. The strong unit economics give us room to test and scale what works.

Now for Step 2 economics: What's your contribution margin on that $420 LTV? Understanding profitability timing helps determine how aggressive we can be with acquisition spend.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 3:
Excellent - 65% contribution margin ($273) against $16 CAC gives you a 17:1 contribution ratio. With 3-4 month payback, you have strong cash flow for reinvestment. Your conservative approach makes sense for Series B positioning.

Let me update the feasibility assessment: At $16 CAC vs typical $25-45 for subscription nutrition, you're targeting 36-64% better efficiency than market. This is aggressive but smart given your fundraising timeline - investors will value proven acquisition efficiency.

The math works: $800K budget × 65% contribution = $520K gross profit on $273 × 50K = $13.65M total contribution. Strong unit economics provide buffer for optimization.

Step 2 is complete - your efficiency targets are ambitious but achievable with the right execution.

Moving to Step 3 - Audience: You mentioned fitness enthusiasts 25-55. Can you describe your current subscriber base more specifically? What behavioral signals or interests define your highest-value customers beyond basic demographics?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Perfect - that's a much more precise audience than general fitness enthusiasts. Endurance athletes with structured training are a high-intent, science-driven segment willing to pay premium for performance gains.

Let me build the targeting framework:

**Core Behavioral Signals:**
- 8+ hours weekly training commitment
- Event-focused training (marathons, cycling events, triathlons)
- Strava/training app usage
- Premium sports brand purchases (Specialized, Garmin, performance running)
- Endurance sports influencer engagement

**Psychographic Profile:**
- Performance-driven mindset
- Science-based nutrition approach
- Structured training methodology
- Premium-for-quality value orientation

This audience is much smaller than general fitness but significantly higher converting. The precision should help hit your aggressive $16 CAC target.

Quick validation: How does this 25-55 age range perform for you currently? Do you see meaningful differences in LTV or engagement between younger vs older segments within this range?

Turn 5:
Excellent insight - the 30-45 sweet spot balances acquisition efficiency with LTV optimization. That tightens our targeting and should improve your path to $16 CAC.

**Refined Audience Priority:**
- **Primary:** 30-45 endurance athletes (highest LTV + good conversion)
- **Secondary:** 25-35 high-engagement athletes 
- **Tertiary:** 45-55 selective optimizers

This age refinement plus the behavioral signals (structured training, premium brands, performance tracking) creates a precise audience definition that aligns with your proven customer base.

Moving to Step 4 - Geography: You mentioned targeting across the US initially. Do you see geographic patterns in your current subscriber base? Are there regions with higher concentrations of endurance athletes or better performance that we should prioritize?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Great data - clear geographic performance patterns that align with endurance training culture and climate advantages.

**Geographic Priority Framework:**
- **Tier 1:** West Coast (CA, OR, WA) + Colorado - proven performance, year-round training culture
- **Tier 2:** Northeast metros (Boston, DC corridor) - strong marathon culture, income demographics  
- **Tier 3:** Texas metros (Austin, Dallas) - decent performance, growing markets
- **Deprioritize:** Southeast - lower conversion and retention

This geographic focus should improve your acquisition efficiency by concentrating spend in proven markets rather than spreading thin nationally.

Quick allocation question: With your $800K budget, would you prefer to go deep in Tier 1 markets first to maximize efficiency, or allocate across all tiers to test expansion potential? The choice affects both your path to $16 CAC and geographic learning for Series B growth story.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Perfect allocation strategy - 60% Tier 1 / 25% Tier 2 / 15% Tier 3 balances efficiency with expansion learning.

**Budget Geographic Allocation:**
- **Tier 1 (60% = $480K):** West Coast + Colorado - efficiency anchor
- **Tier 2 (25% = $200K):** Northeast metros - proven scale opportunity  
- **Tier 3 (15% = $120K):** Texas metros - expansion testing

This prioritizes your $16 CAC target while building Series B scalability narrative. Smart approach.

Moving to Step 5 - Budget: Beyond the geographic split, do you have preferences for how to allocate the $800K across acquisition vs retention activities, or different campaign objectives? For example, some subscription brands reserve 10-20% for retention/winback campaigns alongside new acquisition.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 8:
Smart allocation - 85% acquisition ($680K) / 15% retention ($120K) protects your LTV assumptions while strengthening investor metrics.

Let me update the acquisition math: $680K ÷ 50K subscribers = $13.60 acquisition CAC. That's even better than your original $16 target and provides more buffer against your aggressive efficiency goals.

**Final Budget Framework:**
- **New Acquisition: $680K** (targeting 50K subscribers at $13.60 CAC)
- **Retention/Winback: $120K** (protecting $420 LTV assumption)
- **Geographic split within acquisition:** 60% Tier 1 / 25% Tier 2 / 15% Tier 3

The retention investment should help maintain your 3-4 month payback timeline and strengthen Series B positioning with retention metrics.

Moving to Step 6 - Value Proposition: What's your core messaging framework for acquisition? How do you position EnduraFuel against competitors when targeting these performance-focused endurance athletes?
