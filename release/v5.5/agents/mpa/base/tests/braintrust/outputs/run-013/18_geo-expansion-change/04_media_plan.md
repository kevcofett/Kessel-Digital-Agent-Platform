# Media Plan Output: Geography Expansion Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start - you've given me great foundational data. Let me quickly assess what you've shared: $2.5M budget targeting 500,000 visits/conversions means you're aiming for $5 per action. For athletic apparel driving store visits plus online conversions, that's quite efficient - typical ranges $8-15 per action.

To define success clearly: when you say "store visits and online conversions combined" - what's the primary business outcome you're trying to achieve? Are you focused on brand awareness, driving immediate sales, or building long-term customer relationships?

Turn 3:
Excellent - $25-30M attributed revenue is your primary KPI with 10-12x ROAS target. That's quite ambitious for athletic apparel where industry typically sees 4-6x ROAS.

Let me check the math: $2.5M spend targeting $27.5M revenue (midpoint) requires 11x efficiency. At that level, you'd need about $23 average order value to hit your 500K action target, or higher AOV with fewer actions.

What's your typical average order value for both online and in-store purchases? And do you have a sense of your profit margins on athletic apparel sales?

Turn 4:
Perfect adjustment - let me recalculate with realistic expectations. $2.5M at 5x ROAS (middle of 4-6x range) projects $12.5M revenue. With $180 AOV, that's about 69,500 transactions - much more achievable than 500K.

At 42.5% gross margin (midpoint), each $180 sale generates $76.50 profit. Your $2.5M spend against $12.5M revenue means you're investing 20% of revenue in media - that's aggressive but workable if execution is tight.

This gives us $36 per transaction ($2.5M ÷ 69,500). For athletic apparel driving both online and store visits, $36 is realistic - right in the sweet spot.

Does targeting around 70,000 transactions at $180 AOV feel more aligned with your business reality than the original 500K actions?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Got it - revenue growth through immediate sales is your primary objective. That's a clear business outcome.

Now let's define how you'll measure success. Since you're driving both online sales and store visits, what's the key number you'll track to know if this campaign succeeded? 

For example: total revenue generated, number of new customers acquired, or total transactions? And do you have a target for that number?

(We can refine your 500K visits/conversions target once we nail down your primary success metric)

Turn 5:
Perfect - we've got a solid foundation. 70,000 transactions at $180 AOV targeting 5x ROAS with $36 acquisition cost. The economics look achievable for athletic apparel.

Now let's move to audience definition. You mentioned active adults 25-45, but let's get more specific since tight targeting will be crucial to hit that $36 efficiency target.

Within that 25-45 age range, what type of active adult is most valuable to ActiveWear Pro? For example: serious athletes, casual fitness enthusiasts, weekend warriors, or people just starting their fitness journey?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Excellent - multi-activity fitness enthusiasts who value performance-style crossover and have spending power. That's a much tighter definition than general "active adults."

Let me add a few more targeting signals to sharpen this further. Within that fitness enthusiast segment, are there specific behavioral indicators that signal your best customers? 

For example: people who shop at premium athletic retailers, follow certain fitness influencers, use fitness apps regularly, or have specific lifestyle interests beyond just working out?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Perfect - that's a rich audience profile. Premium athletic shoppers who track workouts, follow wellness lifestyle content, and live that athleisure-to-brunch lifestyle. That behavioral targeting will be crucial for hitting your $36 efficiency target.

Now for geography - you mentioned US market. Are there specific regions, cities, or DMAs where ActiveWear Pro performs particularly well? Or should we plan for broad national coverage?

Some athletic apparel brands see stronger performance in fitness-conscious metros like LA, SF, NYC, Denver, or Austin versus more price-sensitive markets.

Turn 8:
Smart approach - concentrating 60-70% budget in high-performance metros will drive better efficiency than broad national coverage. Those markets align perfectly with your premium athleisure customer base.

Let me model this: 65% of $2.5M = $1.625M for your top metros (LA, SF, NYC, Denver, Austin, Seattle, Portland, Boston, DC plus Colorado/California markets). That leaves $875K for secondary markets or national reach.

In your top metros, you'll need tighter efficiency since competition is higher. Are you comfortable targeting around $32-35 per transaction in premium markets, knowing you might achieve $40-45 in secondary markets to average your $36 target?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Perfect - your geographic strategy balances efficiency with market opportunity. The economics are sound with built-in flexibility for optimization.

Now let's finalize your budget framework. You've got $2.5M total with 65% ($1.625M) for premium metros and 35% ($875K) for secondary markets. 

Within that $2.5M, how much are you planning to allocate toward acquisition versus retention? Some brands reserve 10-20% for existing customer reactivation and upselling, while others put everything toward new customer acquisition.

Given your goal of building the customer base long-term, what split makes sense for ActiveWear Pro?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Excellent allocation - $375K retention/$2.125M acquisition with higher AOV from existing customers. That 15% retention spend should generate disproportionate revenue given the $220-250 AOV versus $180 for new customers.

Let me update the math: $2.125M acquisition budget targeting 5x ROAS = $10.625M revenue from new customers. At $180 AOV, that's 59,000 new customer transactions at $36 each. Your retention budget should drive additional revenue at much better efficiency.

Now for value proposition - what's the core message that converts your target fitness enthusiasts? Is it performance technology, style versatility, quality durability, or something else that differentiates ActiveWear Pro from competitors like Lululemon and Athleta?

Turn 11:
Perfect positioning - "premium performance without the premium price" with that seamless gym-to-life versatility. That value prop should resonate strongly with your multi-activity fitness enthusiasts who want quality without Lululemon's price premium.

Now let's build your channel strategy. With $2.125M for acquisition targeting that performance-conscious audience across premium metros, we need channels that can deliver precise targeting and prove efficiency.

Given your audience shops at premium retailers and uses fitness apps, what channels are you currently using or considering? Are you leaning toward digital-first, or interested in mixing in some traditional media for brand building in those key metros?
