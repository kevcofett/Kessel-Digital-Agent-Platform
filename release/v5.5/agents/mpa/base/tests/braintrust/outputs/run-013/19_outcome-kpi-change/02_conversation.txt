TURN 1 (Step 1)

USER:
Hi, I'm Head of Marketing at TrustGuard Insurance. We need to build a media plan to drive 25,000 new policy acquisitions with a $5M budget. Our target is homeowners 35-65 with $100K+ household income, particularly those going through life events like buying a home, having a baby, or approaching retirement. LTV is around $2,800.

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by modeling your efficiency target. $5M ÷ 25,000 policies = $200 cost per acquisition. With $2,800 LTV, that's a 14:1 LTV:CAC ratio - very strong for insurance where 8-12:1 is typical.

Your primary business outcome is clear: 25,000 new policy acquisitions. How do you define a successful policy acquisition - is it when someone completes the application, makes first payment, or stays active for a certain period?

TURN 2 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We define a successful acquisition as when the policy is bound and the first premium payment is collected. That's when it becomes an active policy in our system and starts generating revenue. We typically see about 85% of applicants who start the process actually complete it and make that first payment, so we need to factor that conversion rate into our media planning.

AGENT:
Perfect. So we're targeting 25,000 bound policies with first payment collected. With your 85% completion rate, we need approximately 29,400 qualified applications to hit your target.

Let me update the efficiency math: $5M ÷ 29,400 applications = $170 cost per qualified application. That's aggressive but achievable for insurance - typical runs $200-300 for qualified apps in your demographic.

Your $200 cost per bound policy remains excellent at 14:1 LTV ratio.

Now for economics validation: with $2,800 LTV, what's your contribution margin on a new policy? This helps us confirm whether $200 acquisition cost supports profitable growth at scale.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 3 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
That math looks right - 29,400 applications to get our 25,000 bound policies. On contribution margin, I'd estimate we're looking at around 60-65% margin on that $2,800 LTV, so roughly $1,700-1,800 per policy after we account for claims, servicing costs, and overhead. With a $200 CAC, we're still in very healthy territory for profitable growth, especially since most of our policies renew annually and we see strong retention rates in that demographic.

AGENT:
Excellent. At 60-65% margin, you're looking at $1,700-1,800 contribution per policy against $200 acquisition cost. That's 8.5-9x payback on acquisition spend - very strong economics that support aggressive growth.

Your $170 cost per application target is definitely achievable with those unit economics. Insurance campaigns in your demographic typically see $200-300 per qualified app, so you're targeting about 15-30% better efficiency than market average. With your strong LTV and margins, this is realistic.

Economics look solid. Now let's define your audience more precisely. You mentioned homeowners 35-65 with $100K+ household income during life events. Which of these life events converts best for you historically - home purchase, new baby, or pre-retirement planning?

Events: benchmark_cited, step_transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 4 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Home purchase definitely converts best for us - that's when people are most actively thinking about protecting their new investment and often realize their existing coverage isn't adequate. New baby is solid too, especially for life insurance cross-sell opportunities. Pre-retirement planning tends to have longer consideration cycles and more price sensitivity, though the policy values can be higher when they do convert.

AGENT:
Great insight. Home purchase as your highest-converting life event gives us strong targeting precision. New baby as secondary priority makes sense for cross-sell expansion.

Let me assess audience sizing implications. Homeowners 35-65 with $100K+ income going through home purchase is a fairly narrow audience - likely 2-3M addressable nationally depending on geography. With $5M budget, we risk audience saturation within 8-12 weeks if we target too narrowly.

This suggests we'll need audience layering: primary focus on recent home buyers, secondary on new parents, with controlled expansion to broader homeowner audiences as we scale.

What geography are you targeting - national, specific regions, or metro areas where you're licensed to write policies?

TURN 5 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're licensed nationally and can write policies in all 50 states, so we're looking at a full national campaign. You're right about the audience sizing concern though - we've seen saturation issues in the past when we've gone too narrow too quickly. I like the audience layering approach you mentioned. We should probably start with recent home buyers in our primary tier, then expand to new parents and broader homeowner segments as we scale up the spend throughout the campaign.

AGENT:
Perfect. National reach with audience layering strategy addresses the saturation risk. Starting with recent home buyers, then expanding to new parents and broader homeowners gives us a clear scaling path.

With 2-3M recent home buyers nationally and your $5M budget, we can avoid saturation by geographic rotation and audience expansion timing. This supports your $170 cost per application target.

Now for budget structure: how do you want to allocate the $5M? Are you thinking equal monthly distribution over 12 months, or do you have seasonal preferences based on when home purchases peak or your business cycles?

TURN 6 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We definitely see seasonal patterns in our business. Spring and summer are our strongest periods - that's when home buying activity peaks, typically March through August. We'd probably want to weight about 60-65% of our budget toward those peak months. Maybe something like $500K per month during peak season and $300K during the slower fall/winter months. We also have some internal pressure to show strong Q2 and Q3 performance, so front-loading a bit toward the spring launch makes sense from a business perspective.

AGENT:
Smart seasonal approach. Let me model this out:

Peak months (Mar-Aug): 6 months × $500K = $3M
Off-peak months (Sep-Feb): 6 months × $300K = $1.8M
Total: $4.8M

That leaves $200K for contingency/optimization - perfect 4% buffer for competitive response and channel shifts.

During peak season at $500K/month, you're targeting ~2,900 applications monthly (17,400 total). Off-peak at $300K targets ~1,750 monthly (10,500 total). This pacing aligns well with home buying seasonality and gives you stronger Q2-Q3 performance.

The volume distribution also helps with audience management - higher spend during peak home buying season when your primary audience is most active.

Ready to move to value proposition development, or do you want to refine the budget allocation first?

TURN 7 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
That budget breakdown looks perfect - the $200K contingency buffer is smart given how competitive our space can get, especially during peak home buying season. The monthly application targets make sense too - 2,900 per month during peak season feels aggressive but achievable with the right channel mix.

Let's move on to value proposition development. I'm curious to see how we can differentiate TrustGuard from the major national carriers, especially since we're competing for the same high-value homeowner audience during their most active shopping periods.

AGENT:
Excellent. Now let's develop your competitive value proposition. With your strong unit economics and target efficiency, differentiation becomes crucial during peak home buying season when major carriers are also spending heavily.

For homeowners 35-65 with $100K+ income during life events, what's TrustGuard's primary competitive advantage? Is it pricing, coverage options, service experience, claims handling, or something else that sets you apart from State Farm, Allstate, and other nationals?

TURN 8 (Step 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our biggest differentiator is really our personalized service approach and specialized coverage options for high-value homes. While the big nationals treat everyone the same way, we focus specifically on affluent homeowners with properties that need more sophisticated coverage - things like guaranteed replacement cost, higher liability limits, and coverage for home offices or rental properties. 

We also have a dedicated claims team that knows these customers' needs, so when someone with a $800K home has a claim, they're not getting the same cookie-cutter experience as someone with a $150K property. Our pricing is competitive but not necessarily the lowest - we position ourselves as the premium option that's worth paying a bit more for when you have significant assets to protect.

AGENT:
Perfect positioning. "Premium protection for premium properties" with personalized service differentiates you clearly from national carriers' one-size-fits-all approach.

Your value proposition framework:
- **Specialized Coverage**: Guaranteed replacement cost, higher liability, home office/rental coverage
- **Service Premium**: Dedicated claims team that understands high-value properties  
- **Target-Specific**: Built for $800K+ homes, not $150K properties
- **Justified Premium**: Worth paying more when you have significant assets at risk

This messaging will resonate strongly with your $100K+ household income audience, especially recent home buyers who just made a major investment and want specialized protection.

For recent home buyers specifically, which pain point hits hardest - inadequate coverage from their previous insurer, or anxiety about protecting their new investment?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TURN 9 (Step 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
For recent home buyers, it's definitely the anxiety about protecting their new investment. Most of them are coming from apartments or smaller homes where they had basic renters or homeowners insurance that just doesn't cut it for a $600K-$800K property. They're realizing their old $300K coverage limit won't even cover half their new home's value, and they're worried about gaps they don't even know exist.

The inadequate previous coverage is more of a logical realization, but the anxiety about protecting what's probably their biggest financial investment ever - that's the emotional driver that gets them to actually take action and switch carriers.

AGENT:
Brilliant insight. Investment anxiety drives action more than coverage logic. Recent home buyers are emotionally vulnerable - they've just made their largest purchase and suddenly realize their protection is inadequate.

Your messaging should lead with that emotional hook: "Your biggest investment deserves specialized protection" rather than coverage feature lists. The anxiety about unknown gaps resonates perfectly with your specialized coverage strength.

For new parents (your secondary audience), is the emotional driver similar investment protection anxiety, or different - like protecting family security?
