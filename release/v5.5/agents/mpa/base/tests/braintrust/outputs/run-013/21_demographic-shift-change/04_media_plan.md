# Media Plan Output: Demographic Shift Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by checking your efficiency target. $1.5M ÷ 100K customers = $15 per customer acquisition cost. With $350 LTV, that's a 23:1 LTV:CAC ratio - extremely efficient and well above the 3:1 minimum for healthy unit economics.

For streetwear brands, typical CAC runs $25-50, so your $15 target is quite aggressive. To hit this, we'll need precise targeting and high-converting channels.

What specific business outcome are you prioritizing - is this purely about acquiring 100K new customers, or are you also focused on revenue targets or market share goals?

Turn 2:
You're right to question the $15 CAC - that's about 40% more efficient than typical streetwear acquisition costs. Based on industry benchmarks, streetwear brands typically see $25-50 CAC depending on channel mix and targeting precision.

Let me model a few scenarios:
- At $25 CAC: 100K customers = $2.5M budget (67% over your $1.5M)
- At $30 CAC: 100K customers = $3M budget (100% over your $1.5M)
- With your $1.5M budget at realistic $25-30 CAC: 50K-60K customers

To hit 100K customers with $1.5M, you'd need that aggressive $15 CAC. It's possible but requires tight audience targeting, strong creative performance, and channel optimization.

You have two paths: increase budget to $2.5M+ for realistic efficiency, or adjust target to 60K customers with current budget. The 60K path is more conservative and likely achievable.

Which direction feels right for your exec team's expectations - pushing for the aggressive efficiency or adjusting either budget or volume target?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
That's smart strategic thinking. The phased approach could work well - prove efficiency at 60K, then use performance data to justify additional budget for the remaining 40K.

For hitting aggressive $15 CAC, you'd need a few things to align:
- Strong first-party data for lookalike targeting (existing customer emails/purchases)
- High-converting organic content that reduces paid acquisition load
- Channels with lower CPMs (TikTok, Pinterest vs. Meta/Google)
- Excellent creative that drives high engagement rates

The benchmarks aren't necessarily conservative - they reflect what most brands achieve. But top-performing streetwear brands with strong organic presence and tight targeting do sometimes hit $15-20 CAC.

Do you have a solid email list or customer database for lookalike targeting? And how's your organic social presence - are you getting significant unpaid reach that could amplify paid efforts?

These factors would help me assess if $15 CAC is ambitious-but-achievable versus unrealistic for your situation.

Turn 4:
That changes things significantly! 40K past purchasers is excellent first-party data for lookalikes - that's your secret weapon. Strong organic presence with UGC means you're not starting from zero on awareness, which definitely helps efficiency.

With those assets, $15 CAC moves from "unrealistic" to "aggressive but possible." Top-performing streetwear brands with similar first-party data often hit $18-22 CAC, so you're pushing the envelope but not impossibly so.

The 75K email list also gives you a owned audience for retention, reducing pressure on paid acquisition to carry the full load.

Given this data, I'd recommend the phased approach: target 60K customers with your $1.5M as the conservative plan, but build the strategy assuming you could scale to 100K if performance hits that $15 CAC efficiency.

Before we dive into your audience strategy, what's your primary success metric - is it purely the customer count, or do you also track a revenue target that needs to hit alongside the 100K customers?

Turn 5:
Perfect! Customer count is the primary KPI, with that $8M revenue target as validation (which works out to $80 average first purchase - reasonable for streetwear). 

Now let's define your target audience more precisely. You mentioned Millennials 25-40 into streetwear and urban fashion in top 25 DMAs. With your aggressive $15 CAC target, we need tight audience definition to maximize efficiency.

A few questions to sharpen this:

Within that 25-40 age range, do you see stronger performance from younger Millennials (25-32) or older ones (33-40)? Your existing customer data might show which converts better.

Also, "into streetwear and urban fashion" is broad - are there specific lifestyle signals or interests that identify your highest-value customers beyond just fashion interest?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Excellent insights! That 25-32 focus with those behavioral signals gives us much tighter targeting. Sneaker culture and Supreme/Off-White followers are high-intent signals, and the creative/tech professional overlap suggests good disposable income.

Your audience definition is getting sharp: Millennials 25-32, sneaker enthusiasts, following streetwear brands/influencers, hip-hop music interest, creative/tech professionals, active on social sharing outfits.

Now for geography - you mentioned top 25 DMAs. Given streetwear culture concentrates in certain metros, some DMAs likely perform much better than others. 

From your existing customer data, which markets drive your highest volume and best conversion rates? I'm guessing places like LA, NYC, Atlanta, and maybe Chicago or SF perform well, but your data will show the real winners.

This will help us prioritize spend allocation across those 25 markets.

Turn 7:
Smart to identify those tiers! With your aggressive $15 CAC target, concentrating spend in proven markets makes the most sense. LA, NYC, and Atlanta likely have the audience density and cultural fit to drive efficient acquisition.

Let me help structure your top 25 DMAs with spend allocation strategy. Based on your performance data:

**Tier 1 (Heavy Investment):** LA, NYC, Atlanta - these should get 50-60% of your budget given they drive 30%+ of volume

**Tier 2 (Moderate Investment):** Chicago, SF, Miami, Dallas - solid conversion rates, meaningful volume

**Tier 3 (Test/Maintain):** Remaining DMAs like Seattle, Denver, DC - lighter spend to maintain presence and test

For your $1.5M budget, this might look like $750K-900K in Tier 1, $450K-600K in Tier 2, $150K-300K in Tier 3.

Before we build the detailed geography table, do you have any other DMAs in that top 25 list that perform well, or any you'd specifically want to test this year?

Turn 8:
Perfect! Let me lock in your geography strategy with those additions:

**Tier 1 (Heavy Investment - $750K-900K):** LA, NYC, Atlanta
**Tier 2 (Moderate Investment - $450K-600K):** Chicago, SF, Miami, Dallas, Boston, Philadelphia  
**Tier 3 (Test/Maintain - $150K-300K):** Phoenix, Las Vegas, plus Seattle, Denver, DC and remaining DMAs to reach your top 25

That's a solid 25-market strategy focusing 60% of budget on your three strongest markets while maintaining meaningful presence in 6 proven secondary markets and testing emerging opportunities.

This geographic foundation will drive efficient acquisition by concentrating spend where your audience density and conversion rates are highest.

Now let's move to Step 5 - Budget allocation. We've established your $1.5M total and geographic tiers. Next we need to determine how much goes to acquisition versus retention, and whether you're planning any brand awareness investment alongside performance marketing.

What percentage of that $1.5M should be pure new customer acquisition versus existing customer retention and engagement?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 9:
That 80-85% acquisition split makes perfect sense for your growth stage and 100K target. Let me model this:

**$1.5M Budget Allocation:**
- Acquisition: $1.275M (85%) 
- Retention: $225K (15%)

At your target $15 CAC: $1.275M ÷ $15 = 85K customers
At realistic $22 CAC: $1.275M ÷ $22 = 58K customers

You're right about acquisition doing double-duty for awareness, especially with your strong organic presence amplifying paid reach. The retention budget keeps your 40K existing customers engaged and generating UGC.

The math confirms you need that aggressive $15 CAC to hit 100K with this allocation. If performance trends toward $20+ CAC, you'd need to shift more budget from retention to acquisition or secure additional budget mid-year.

Now for your value proposition - what makes UrbanStyle Collective different from other streetwear brands? What's your core message that drives conversion with those 25-32 sneaker culture enthusiasts?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
That's a compelling value prop - "authentic street culture with accessible premium quality." The artist collaboration angle and local creative partnerships differentiate you from both corporate streetwear and impossible-to-get hype brands.

Your messaging framework is strong:
- **Authenticity:** Real street artists, genuine culture connection
- **Accessibility:** Premium quality without Supreme-level exclusivity  
- **Community:** Supporting local creatives, city-specific collaborations
- **Limited drops:** Hype factor with actual attainability

This resonates perfectly with your 25-32 audience who want cultural credibility and quality but aren't chasing $500 hoodies.

For campaigns, this suggests leading with artist stories and creative process content, showcasing the local connections, and emphasizing the "get it while you can" urgency without frustration.

Now let's move to Step 7 - Channels. With your $1.275M acquisition budget, strong first-party data, and authentic content story, we need to select channels that can hit that aggressive $15 CAC while reaching your sneaker culture audience efficiently.

What channels are you currently using, and which ones have performed best for customer acquisition?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Your current performance is solid - $18-20 CAC on Meta puts you in striking distance of that $15 target. With 40K past purchasers for lookalikes, Meta should remain a core channel.

TikTok is definitely worth scaling for your audience and CAC target. The platform skews younger (perfect for 25-32), has lower CPMs than Meta, and streetwear content performs exceptionally well there. Your authentic artist stories and drop culture fit TikTok's format perfectly.

For channel mix targeting $15 CAC, I'd recommend:
- **Meta (50-60%):** Your proven performer with strong lookalikes
- **TikTok (25-30%):** Scale testing with lower CPMs, younger audience
- **Google Search (10-15%):** Branded and high-intent streetwear terms
- **Influencer/Creator (10%):** Structured partnerships, not one-offs

The key is TikTok's creative-first approach - your artist collaboration content and limited drop announcements should perform well there. Plus Pinterest could be worth testing for streetwear inspiration content.

What's been holding you back from scaling TikTok - is it the creative production or the conversion tracking setup?
