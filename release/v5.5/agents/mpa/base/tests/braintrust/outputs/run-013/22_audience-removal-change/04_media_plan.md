# Media Plan Output: Audience Removal Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start - you've given me excellent detail. Let me quickly model what you've outlined: $4M ÷ 15,000 test drives = $267 per test drive. For automotive, that's quite aggressive - typical test drive costs run $300-500. This suggests we'll need precise targeting and efficient channels.

Before we dive deeper into economics, I want to clarify your primary business outcome. Are you optimizing for test drives as the end goal, or is the ultimate objective vehicle sales with test drives as the key conversion step?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 3:
Perfect! Let me update our model: 4,000 sales × $5,500 margin = $22M return on $4M spend = 5.5x ROAS. That's excellent unit economics for automotive.

However, I need to flag a feasibility concern. At $267 per test drive, you're targeting 47% below typical automotive benchmarks of $300-500. For premium EVs competing against German luxury, this is quite aggressive. 

To hit this efficiency, we'll need laser-focused targeting on your three segments and careful channel selection. The good news is your 2-4 week sales cycle means we'll see conversion data relatively quickly for optimization.

One key question: Do you have historical data from previous campaigns - either test drive costs or channel performance from other marketing efforts? This would significantly sharpen our projections and help validate whether $267 is achievable.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Excellent - that context changes everything. Your real objective is 3,500-4,500 vehicle sales, with test drives as the critical conversion mechanism. That 25-30% test drive to purchase rate is strong for automotive.

Let me reframe the economics: If you achieve 4,000 sales from 15,000 test drives, what's the average selling price or profit per vehicle? This will help us assess whether $267 per test drive creates profitable unit economics.

Also, what's your sales cycle typically look like from test drive to purchase - days, weeks, or months?

Turn 5:
Smart decision. Conservative efficiency targets with room to scale beats missing CPA goals on an ambitious launch. At $350 per test drive with 11,400 volume, you have a defensible plan with strong unit economics.

Now let's move to Step 3 - Audience. You mentioned three segments: eco-conscious early adopters 25-45, luxury buyers 45-65 switching from German sedans, and tech enthusiasts focused on features.

Of these three segments, which do you believe represents your highest-value customers or easiest conversion? Understanding the priority order will help us allocate budget and refine targeting precision for each group.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Based on your pilot data at $400 per test drive with broad targeting, I'd recommend modeling at $320-350 per test drive for this campaign. Here's why:

Your pilots show $400 is achievable without optimization. With your three well-defined segments and five-state focus, a 15-20% efficiency gain to $320-350 is realistic and still ambitious.

Let me show the math: At $350 per test drive, $4M gets you 11,400 test drives, projecting to 3,100-3,400 sales. That's still $17M-19M margin on $4M spend = 4.25-4.75x ROAS.

If you want to maintain the 15,000 test drive volume target, you'd need roughly $5.25M budget at $350 efficiency.

Which makes more sense for your launch: work within the $4M budget for ~11,400 test drives, or increase budget to hit the 15,000 volume target?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent prioritization. That suggests a budget weighting toward luxury switchers (highest value) and eco-conscious adopters (easiest conversion), with tech enthusiasts as your test-and-learn segment.

Let's define these segments more precisely for targeting. For your luxury German sedan switchers 45-65, what specific behavioral signals indicate they're ready to switch? Are we looking for people researching EVs, current BMW/Mercedes/Audi owners, or those showing other switching intent signals?

The more precise we can get on targeting signals, the better we can hit that $350 per test drive efficiency.

Turn 7:
Perfect targeting criteria. Current 3-Series/C-Class/A4 owners researching EVs is a highly specific, high-intent signal that should drive efficient conversions.

Now let's define your eco-conscious early adopters 25-45. Beyond age range, what behavioral and interest signals identify this segment? Are we looking for sustainability-focused consumers, renewable energy adopters, specific lifestyle indicators, or other green behavior patterns?

The more precisely we define each segment, the better we can optimize targeting and budget allocation across your three audiences.

Turn 8:
Excellent - those are actionable targeting signals. Solar owners, hybrid drivers, and green tech adopters show demonstrated behavior, not just stated values. That precision should drive strong efficiency.

Now for your tech enthusiasts segment - what specific technology behaviors and interests define this group beyond general feature focus? Are we targeting early adopters of specific tech categories, software professionals, or people who engage with particular types of tech content?

Understanding their tech engagement patterns will complete our audience framework and help us assess realistic targeting scale across all three segments.

Turn 9:
Perfect. Now I have clear targeting profiles for all three segments:

1. **Luxury switchers**: BMW/Mercedes/Audi owners + EV research behavior
2. **Eco-conscious adopters**: Solar/hybrid owners + demonstrated green purchasing  
3. **Tech enthusiasts**: Early tech adopters + automotive tech engagement

Moving to Step 4 - Geography. You mentioned California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Washington. Are these five states equally important, or should we prioritize certain markets? Also, within these large states, are there specific metro areas or regions that perform better for your brand?

Understanding geographic priorities will help optimize budget allocation and targeting precision within your chosen markets.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
That geographic weighting makes strategic sense. California at 40% aligns with EV infrastructure and adoption rates. Let me validate the allocation:

$4M budget × 40% = $1.6M for California across Bay Area, LA, San Diego. The remaining $2.4M split across Washington (Seattle), Texas (Austin/Houston), New York (NYC metro), and Florida (Miami/Tampa).

Given California's maturity and Florida's experimental status, should we weight the remaining 60% equally, or prioritize Washington and Texas over New York and Florida? Washington particularly seems like it should punch above equal weight given Seattle's tech concentration aligning with your audience segments.

Turn 11:
Perfect allocation - that weighting optimizes for market readiness and audience alignment. Let me confirm our geographic budget split:

- California (Bay Area, LA, San Diego): $1.6M (40%)
- Washington (Seattle): $800K (20%) 
- Texas (Austin, Houston): $600K (15%)
- New York (NYC metro): $600K (15%)
- Florida (Miami, Tampa): $400K (10%)

This prioritizes your strongest markets while giving Florida enough budget to generate meaningful test data.

Moving to Step 5 - Budget allocation by segment. Within each geographic market, how should we weight spending across your three audience segments? Should luxury switchers get the largest share since they're highest-value, or does the easier conversion of eco-conscious adopters suggest different weighting?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 12:
That 50/35/15 split is strategically sound - prioritizing highest-value while maintaining volume from easier conversions. Let me model what this means:

- Luxury switchers: $2M (50%) targeting ~5,700 test drives
- Eco-conscious adopters: $1.4M (35%) targeting ~4,000 test drives  
- Tech enthusiasts: $600K (15%) targeting ~1,700 test drives

The luxury focus makes sense given your $5,500 margin per sale. Even if luxury switchers convert at slightly lower rates than eco-conscious adopters, the lifetime value justifies the investment.

However, I'd recommend tracking performance by segment closely in the first 4-6 weeks. If eco-conscious adopters significantly outperform on efficiency, we can reallocate budget mid-campaign.

Now let's move to Step 6 - Value Proposition. How does your messaging differ across these three segments? What's the primary value proposition for each audience?
