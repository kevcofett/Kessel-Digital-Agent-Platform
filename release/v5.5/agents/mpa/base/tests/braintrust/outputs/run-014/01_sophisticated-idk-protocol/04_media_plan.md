# Media Plan Output: Sophisticated User - IDK Protocol

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

I can see you want to acquire 10,000 new users with $500K - that's $50 per user, which is efficient for fintech. Before we model feasibility, what's the primary business outcome you're trying to achieve? Are you focused on transaction volume, revenue growth, market share, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect - revenue growth through active remittance users is your objective. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success as a number. 

For remittance businesses, this could be total transaction volume (like $50M in transfers), revenue from fees (like $1.5M quarterly revenue), or average revenue per user. What specific number will tell you this campaign succeeded?

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Perfect. That 4:1 first-quarter return gives us a strong foundation. Since your tracking is still developing, I'll model using industry benchmarks and you can refine as your data improves.

Now let's move to Step 3 - defining your target audience. For remittance, user intent and sending frequency matter more than broad demographics. 

Who is your ideal customer? Are you targeting specific immigrant communities, particular income levels, people sending to certain countries, or other characteristics that indicate they'll be high-value senders?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it - $2M quarterly revenue from 10,000 new users means $200 average revenue per user. At typical 2-3% remittance take rates, that implies $6,700-10,000 in transaction volume per user quarterly.

Let me check the math on your efficiency target: $500K budget ÷ 10,000 users = $50 cost per customer. With $200 revenue per user, that's a 4:1 return in the first quarter alone - very strong for fintech.

This looks achievable. For remittance, $50 acquisition costs typically work when users have high transaction intent. The key will be targeting users who actually need to send money regularly, not just curious browsers.

Does this efficiency assessment align with what you're seeing in your current acquisition efforts?
