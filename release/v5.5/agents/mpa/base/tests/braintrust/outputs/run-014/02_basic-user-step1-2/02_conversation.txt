TURN 1 (Step 1)

USER:
Hi! I'm looking to get more people to buy shoes from our online store. Can you help me figure out the best way to do that?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What business outcome are you trying to achieve? Are you looking to get more customers, increase sales from existing customers, or something else?

TURN 2 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We definitely want more customers overall. Right now we're a newer online shoe brand, and we really need to get our name out there and start selling more shoes. I want to increase our total number of customers and total sales volume.

AGENT:
Perfect! So you want to grow your customer base and overall sales volume. 

To measure success, what number would tell you this campaign worked? For example, would you track total customers acquired, total revenue generated, or something else?

USER:
I want to get to maybe 5,000 new customers this year. We're pretty small right now, so that feels like a good target. Total sales would probably mean around $500,000 to $750,000 in new revenue from those customers.

AGENT:
Excellent! So 5,000 new customers generating $500K-$750K in revenue. That means each customer is worth about $100-150 on average, which is solid for online shoes.

What budget are you working with to acquire these 5,000 customers?

TURN 4 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We have about $250,000 to spend on marketing this year. I'm hoping we can stretch that to reach our customer acquisition goals.

AGENT:
Let me update our projections. $250,000 ÷ 5,000 customers = $50 per customer. 

That's quite aggressive - shoe retailers typically spend $60-100 per customer. You're targeting efficiency that's 17-50% better than market average. This is ambitious but possible with tight targeting and the right channel mix.

Do you know roughly what profit you make on each shoe sale? This helps us confirm whether $50 per customer makes sense for your business.

TURN 5 (Step 2)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
To be honest, I'm not totally sure about our exact profit per shoe. We have different styles that sell at different prices, and I know our margins vary. I think we make somewhere between $30-50 on most of our shoes, but I'd have to check with our finance team to get a precise number.

AGENT:
Got it. For shoe retailers, profit margins typically run 40-50%. Let me model using 45% margin on your $100-150 average order value. That suggests roughly $45-68 profit per customer. You can adjust anytime.

At $50 cost per customer against $45-68 profit, your efficiency target is tight but workable. To hit 5,000 customers at $50 each, we'll need precise audience targeting and efficient channels.

Now let's define who you're trying to reach. What does your ideal shoe customer look like?

TURN 6 (Step 2)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Well, our shoes are mostly for young professionals who care about style and comfort. I think they're mostly between 25 and 40 years old, live in cities, and have some disposable income. They probably want shoes that look good for work but are also comfortable enough to walk around in. I know they're probably active and care about how they look, but I don't have super specific demographic details yet.

AGENT:
Perfect! Young urban professionals, 25-40, who value style-comfort combination for work and city life. That's a strong foundation.

A couple of key details to sharpen our targeting: Are you focusing more on men, women, or both? And when you say "cities," are you thinking major metros like NYC, LA, Chicago, or also including smaller urban areas?
