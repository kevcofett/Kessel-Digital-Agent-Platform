# Media Plan Output: High-Stakes Performance Campaign

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business outcome. You mentioned acquiring 50,000 new merchants - is merchant acquisition your primary objective, or are there other business outcomes you're trying to achieve alongside this?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your primary objective is merchant acquisition with a focus on quality and unit economics improvement. For measuring success, it sounds like you have multiple important metrics - the 50,000 merchant count, ARR growth, and transaction volume quality.

Which single metric should we use as the primary KPI to define campaign success? Is it the 50,000 merchant target, a specific ARR growth number, or something else that best captures quality merchant acquisition?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent. So your primary KPI is acquiring 50,000 merchants processing at least $25K monthly - that quality filter ensures strong unit economics while hitting volume targets.

Let me check the efficiency implications. With your $2M budget targeting 50,000 merchants, that's $40 per merchant acquisition cost. Given your $850 LTV, that's a 21:1 LTV:CAC ratio - extremely strong unit economics.

However, $40 CAC is quite aggressive for B2B fintech. Typical merchant acquisition costs run $150-400 depending on segment and processing volume requirements. Your target is 73% below typical benchmarks.

This is ambitious but achievable with precise targeting and channel efficiency. To hit $40 CAC for quality merchants, we'll need tight audience definition and optimized channel selection.

Does this efficiency target feel realistic based on your current acquisition experience, or should we model scenarios with higher CAC assumptions?

Turn 4:
Got it. Your confidence in targeting is well-founded - leveraging payment processors and accountants as referral networks is smart distribution strategy. Let me model both scenarios.

**Aggressive case ($40 CAC):** $2M budget hits exactly 50,000 merchants
**Conservative case ($60-80 CAC):** At $70 average, you'd acquire ~28,500 merchants, requiring either $3.5M budget or reduced volume target

Both scenarios maintain strong unit economics with your $850 LTV. The key success factor will be audience precision - reaching small businesses actively seeking payment solutions through your referral network connections.

Your current LinkedIn and Google performance gives good validation for the aggressive target. Step 2 economics look solid.

Now let's define your target audience. You mentioned small businesses, payment processors, and accountants as key segments. What specific characteristics define your ideal merchant beyond the $25K monthly processing threshold?

Turn 5:
Perfect audience definition. B2B service businesses with 5-50 employees in major metros creates a focused, high-value segment. The tech-forward profile using cloud accounting software is excellent for targeting precision.

Let me assess the audience implications. Your target profile - professional services, $500K-$5M revenue, tech-forward in major metros - likely represents 200K-400K addressable businesses across your target markets. With 50,000 acquisition target, you're aiming for 12-25% market penetration, which is aggressive but achievable over 12 months with strong execution.

The cloud accounting software usage is particularly valuable for targeting - gives clear behavioral signals for programmatic and LinkedIn targeting.

What's your geographic priority? Should we focus budget on proven markets like SF/NYC first, or split evenly between established and emerging markets like Austin/Denver?

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent strategic split. 70% in established markets ($1.4M) provides volume foundation, while 30% in emerging markets ($600K) captures high-growth opportunity at potentially lower competition levels.

Let me model the geographic efficiency:

**Established markets (SF/NYC/Chicago):** $1.4M targeting ~35,000 merchants = $40 CAC
**Emerging markets (Austin/Denver):** $600K targeting ~15,000 merchants = $40 CAC

The emerging markets allocation is smart - Austin and Denver tech scenes are maturing rapidly with less saturated B2B fintech competition. Your efficiency target becomes more achievable when 30% of volume comes from these lower-competition markets.

Now let's validate your total budget. You have $2M allocated for 50,000 merchants. Is this your total marketing budget, or do you have additional budget for retention, expansion, or other growth initiatives?

Turn 7:
Perfect. $2M focused purely on acquisition with an additional $500K for retention shows strong strategic thinking. That retention budget will be crucial for protecting your $850 LTV assumption and driving expansion revenue.

Your $2.5M total investment targeting 50,000 merchants at $850 LTV projects $42.5M in total merchant value - a 17:1 return on total marketing investment. That's excellent unit economics for B2B fintech.

Now let's develop your value proposition. Given your target of tech-forward professional services firms using cloud accounting, what's your primary competitive advantage? Is it integration capabilities, pricing, payment flexibility, or something else that resonates most with this audience?
