# Media Plan Output: Full 10-Step Media Planning

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with some quick math on your targets. $750K ÷ 15,000 customers = $50 per customer acquisition cost. For home decor, typical CAC runs $60-100, so you're targeting 17-50% better efficiency than market average - that's aggressive but achievable with tight execution.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 15,000 new customers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your objective is customer acquisition to drive revenue growth and build a base for repeat purchases. 

To define success clearly, what's your primary KPI - the main number you'll track to measure if this campaign succeeds? For example, is it the 15,000 new customers, total revenue from those customers, or something else?

Turn 3:
Got it - total revenue from new customers is your primary KPI, with LTV as secondary focus. That's smart for building sustainable growth.

What revenue target are you aiming for from these 15,000 new customers? This will help us assess if your $50 cost per customer aligns with your profitability goals.

Turn 4:
Excellent. Let me update our projections. $2.25M from 15,000 customers = $150 average revenue per customer. Since your AOV is $150, you're expecting each new customer to purchase exactly once on average to hit your target.

For home decor with typical 40-50% margins, your $50 CAC against $150 AOV looks strong if margins hold. However, expecting only one purchase per customer seems conservative given your LTV focus.

Is $150 your first-purchase AOV, or your expected total spend per customer over the full year?

Turn 5:
Perfect! Let me recalculate with the realistic repeat purchase expectation. If customers spend $375-450 annually (2.5-3x your $150 AOV), your revenue target should be $5.6M-6.8M, not $2.25M.

At $50 CAC against $375-450 customer value with 45% margins, you're looking at $169-203 gross profit per customer. That's a 3.4-4.1x return on ad spend - very healthy economics.

Your $50 CAC target is actually quite reasonable when viewed against realistic customer value rather than single purchase. This gives us a solid foundation.

Now let's move to Step 2 - Economics. What's your typical gross margin on home decor products?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Let me update our economics with 37.5% blended margin. At $375-450 annual customer value with 37.5% margin, you're generating $141-169 gross profit per customer against your $50 acquisition cost. That's a 2.8-3.4x efficiency ratio - solid for home decor.

Your $50 CAC target is realistic and profitable. The math works: you can afford to acquire customers at this cost and maintain healthy unit economics.

Step 2 complete - your efficiency targets are achievable. Now let's define your audience in Step 3.

Who is your ideal customer for home decor? What demographics and behaviors define your best buyers?

Turn 7:
Great audience definition. Homeowners 30-55, middle to upper-middle class, design-conscious professionals in urban/suburban areas who are furnishing new spaces or updating existing ones.

For targeting precision, what household income range defines your sweet spot? And are there specific life events or behaviors that signal when someone is most likely to purchase from you - like recent moves, home purchases, or seasonal decorating?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Perfect targeting framework. $85K-175K income, life transitions (marriage, home purchase, new child, promotion), plus seasonal refresh moments in spring/fall.

Are there any specific interests, shopping behaviors, or lifestyle signals that help you identify these design-conscious customers? For example, do they follow home design influencers, shop at certain retailers, or engage with particular types of content?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Excellent behavioral profile. Design-conscious customers who research extensively, follow home design influencers on Pinterest/Instagram, engage with premium home brands, and consume design content across multiple channels.

This gives us strong targeting signals: Pinterest/Instagram engagement, home design content consumption, competitor brand affinity, and research-driven purchase behavior.

Step 3 complete - we have a clear audience profile. Moving to Step 4 - Geography.

What geographic markets are you targeting? Are you focused nationally, or do you have specific regions or metro areas that perform best for HomeStyle Decor?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 10:
Perfect geographic focus. Major metros (NYC, Chicago, SF, Seattle) with strong performance among urban/suburban professionals, plus nationwide shipping capability.

Those metros align well with your $85K-175K income targets and design-conscious audience. High-income urban markets typically have better conversion rates for premium home decor.

Are there any other top-performing metro areas you'd want to prioritize, or should we focus the majority of budget on those four core markets while maintaining lighter national coverage?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 11:
Excellent. Six core metros (NYC, Chicago, SF, Seattle, Atlanta, Boston) with 70% of budget, 30% for broader national coverage. That concentration strategy should maximize efficiency in your proven markets.

Step 4 complete - we have clear geographic priorities. Moving to Step 5 - Budget.

With your $750K total budget and 70/30 geographic split, that's $525K for core metros and $225K national. How do you want to allocate budget across the customer acquisition funnel - what percentage for prospecting new customers versus retargeting and retention?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 10: Risks

Turn 12:
Perfect allocation strategy. 60% prospecting ($450K) and 40% retention/retargeting ($300K) aligns well with your new customer acquisition goals while building the repeat purchase behavior you want.

Let me check the math: $450K for prospecting ÷ 15,000 customers = $30 per customer for acquisition, with an additional $20 per customer for retention efforts. That's efficient and leaves room for nurturing the repeat purchases that drive your $375-450 annual customer value.

Step 5 complete - budget allocation is set. Moving to Step 6 - Value Proposition.

What's your core value proposition that differentiates HomeStyle Decor from competitors like West Elm and Crate & Barrel? What makes design-conscious customers choose you?
