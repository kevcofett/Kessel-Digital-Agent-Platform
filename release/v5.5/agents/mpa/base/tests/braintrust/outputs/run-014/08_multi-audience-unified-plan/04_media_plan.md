# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience Unified Media Plan

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build this media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start - you've given me strong segment definitions and a clear volume target. Let me update our projections: $3M ÷ 25,000 enrollees = $120 per customer acquisition cost. For health insurance, this is aggressive - typical runs $150-250 based on industry benchmarks. To hit $120, we'll need precise targeting and efficient channel mix.

You mentioned "new enrollees" as your goal. What's the primary business outcome you're trying to achieve - is this about hitting enrollment quotas, revenue targets, or market share growth in specific segments?

Turn 3:
Perfect - enrollment volume as your primary KPI with 15-20% market share growth target. That translates to pushing from 8-10% to 12-15% share in younger segments.

Let me validate the economics. At $120 per enrollee with your $3M budget targeting 25,000 customers, you're 20-52% below typical health insurance acquisition costs of $150-250. This is ambitious but achievable with tight targeting.

What's the average annual premium value per enrollee for these segments? Understanding customer lifetime value will help us assess if $120 acquisition cost creates profitable growth or if we need to adjust targets.

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Got it - market share growth in younger segments while defending your pre-Medicare position. That's a clear strategic objective.

For measuring success, what's your primary KPI? Are you tracking market share percentage directly, or would you measure this through enrollment volume, brand awareness lift, or another metric? And do you have a specific market share target you're aiming to hit in those younger segments?

Turn 5:
Perfect targeting signals - those behavioral indicators will help us reach the right young professionals efficiently. The wellness lifestyle approach makes sense for this segment.

For the Family segment (35-50, suburban) - what signals beyond "parents with kids under 18" help identify families most concerned about comprehensive coverage and cost predictability? Are there specific parenting behaviors, school district characteristics, or family activity patterns that correlate with your best family customers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Excellent - your LTV:CAC ratios look strong. Young professionals and families at $10K-14K LTV versus $120 CAC gives you 83:1 to 120:1 ratios, well above the 3:1 minimum threshold. Pre-Medicare is even stronger.

Got it that you'll model using these estimates and refine retention tracking. Moving on to audience definition.

You've given me solid demographic frameworks for each segment. Let's get more precise on targeting signals. Starting with Young Professionals (26-35, urban metros) - beyond gym membership, what behavioral signals help identify health-conscious prospects? Things like fitness app usage, organic food purchasing, wellness content consumption, or specific lifestyle indicators?

Turn 6:
Excellent - those planning-focused behaviors and income brackets give us precise targeting. The back-to-school timing insight is valuable for campaign pacing.

For Pre-Medicare (55-64) - you mentioned they're focused on stability, network quality, and Medicare transition. What specific signals identify the prospects most likely to value continuity with TrueHealth versus switching to competitors? Are there retirement planning behaviors, healthcare usage patterns, or information-seeking activities that correlate with your best pre-Medicare customers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Perfect - you've given me strong behavioral signals for all three segments. This gives us precise targeting beyond basic demographics.

Now for geography. You mentioned urban metros for Young Professionals, suburban markets around top 50 metros for Families, and national with FL/AZ/TX concentration for Pre-Medicare. 

Within those Young Professional metros (NYC, SF, LA, Chicago), are there specific neighborhoods or zip codes that perform best? And for the Family suburban targeting - any particular suburban markets or distance radiuses from metro centers that show stronger conversion rates?

Turn 8:
Excellent geographic precision - those specific neighborhoods and suburban rings will significantly improve targeting efficiency.

Let me model your budget allocation. With $3M total and three distinct segments requiring different approaches:

**Quick feasibility check:** 
- Young Professionals: High-value neighborhoods, premium targeting = higher CPMs
- Families: Suburban efficiency, established behaviors = moderate costs  
- Pre-Medicare: Broader reach, educational content = mixed efficiency

Do you have initial thoughts on budget split across the three segments, or should we model based on your growth priorities? Since you're defending Pre-Medicare position while growing the other two, I'd expect heavier allocation toward Young Professionals and Families.

Turn 9:
Let me update our projections with your allocation:

**Budget Breakdown:**
- Young Professionals: $900K ÷ target customers = need customer target per segment
- Families: $600K ÷ target customers = need customer target per segment  
- Pre-Medicare: $1.5M ÷ target customers = need customer target per segment

Before I can assess efficiency by segment, how are you splitting your 25,000 total enrollment target across the three segments? Given your growth focus on younger demographics versus defending Pre-Medicare position, what's your target breakdown?

Turn 10:
Perfect, let me calculate the efficiency by segment:

**Segment Economics:**
- Young Professionals: $900K ÷ 12,000 = $75 per enrollee
- Families: $600K ÷ 8,000 = $75 per enrollee  
- Pre-Medicare: $1.5M ÷ 5,000 = $300 per enrollee

This reveals an interesting dynamic. Your growth segments (Young Professionals and Families) are targeting $75 acquisition costs - 50% below typical health insurance benchmarks. That's aggressive but potentially achievable with your precise behavioral targeting.

Pre-Medicare at $300 is above typical range, which makes sense for a defensive strategy with higher lifetime value customers.

The $75 targets require exceptional efficiency. Given the premium targeting areas (Williamsburg, Mission District) typically have 2-3x higher CPMs, are you confident this efficiency is realistic, or should we adjust the allocation?

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 11:
Understood - you're betting on precision targeting to overcome premium CPM challenges. Smart approach, and the ability to pivot quickly will be key.

Now let's develop your value propositions. Given your research insights, each segment needs distinct messaging.

For Young Professionals in those wellness-focused neighborhoods, you mentioned wanting "holistic wellness positioning" rather than traditional insurance messaging. What specific value proposition resonates most with this segment? Is it convenience and digital experience, wellness integration, or something else that differentiates TrueHealth from competitors?

Turn 12:
Perfect - that wellness ecosystem positioning aligns well with their behavioral signals. "Health optimization partner" versus traditional insurance protection is a strong differentiation.

For Families in those suburban markets with 529 plans and comprehensive planning mindsets, what value proposition resonates most? Given their focus on long-term planning and cost predictability, how does TrueHealth position itself differently from competitors for this segment?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 13:
Excellent - "family financial health guardian" with predictable costs speaks directly to their planning-focused mindset and 529-saving behaviors.

For Pre-Medicare (55-64), given their focus on stability, network quality, and Medicare transition planning, what's your value proposition? How does TrueHealth position itself as the bridge to Medicare while maintaining their current provider relationships?

Turn 14:
Perfect - "trusted transition partner" with continuity focus addresses their core concerns about stability and network preservation.

Now let's move to channels. With three distinct segments requiring different approaches and your aggressive $75 efficiency targets for younger segments, we need strategic channel selection.

Given Young Professionals' digital-native behavior and premium urban targeting, what channels are you considering? Your wellness ecosystem positioning and behavioral signals (Strava, meditation apps, wellness influencers) suggest specific digital environments where this audience naturally engages.
