# Media Plan Output: Precision Targeting with Complex Attributes

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've provided excellent detail upfront. Let me immediately model what you've shared:

**Initial Feasibility Check:**
$1.5M ÷ 2,500 leads = $600 cost per lead

For HNW financial services, this is aggressive but achievable. Typical qualified lead costs run $800-1,200 based on industry benchmarks, so you're targeting 25-50% better efficiency than market average.

Given your sophisticated audience (executives with $1M+ investable assets) and competitive landscape, hitting $600 per qualified lead will require precise targeting and premium channel execution.

Your business outcome is clear: acquire 2,500 qualified leads from high-net-worth prospects. What specific action defines a "qualified lead" for LuxeFinance - is it booking a consultation, completing a financial assessment, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect. Your qualified lead is a booked 45-minute wealth consultation - that's a strong conversion event showing genuine intent.

Let me update the economics. At $600 per consultation booking, you're targeting premium efficiency for wealth management. This is achievable with your sophisticated targeting approach.

Now for the critical economics question: What's the typical client value from these consultations? If you convert 30% of consultations to clients with average $2M AUM at 1% management fee, that's roughly $6,000 annual value per converted client, making your $600 cost very reasonable.

Do you have data on your consultation-to-client conversion rate and average AUM per new client?

Turn 4:
Perfect behavioral intelligence. You've identified the digital breadcrumbs that signal wealth transition moments - that's sophisticated audience strategy.

**Audience Precision Signals:**
- Financial research: retirement calculators, stock option strategies, tax optimization content
- Professional transitions: LinkedIn profile updates, succession planning content
- Liquidity events: business sales, IPOs, acquisitions
- Active education: white paper downloads, strategic wealth content engagement

This level of behavioral targeting should significantly improve your $600 cost per consultation feasibility. You're not just targeting demographics - you're targeting intent and life moments.

One critical question for modeling reach: Among your 50K existing clients, what percentage came from each behavioral signal type? This helps us estimate audience sizing and prioritize which signals drive highest-converting prospects.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent economics! Let me validate this:

**Updated Model:**
- 2,500 consultations × 37.5% conversion = 937 new clients
- 937 clients × $29,750 annual revenue = $27.9M first-year revenue
- $27.9M revenue ÷ $1.5M ad spend = 18.6x first-year ROAS

Your $600 cost per consultation is extremely conservative given these unit economics. With $29,750 annual client value, you could theoretically spend up to $11,000 per consultation and still achieve 2.5x first-year return.

This creates strategic flexibility - you can prioritize quality over efficiency, target premium placements, and compete aggressively for the best prospects.

Your economics are solid. Now let's define your precise audience. You mentioned executives and business owners 45-65 with $1M+ investable assets. What behavioral signals beyond demographics help identify prospects approaching retirement or major liquidity events?

Turn 5:
Excellent data-driven insight. Let me model this for targeting priority:

**Behavioral Signal Prioritization:**
- Liquidity events (45% of clients, highest LTV): Primary targeting weight
- Professional transitions (30%): Secondary focus  
- Financial research (25%): Tertiary but still valuable

This creates a smart tiered approach - allocate 50-60% of budget toward liquidity event signals where you see both volume and quality, then layer in the other signals.

Now for geography. You mentioned top HNW DMAs: NYC, SF, LA, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Denver, Miami, Dallas, DC. 

Given your liquidity event focus, do you see geographic concentration differences? For example, do tech liquidity events cluster more in SF/Seattle while financial services exits concentrate in NYC? This could help us allocate your $1.5M budget across these ten markets.

Turn 6:
Perfect geographic intelligence. Let me model this allocation:

**Primary Markets (50-60% of $1.5M budget):**
- SF Bay Area: Tech exits, startup acquisitions - $300-400K
- NYC Metro: Financial services, PE, hedge fund events - $300-400K  
- Boston: B2B enterprise sales - $150-200K

**Secondary Markets (40-50% remaining):**
- LA, Chicago, Seattle, Denver, Miami, Dallas, DC: $150-200K combined

This concentration strategy aligns budget with your highest-converting behavioral signals and geographic clusters.

Your audience strategy is sophisticated and data-backed. You have behavioral targeting tied to wealth transition moments, geographic concentration based on liquidity event patterns, and 50K first-party records for lookalike modeling.

Ready to move to budget allocation? We need to determine how to distribute your $1.5M across acquisition channels, retargeting, and potential testing budget.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 8:
Powerful value proposition. "Family office approach for $1M+ clients" is compelling differentiation - you're democratizing UHNW services.

**Key Messaging Pillars:**
- Proactive wealth preservation vs. reactive asset management
- 22-year average advisor experience = credibility with sophisticated prospects
- Immediate tax savings demonstration = tangible ROI proof
- Multi-generational strategic planning = long-term thinking

This positioning should resonate strongly with your behavioral targeting - executives facing liquidity events need exactly this level of strategic sophistication.

Ready for channel strategy? With your $1.05-1.125M acquisition budget, we need to determine optimal allocation across LinkedIn, Programmatic Display, CTV, and Financial Publisher Direct. Each channel has different strengths for reaching your behavioral signals.

Which channel do you want to anchor as your primary driver - LinkedIn for professional transitions or Programmatic for liquidity event targeting?

Turn 9:
Excellent strategic focus. Let me model your channel allocation:

**Primary Channel - LinkedIn (40-45% of acquisition):**
- Budget: $420-505K of $1.05M acquisition budget
- Target: ~700-840 consultations at $600-720 CPL
- Leverage: Professional transitions, leadership titles, company events
- Creative: Thought leadership content, strategic wealth insights

**Secondary Channel Mix (55-60% remaining):**
- Programmatic Display: $315-380K for liquidity event behavioral targeting
- CTV: $210-250K for affluent household reach
- Financial Publisher Direct: $105-125K for active research capture

LinkedIn's precision targeting for executives experiencing transitions is your competitive advantage. The platform's professional context builds immediate credibility with sophisticated prospects.

For measurement, what attribution model works best for your long sales cycle? These prospects likely research extensively before booking consultations - do you track multi-touch attribution or focus on last-click given the high consideration purchase?

Turn 10:
Smart attribution approach. Your 30/40/30 weighting across research, consideration, and conversion properly values the extended HNW decision journey.

**Measurement Framework:**
- Research stage (30%): LinkedIn thought leadership, CTV brand exposure, financial publisher content
- Consideration stage (40%): Retargeting sequences, consultation booking content, advisor credibility assets  
- Conversion stage (30%): Direct response, consultation scheduling, final decision drivers

This model will help optimize your channel mix - LinkedIn and CTV build research awareness, Programmatic Display nurtures consideration, and retargeting drives conversion.

For testing strategy with your $75-150K experimental budget, what's your priority? Testing new behavioral signals, exploring emerging channels like Reddit or Quora for wealth discussions, or validating creative approaches for your sophisticated audience?

Turn 12:
Perfect risk management approach. Let me summarize your complete media plan:

**LUXEFINANCE HNW ACQUISITION PLAN**
- **Objective**: 2,500 wealth consultations at $600 CPL ($1.5M budget)
- **Economics**: 37.5% conversion to $29,750 annual clients = 18.6x first-year ROAS
- **Primary Markets**: SF Bay Area, NYC Metro, Boston (50-60% budget concentration)
- **Channel Strategy**: LinkedIn primary (40-45%), Programmatic/CTV/Publishers secondary
- **Attribution**: 30/40/30 multi-touch weighting across research/consideration/conversion
- **Testing**: $75-150K for Reddit/Quora channels + sophisticated creative

**Risk Mitigation Framework:**
- 20-25% budget reallocation capability across behavioral signals
- Pivot readiness: liquidity events → retirement planning/tax optimization
- First-party data advantage for rapid lookalike recalibration
- Geographic flexibility to shift from primary to secondary markets

Your plan balances precision targeting with strategic flexibility. The strong unit economics provide cushion for market volatility, and your sophisticated audience strategy should deliver quality prospects even in challenging conditions.

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Excellent allocation strategy. Let me model this:

**Budget Allocation ($1.5M total):**
- Acquisition (70-75%): $1.05-1.125M for LinkedIn, Programmatic Display, CTV, Financial Publishers
- Retargeting (15-20%): $225-300K to nurture prospects who engaged but didn't convert
- Testing/Experimental (5-10%): $75-150K for new channel validation

Your channel selection is smart for HNW targeting. LinkedIn excels at professional transition signals, Programmatic Display can leverage your 50K client lookalikes, CTV reaches affluent households, and Financial Publisher Direct captures active research behavior.

The 50K first-party dataset gives you significant lookalike modeling power - that's a substantial advantage for precision targeting.

Now for your value proposition. With sophisticated HNW prospects researching multiple wealth management firms, what specific positioning differentiates LuxeFinance? Is it your tax optimization expertise, comprehensive estate planning approach, or something else that wins these high-stakes decisions?

Turn 11:
Excellent testing strategy. Let me model this:

**Testing Budget Allocation ($75-150K):**
- Emerging Channels (60%): $45-90K for Reddit/Quora
  - Professional subreddits: r/financialindependence, r/investing, r/entrepreneur
  - Quora: Executive transition, tax optimization, wealth strategy topics
- Creative Testing (40%): $30-60K for sophisticated messaging
  - Strategic wealth content vs. generic financial messaging
  - Executive-level problem framing vs. mass market approaches

Finally, let's address risks. Your biggest threats are likely audience saturation in premium DMAs, competitive bidding wars for HNW prospects, and potential economic headwinds affecting liquidity events. 

What contingency planning do you want built into this plan? Should we model scenarios where your $600 CPL target faces upward pressure, or where liquidity event volume decreases in a market downturn?

Turn 13:
Excellent. Your plan is strategically sound and operationally ready for execution.

**Implementation Priority:**
- Week 1-2: LinkedIn campaign setup with professional transition targeting
- Week 3-4: Programmatic Display launch with liquidity event behavioral signals
- 90-day checkpoint: Validate behavioral signal performance and optimize allocation

Your 90-day tracking focus on LinkedIn and Programmatic Display will provide critical data on which behavioral signals drive highest consultation quality. The strong unit economics give you room to optimize without efficiency pressure.

Key success metrics to monitor:
- Consultation booking rate by behavioral signal type
- Cost per consultation trending toward $600 target
- Geographic performance to validate market concentration strategy
