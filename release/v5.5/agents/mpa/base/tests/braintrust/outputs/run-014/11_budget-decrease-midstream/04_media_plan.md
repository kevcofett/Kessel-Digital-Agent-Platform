# Media Plan Output: Budget Decrease Midstream

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by modeling your efficiency target. With $1M budget targeting 500 qualified opportunities, that's $2,000 per opportunity. For enterprise data infrastructure targeting large companies, this is aggressive - typical runs $3,000-5,000 per qualified opportunity based on the complexity and deal size.

To hit $2,000 efficiency with $150K average deals, we'll need precise targeting and likely account-based approaches. Is generating 500 qualified opportunities your primary success metric, or do you also track pipeline value or closed deals as key outcomes?

Turn 2:
Perfect. $75M pipeline value at $2,000 per opportunity is ambitious but achievable with tight ABM execution. Your deal size supports the investment in precision targeting.

Let me confirm Step 1 completion: Your objective is generating 500 qualified opportunities, primary KPI is opportunities created, and target volume is 500. 

Now for economics validation - you mentioned strong ABM tactics. What's your typical opportunity-to-close rate? This helps us assess if the $2,000 efficiency supports your broader unit economics, especially since enterprise sales cycles can be long and complex.

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent. At 20-25% close rate, you're projecting $15-18.75M in revenue from $1M media spend - that's 15-19x return, which strongly supports the $2,000 per opportunity target despite being aggressive for the market.

Your 6-9 month sales cycle reinforces why precision targeting is critical. The long consideration window means we need to reach the right accounts consistently without waste.

Economics look solid. Moving to Step 3 - Audience definition.

You mentioned enterprise companies 5000+ employees targeting data and IT leaders. Within that universe, are there specific verticals or use cases where DataScale performs particularly well? This helps us prioritize within your broad ICP.

Turn 4:
Perfect - financial services as primary with tech/telecom as secondary gives us clear prioritization. The multi-cloud data consolidation use case is a strong targeting signal.

For your data and IT leader targeting, which specific roles convert best to qualified opportunities? Are we talking Chief Data Officers, VPs of Engineering, Data Engineering Directors, or does it vary by company size and vertical?

This precision matters for ABM efficiency - the tighter we can define decision-makers and influencers, the better we can optimize that aggressive $2,000 target.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Excellent. That gives us precise targeting: VPs/Directors of Data Engineering and CDOs in financial services, plus Data Infrastructure VPs and Senior Data Architects in tech. The pain point around data fragmentation is a strong behavioral signal.

Let me size this audience quickly. Financial services companies 5000+ employees with these titles, plus tech/telecom - we're likely looking at 15,000-25,000 targetable contacts across your key verticals. That's a focused universe for ABM, which supports your efficiency target.

Moving to Step 4 - Geography. Are you targeting specific regions, or is this a global campaign? Enterprise data infrastructure often has geographic compliance considerations that might influence where you focus.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 6:
Perfect - US, UK, and Germany with concentration in financial centers makes sense for enterprise data infrastructure. Those markets have the regulatory complexity and technical sophistication that drives demand for your solution.

The geographic focus on financial hubs aligns well with your financial services vertical priority. This concentrated approach will help maximize your ABM efficiency.

Moving to Step 5 - Budget allocation. With $1M total budget across three countries targeting financial centers, how are you thinking about geographic split? Should we weight toward the US market, or distribute more evenly across the three regions?

Turn 7:
Perfect. $600-650K US, $250K UK, $100-150K Germany aligns with market opportunity and your customer concentration.

Let me validate this split: US gets the lion's share for scale, UK maintains strong presence in London financial district, and Germany gets meaningful but focused investment in Frankfurt. This weighting matches where enterprise data transformation budgets typically concentrate.

Moving to Step 6 - Value Proposition. You mentioned data fragmentation pain points. For your ABM messaging, what's the primary business outcome these technical leaders care most about? Is it cost reduction from consolidation, faster time-to-insight, regulatory compliance efficiency, or something else that resonates strongest in your sales conversations?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
Excellent - "accelerating analytics and AI initiatives" with 40-50% overhead reduction is compelling and quantifiable. Technical leaders understand that speed advantage directly impacts competitive positioning.

The time-to-insight focus is perfect for ABM messaging - it's outcome-focused rather than feature-focused, which resonates with senior technical decision-makers feeling pressure to deliver faster.

Moving to Step 7 - Channels. Given your $2,000 efficiency target, ABM focus, and technical audience across three countries, we need channels that excel at precision targeting and sustained engagement.

For reaching VPs of Data Engineering and CDOs in financial services, are you currently seeing success with any particular channels, or is this a fresh approach to market?
