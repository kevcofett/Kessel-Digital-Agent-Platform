# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience with Different KPIs Per Segment

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build this multi-segment media plan with you. This is sophisticated - three distinct objectives with different measurement frameworks. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks.

Your segmentation is smart: conquest for future consideration, in-market for immediate leads, and loyalty for retention actions. Each needs different success metrics.

Let me start with Segment 2 (In-Market Lead Gen) since it has the clearest business outcome. For your 45% allocation ($2.025M), what's your target for qualified leads or test drive appointments?

Turn 2:
Let me update our projections. At $2.025M for 3,500 leads, that's $579 per lead - significantly above your $250 target and even your current $350. You're targeting roughly 65% efficiency improvement.

For auto retail, $250 per qualified lead is aggressive but achievable with tight targeting. High-performing dealership campaigns typically run $300-450 per lead. To hit $250, we'd need precise in-market audience definition and channel optimization.

Your lead-to-test drive math works: 3,500 leads × 35% = 1,225 test drives, hitting your 1,200 target.

What's the average gross profit per vehicle sale, and what percentage of test drives typically convert to sales?

Turn 4:
That's a solid awareness framework. 15-20% brand lift with 5-7% consideration increase requires significant reach against your conquest audience. With $1.575M, you're looking at substantial TV/CTV investment for frequency against competitive owners.

Auto conquest typically needs 60-70% reach with 4-6 frequency to move consideration metrics. Your targeting precision will be critical - competitive owners 35-54 approaching replacement cycles.

Now for Segment 3 (Loyalty) with your $900K allocation. For existing customers approaching service or trade-in cycles, what's your target for retention actions - service appointments booked, trade-in inquiries, or lease renewals initiated?

Turn 5:
Perfect. Let me model Segment 3: $900K for 5,400 total actions (4,800 service + 600 trade/lease) = $167 per action. That's efficient for automotive retention where typical runs $200-300.

Your 35% conversion rate means ~1,890 actual transactions from retention efforts. With your DMS data for lifecycle targeting, this segment should be your most efficient.

Now I can see the full picture:
- Conquest: $1.575M for brand lift/consideration 
- Lead Gen: $2.025M targeting $250 CPL (needs 57% efficiency gain)
- Loyalty: $900K at $167 per action (realistic)

Your biggest challenge is the Lead Gen efficiency gap. Before we dive into audience and channels, what geographic markets are you covering across your 12 dealerships?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 3:
Let me model this out. 275 sales × $2,500 = $687,500 gross profit from your $2.025M investment. That's a 34% gross margin - tight for auto retail where acquisition typically needs 40-50% margins to cover overhead.

At your target $250 per lead: $250 × 3,500 = $875,000 spend, generating $687,500 profit = 78% gross margin. Much healthier.

The challenge: you need 57% cost reduction ($579 to $250) while maintaining lead quality. For auto, that typically requires shifting from broad awareness channels to precise intent-based targeting.

Before we solve the efficiency gap, what about Segment 1 (Conquest)? With $1.575M for awareness, how are you measuring success - brand lift percentage, reach targets, or consideration shift metrics?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 6:
Excellent geographic strategy - different radius approaches per segment make sense. Broad metro for conquest awareness, tight geo-fencing for in-market efficiency, and precise customer coordinates for loyalty.

Two major metros plus suburban corridors gives you substantial scale for conquest reach while allowing tight targeting for performance segments.

Now for the critical piece: your $4.5M budget needs to deliver very different efficiency targets. Lead Gen requires 57% cost reduction to hit $250 CPL, while Conquest needs broad reach for brand lift, and Loyalty looks achievable at $167 per action.

Given these three distinct objectives and efficiency requirements, what's your risk tolerance if one segment underperforms - can you reallocate between segments, or are these allocations fixed?

Turn 8:
Perfect targeting precision - mid-market SUV/crossover buyers with clear intent signals. That audience profile should deliver the efficiency you need for $250 CPL.

Your behavioral triggers (multiple VDPs, price comparisons, financing calculators) indicate high purchase intent. Targeting 3-5 year vehicle owners in upgrade cycle is smart timing. The $75-150K income range aligns with your vehicle price points.

This audience definition is much tighter than typical auto prospecting - which explains why $250 CPL is achievable despite being aggressive.

For Segment 1 (Conquest), you mentioned competitive brand owners 35-54. Are you targeting specific competitor models, or broader "drives Honda/Toyota/Hyundai" audiences? And do you want conquest across all your 3 brands, or prioritizing specific dealership brands for awareness lift?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 7:
Got it - 10% quarterly reallocation flexibility with Lead Gen as priority. That's $450K you can shift if needed.

Your biggest risk is the Lead Gen efficiency gap. At current $579 CPL vs target $250, you'd need to cut costs 57% or increase budget 132% to hit 3,500 leads. With limited reallocation room, this demands precise channel optimization and audience targeting.

Now let's define your audiences. Starting with Segment 2 (Lead Gen) - beyond "active shoppers," what specific behavioral and demographic signals identify your highest-intent prospects? Are you targeting specific vehicle categories, price ranges, or shopping behaviors?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 9:
Excellent - Toyota/Honda/Hyundai conquest with balanced brand lift strategy. Targeting their 3-5 year ownership cycle aligns perfectly with your replacement timing. The halo effect approach across your portfolio is smart for long-term consideration.

Your demographic consistency (35-54, $75-150K) between conquest and lead gen creates audience overlap opportunities - conquest today could become lead gen prospects in 18-24 months.

For Segment 3 (Loyalty), you mentioned DMS lifecycle targeting. Are you segmenting by service due dates, lease expiration windows, or mileage thresholds? And do you treat service retention differently from vehicle trade-in/renewal messaging?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Perfect segmentation strategy. Service messaging at maintenance intervals (30K/60K/90K) with cost-prevention framing, while trade-in targets 4-5 year owners with equity/upgrade messaging. Your DMS precision should drive strong conversion rates.

The 12-18 month lease renewal window is optimal timing - early enough to influence decision-making before competitors engage.

Now for budget allocation. You've set:
- Conquest: $1.575M (35%) for brand lift
- Lead Gen: $2.025M (45%) for 3,500 leads at $250 CPL (aggressive)  
- Loyalty: $900K (20%) for 5,400 actions at $167 each

Given your geographic spread across two major metros, should we weight budget by market size, or do all 12 dealerships get proportional allocation regardless of market potential?

Turn 11:
Smart weighting - 65-70% to northern metro maximizes ROI where demographics and competitive density align best.

Let me model the allocation:
- Northern metro: ~$3M (67% of $4.5M)
- Secondary markets: ~$1.5M (33%)

This concentrates conquest and lead gen investment where competitive owners and higher incomes create better conversion potential.

Now for value proposition. Each segment needs different messaging:
- Conquest: Why switch from Toyota/Honda/Hyundai to your brands
- Lead Gen: Why choose your dealerships over competitors  
- Loyalty: Why stay with your service/trade with you

What's your core competitive advantage that resonates across all three - pricing, service experience, inventory, or something else?

Turn 12:
Excellent positioning - "Modern customer-centric experience with human touch" differentiates across all segments. Your tech-enabled BDC bridges digital efficiency with personal service.

For value prop refinement:
- Conquest: "Experience what modern car buying should be" 
- Lead Gen: "Skip the dealer games - transparent, tech-enabled process"
- Loyalty: "Your trusted partner with cutting-edge convenience"

Now for channels. Given your three distinct objectives and efficiency requirements:

Segment 2 (Lead Gen) needs the most precision to hit $250 CPL. With your intent-based audience (VDP viewers, calculator users), which channels are currently delivering your best qualified leads - paid search, social retargeting, or automotive inventory platforms?

Turn 13:
Perfect. Search + auto sites + social retargeting creates a strong intent funnel. Your pixel strategy for VDP visitors is exactly what will drive efficiency gains.

To hit $250 CPL, recommend shifting allocation toward highest-intent signals:
- Increase search share for immediate intent
- Expand social retargeting for warm audiences  
- Use Cars.com/Autotrader for mid-funnel capture
- Layer behavioral triggers (calculator users, multiple VDPs)

For Segment 1 (Conquest), you need broad reach for brand lift. Given your Toyota/Honda/Hyundai conquest strategy and northern metro focus, are you thinking traditional TV, CTV, or digital video mix for awareness delivery?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 15:
Excellent omnichannel approach - DMS-triggered email/direct mail as primary with paid social/display reinforcement. That precision timing should easily deliver your $167 per action target.

Now for measurement. Your three segments need completely different frameworks:

- Conquest: Brand lift surveys, awareness tracking, consideration metrics
- Lead Gen: Direct response attribution, lead quality scoring, cost efficiency
- Loyalty: Customer lifetime value, retention rates, service/trade conversion

How are you planning to handle cross-segment attribution when the same customer might see conquest messaging today but convert through lead gen channels in 12 months?

Turn 16:
Excellent unified tracking approach. Multi-touch attribution with persistent IDs across DMS-CRM-marketing platforms will capture the full customer journey from conquest exposure to lead gen conversion to loyalty retention.

For testing, given your aggressive $250 CPL target for lead gen, what's your approach to rapid optimization? Are you planning weekly budget shifts between channels, creative testing cycles, or audience refinement based on early performance signals?

Turn 17:
Perfect rapid-cycle approach. 72-hour optimization windows with quality signals (VDP views, form completion rates) beyond just CPL will be critical for hitting $250 targets.

Final step - risks. Your biggest risk is the Lead Gen efficiency gap requiring 57% cost reduction. If you can't achieve $250 CPL, you have limited reallocation flexibility (10% quarterly).

Secondary risks: conquest brand lift measurement lag, loyalty segment dependency on DMS data quality, and potential audience overlap between segments causing frequency issues.

What's your contingency if Lead Gen efficiency doesn't improve by Q2 - increase budget, reduce volume targets, or shift strategy entirely?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 14:
Smart CTV-heavy mix with traditional TV support. CTV's competitive owner targeting will be crucial for efficient brand lift, while traditional TV provides broad metro reach during peak auto seasons.

70% CTV/digital video + 30% traditional TV should deliver the 60-70% reach with 4-6 frequency needed for your 15-20% brand lift targets.

For Segment 3 (Loyalty), you have rich DMS data for precise targeting. Are you planning email/direct mail for service reminders, or expanding into paid channels like social and display for broader customer touchpoints?

Turn 18:
Perfect contingency strategy. Quality over volume with precision targeting as primary lever, then volume reduction to 2,500 leads, with budget increase as last resort.

Your plan is well-structured:
- **Conquest**: $1.575M for brand lift via CTV/TV mix targeting competitive owners
- **Lead Gen**: $2.025M targeting $250 CPL through search + auto sites + social retargeting  
- **Loyalty**: $900K at $167 per action using DMS-triggered multi-channel approach
- **Geography**: 67% northern metro weighting for optimal ROI
- **Measurement**: Unified tracking with multi-touch attribution across segments
- **Testing**: 72-hour optimization cycles for lead gen efficiency

Key success factor: achieving 57% lead gen efficiency improvement through precise intent targeting. Your rapid testing framework and quality-first contingency planning position you well for execution.
