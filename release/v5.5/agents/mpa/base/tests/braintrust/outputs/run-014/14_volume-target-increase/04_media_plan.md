# Media Plan Output: Volume Target Increase

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start - you've given me great foundational data. Let me quickly model what you've shared:

$400K budget ÷ 5,000 customers = $80 per customer acquisition cost. With $320 LTV, that's a 4:1 ratio - solid for home goods where 3-5:1 is typical.

To clarify your primary objective: Are you focused on acquiring exactly 5,000 new customers, or is there a specific revenue target driving that customer count?

Turn 3:
Perfect! Let me validate the economics:

At 42% margin and $80 acquisition cost, you need customers to spend at least $190 on first purchase to break even ($190 × 42% = $80). With $320 LTV, that suggests either higher first purchases or strong repeat behavior - both good signs.

Your economics look solid. $80 acquisition cost with 42% margins gives you flexibility, and the 4:1 LTV ratio provides strong unit economics foundation.

Now let's move to Step 3 - defining your target audience. Home goods is broad, so precision matters for hitting that $80 efficiency target.

Who is your ideal customer? Are you targeting homeowners, renters, specific age ranges, or particular home décor styles?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Excellent - 5,000 new customers is your primary objective with customer acquisition as your key performance metric. That's clear and measurable.

Your $80 cost per customer target sits right in the sweet spot for home goods (typically $60-100), so this looks achievable.

Before we move to audience strategy, I need to understand your unit economics better. With $320 LTV, what's your typical profit margin on first purchases? This helps me assess whether your $80 acquisition cost leaves healthy room for profitability.

Turn 4:
Excellent profile - homeowners 30-55 with quality focus and time constraints is a strong, targetable segment. That demographic typically has both purchasing power and clear intent for home improvements.

Let me dig deeper on one key aspect: When you say "modern, functional" - are we talking minimalist/contemporary style, or more transitional pieces that blend modern and traditional? 

The style preference will significantly impact which platforms and creative approaches work best for reaching this audience.

Turn 5:
Perfect - transitional style with mid-century modern influences gives us a clear aesthetic direction. That style resonates well with your 30-55 professional demographic who value both form and function.

Your audience definition is shaping up nicely: homeowners 30-55, middle to upper-middle class, seeking transitional/mid-century modern pieces that are both sophisticated and practical.

Now for geography - are you targeting nationally, or focusing on specific regions? Home décor preferences and purchasing power can vary significantly by market, and geography will impact your media strategy and efficiency.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Got it - nationwide with strong early traction in Northeast, West Coast, Texas, and Florida metros. That's a solid foundation for national expansion.

For a $400K budget targeting 5,000 customers nationally, we need to be strategic about market prioritization. Some DMAs will be more efficient than others for your transitional home décor positioning.

Should we focus your spend on the markets where you're already seeing strong interest, or do you want to test into new geographic markets as part of this campaign? This impacts both efficiency and growth strategy.

Turn 7:
Smart approach - focus on proven markets while testing strategic expansion. Let me model this allocation:

Primary markets (Northeast, West Coast, TX, FL metros): ~80% of spend = $320K
Secondary test markets (Chicago, Atlanta): ~20% of spend = $80K

This gives you $320K to drive volume in proven geographies while dedicating meaningful budget to test expansion markets.

For the primary markets, which specific metros have shown your strongest performance? For example, are we talking NYC, Boston for Northeast? LA, SF, Seattle for West Coast? This helps me size the opportunity and allocate efficiently.

Turn 8:
Perfect - those 10 metros represent high-income, design-forward markets that align beautifully with your transitional aesthetic and professional target audience.

Let me structure your geography allocation:

**Primary Markets (80% = $320K):**
- Northeast: NYC, Boston, Philadelphia  
- West Coast: SF, LA, Seattle
- Texas: Dallas, Austin
- Florida: Miami, Orlando

**Test Markets (20% = $80K):**
- Chicago, Atlanta

This gives you concentrated firepower in proven DMAs while meaningful test budgets for expansion.

Now for Step 5 - budget allocation. Within your $320K for primary markets, do you want to weight spend equally across all 10 metros, or prioritize based on past performance? For instance, should NYC and LA get larger allocations than smaller metros like Austin?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 9:
Excellent allocation strategy - prioritizing proven large markets while maintaining presence in emerging ones. Let me map this out:

**Primary Market Allocation ($320K):**
- NYC: 18% = $57.6K
- LA: 17% = $54.4K  
- Boston: 12% = $38.4K
- SF: 11% = $35.2K
- Dallas: 10% = $32K
- Seattle: 9% = $28.8K
- Philadelphia: 8% = $25.6K
- Miami: 7% = $22.4K
- Austin: 4% = $12.8K
- Orlando: 4% = $12.8K

**Test Markets ($80K):**
- Chicago: $40K
- Atlanta: $40K

This puts 35% of your primary budget in your two strongest metros while maintaining meaningful presence across all markets.

Now for Step 6 - your value proposition. What's your core message to this audience? How do you position HomeStyle Direct differently from competitors like West Elm or CB2?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
That's a compelling value proposition - "curated simplicity" that solves the time-poor professional's design dilemma. The "design made easy" positioning differentiates you beautifully from competitors who sell individual pieces without the curation angle.

Your messaging foundation is strong: curated collections + seamless coordination + sophisticated results without the design hassle. This resonates perfectly with your 30-55 professional audience who value both aesthetics and efficiency.

Now we're ready for Step 7 - channels. With your $400K budget, target audience, and "curated simplicity" positioning, we need channels that can showcase your aesthetic while reaching design-conscious professionals efficiently.

What channels are you currently using, and which ones have performed best for customer acquisition so far?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Excellent data - Pinterest outperforming Meta makes perfect sense for home décor. Pinterest users are actively seeking design inspiration, making them ideal for your curated collections positioning.

Let me analyze your current performance and suggest optimization:

**Pinterest** (your efficiency leader) should get increased allocation - home décor performs exceptionally well there with users in discovery/planning mode.

**Meta** offers scale but needs refinement - likely better for retargeting and lookalikes than cold acquisition.

**Google Shopping** higher costs suggest you may be competing on generic terms rather than style-specific keywords.

For $400K targeting 5,000 customers, I'd recommend testing **Google Search** for branded/style-specific terms and potentially **Connected TV** for awareness in your primary metros.

What's your current budget split across Pinterest, Meta, and Google Shopping? This helps me model the optimal reallocation.

Turn 12:
You're absolutely right - your budget allocation is backwards from your performance data. Let me recommend a rebalanced mix that follows efficiency:

**Recommended Channel Mix:**
- **Pinterest: 45% = $180K** (up from $140K) - your efficiency leader deserves the largest share
- **Meta: 25% = $100K** (down from $200K) - focus on retargeting and lookalikes, not cold acquisition
- **Google Search: 20% = $80K** (new) - target "mid-century modern furniture," "transitional home decor" vs generic shopping
- **Google Shopping: 10% = $40K** (down from $60K) - maintain presence but reduce inefficient spend

This reallocation puts $40K more into your best performer (Pinterest), reduces Meta by $100K, and adds targeted search to capture intent-driven traffic with style-specific keywords.

At these allocations, Pinterest should drive ~2,250 customers, Meta ~1,250, Google Search ~1,000, and Shopping ~500 to hit your 5,000 target.

Does this channel strategy align with your performance observations?

Turn 13:
Absolutely - smart to test Google Search conservatively given it's unproven for your business. Let me adjust to a more cautious approach:

**Revised Channel Mix:**
- **Pinterest: 50% = $200K** (your proven winner gets even more)
- **Meta: 30% = $120K** (retargeting focus)
- **Google Search: 10% = $40K** (conservative test allocation)
- **Google Shopping: 10% = $40K** (maintain baseline)

This gives Google Search a meaningful but manageable test budget. If it performs well at $40K, we can reallocate from Meta's $120K mid-campaign.

At these levels: Pinterest targets ~2,500 customers, Meta ~1,500, Google Search ~500 test, Shopping ~500.

We should plan monthly performance reviews to potentially shift budget from Meta to Google Search if the test shows strong efficiency. Does this more conservative approach feel right for testing?

Turn 14:
Perfect - you've got a solid, performance-driven channel strategy with built-in flexibility.

Now for Step 8 - measurement. With your multi-channel approach and monthly optimization reviews, we need tracking that shows true channel performance, not just last-click attribution.

For your 5,000 customer target, what's your current measurement setup? Do you have Google Analytics 4, first-party tracking, or any incrementality testing capability? Pinterest often gets under-credited in last-click models, so proper measurement will be crucial for those monthly reviews.
