# Media Plan Output: Efficiency Shock

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business outcome. You mentioned needing 15,000 new policy applications - is your primary objective to drive policy applications, or are you measuring success by actual policy sales/conversions? The distinction matters for forecasting since application-to-policy conversion rates vary significantly in insurance.

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your primary KPI is policy applications, with 15,000 as your volume target. Let me run the math on your efficiency target:

$750K ÷ 15,000 applications = $50 cost per application

That's quite aggressive for insurance. Industry benchmarks typically show $80-150 per application depending on product complexity. Life insurance often runs higher due to longer consideration cycles.

However, with your $2,800 LTV and 40-50% conversion rate, your customer economics look strong. Even at 40% conversion, you're looking at $1,120 LTV per application ($2,800 × 0.40), giving you a healthy 22:1 LTV to acquisition cost ratio.

To hit $50 per application, you'll need very tight audience targeting and efficient channel selection. Is this $50 target based on historical performance, or is this a stretch goal requiring improved efficiency?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it. Moving from $75-80 to $50 per application is a 33-38% efficiency improvement - definitely ambitious but achievable with the right strategy. 

Your strong unit economics give you room to test and optimize. At your historical $75 rate, you'd get 10,000 applications with the same budget, so the stretch to 15,000 requires both better efficiency AND scale.

This level of improvement typically comes from tighter audience definition, better first-party data utilization, or finding lower-cost channels that still deliver quality applicants. The good news is insurance audiences often have strong behavioral signals we can leverage.

Step 1 complete - you're targeting 15,000 policy applications as your primary success metric. Now let's move to audience definition. 

Who is your ideal policyholder? Are you targeting specific life stages, income levels, or demographic profiles that convert best for your life and annuity products?

Turn 4:
Excellent profile. That 35-60 age range with families represents a strong insurance mindset - peak earning years with protection motivations. The risk-aware, financially planning segment typically converts well.

Let me dig deeper on a few key targeting signals. For life insurance, timing often matters as much as demographics. Are there specific life events or triggers that drive your best applicants? Things like:

- New parents vs. parents with older children
- Recent home purchases or refinances  
- Job changes or promotions
- Specific income thresholds that predict conversion

Understanding these behavioral triggers will help us build much tighter audiences than just age and income alone, which is crucial for hitting your $50 efficiency target.

Turn 5:
Perfect - those life event triggers are gold for insurance targeting. New homeowners, new parents, and recent promotions create genuine urgency that drives higher-intent audiences.

Let me estimate your addressable market. Adults 35-60 with families is roughly 25-30% of the US adult population. Layer in middle-to-upper income (household income $75K+) and you're looking at approximately 15-20 million people nationally.

But focusing on your high-intent triggers - new homeowners, new parents, recent promotions - probably narrows that to 2-3 million annually. That's actually ideal sizing for your 15,000 target, giving you room to scale without quick audience exhaustion.

The challenge will be identifying these life events digitally. Platforms have varying abilities to target recent home purchases or new parents.

What's your geographic focus? Are you licensed nationally, or do you concentrate on specific states or regions? Geography will significantly impact both audience size and targeting costs.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Great - national licensing gives you maximum flexibility. Your metro focus makes strategic sense for insurance, as urban and suburban areas typically have higher concentrations of your target income levels and life stages.

Let me structure your geographic approach. I'll build a DMA-level plan focusing on major metros with strong concentrations of middle-to-upper income families aged 35-60. This will include your mentioned markets plus other high-opportunity DMAs.

Here's your initial geography framework:

| DMA | Total Population | Target Audience Size | Target Audience % |
|-----|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Los Angeles | 13.2M | 2.1M | 16% |
| New York | 7.4M | 1.3M | 18% |
| Chicago | 3.5M | 580K | 17% |
| San Francisco | 2.5M | 425K | 17% |
| Boston | 2.4M | 410K | 17% |
| Atlanta | 2.6M | 390K | 15% |
| Seattle | 2.0M | 340K | 17% |
| Denver | 1.7M | 270K | 16% |
| Austin | 1.3M | 195K | 15% |
| **TOTAL** | **34.6M** | **6.0M** | **17%** |

This gives you 6 million target audience across your strongest metros. Should we add more DMAs to expand reach, or does this concentration feel right for testing your efficiency targets?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Perfect. Concentrating on these 9 metros should help drive efficiency in several ways - higher audience density reduces waste, metro markets often have better platform targeting data, and you can optimize creative messaging for regional preferences.

Step 4 complete - we have your geographic framework focused on high-opportunity metros with 6M total target audience.

Now let's structure your budget allocation. With $750K total budget, we need to determine how much goes to media spend versus other costs, and how to distribute across your metro markets.

Typically, 80-85% goes to pure media spend, with 15-20% reserved for creative production, testing, and contingencies. That would put your working media budget around $600-640K.

What's your current split between media spend and other marketing costs? And do you have existing creative assets, or will you need significant creative development budget?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Excellent. That reserve budget will be crucial for doubling down on outperforming markets or pivoting if any major metros underdeliver.

Step 6 complete - we have your budget framework with $650K working media and smart geographic allocation.

Now let's develop your value proposition for the creative messaging. Given your targeting of life event triggers - new homeowners, new parents, recent promotions - your messaging needs to connect financial protection to these specific moments.

What's your current core value proposition? Are you positioning as comprehensive protection, competitive rates, simplified process, or something else? 

And how do you typically differentiate from competitors like State Farm, Allstate, or the direct-to-consumer insurance brands that are heavily advertising right now?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
Got it. At 80% allocation with $50-75K for creative, that gives us:

$750K total budget
- $650K working media budget (87%)
- $75K creative development (10%)
- $25K testing/contingency (3%)

That's actually a strong split that maximizes your media firepower while ensuring quality creative.

For your $650K working media budget across 9 metros, I'd recommend weighting by audience opportunity rather than equal distribution. Based on target audience size and typical insurance performance, here's a suggested allocation:

**Top Tier (40% of budget - $260K):**
- Los Angeles: $130K
- New York: $130K

**Mid Tier (35% of budget - $227K):**
- Chicago: $65K
- San Francisco: $55K
- Boston: $52K
- Atlanta: $55K

**Test Tier (25% of budget - $163K):**
- Seattle: $45K
- Denver: $40K
- Austin: $35K
- Reserve: $43K

This concentrates investment where audience density is highest while leaving room to scale winners. Does this geographic budget distribution align with your market priorities?
