# Media Plan Output: Timeline Compression

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with some quick math on what you've shared. $1.2M ÷ 25,000 customers = $48 CAC target. With $180 LTV, that's a strong 3.75x LTV:CAC ratio - well above the 3x threshold for healthy unit economics.

Your $48 CAC is aggressive for fashion retail where we typically see $60-80, but achievable with tight execution. This puts you 20-40% below market benchmarks, so we'll need precise targeting.

What's the primary business outcome you're trying to achieve with these 25,000 new customers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect - sustainable growth through repeat customers is a smart long-term objective. Now I need to define how we'll measure success with a specific number.

You mentioned wanting loyal, repeat customers rather than one-time purchases. For measuring this campaign's success, what's your primary KPI? 

Are you tracking:
- Total new customers acquired (the 25,000)
- Revenue from new customers in year one
- Customer retention rate at 6 or 12 months
- Something else?

I want to make sure we're optimizing toward the metric that best reflects building that loyal customer base you're after.

Turn 3:
Excellent - 12-month retention rate is the right KPI for building sustainable growth. A 40-50% retention target is ambitious but achievable for fashion retail.

Let me model what this means: If 45% of your 25,000 acquired customers are still active at 12 months, that's 11,250 retained customers. With your $180 LTV, those retained customers represent $2M+ in long-term value from this campaign.

Your $48 CAC becomes even more attractive when we factor in that retention focus - you're essentially paying $48 to acquire customers worth $180 each, with nearly half staying engaged long-term.

Now for economics validation: At $48 CAC with $180 LTV, what's your typical contribution margin on first purchase? I need to ensure this efficiency target is realistic given your product economics.

Turn 4:
Perfect - with 55-60% margins, you're generating $99-108 gross profit on first purchase against a $48 acquisition cost. That's a healthy 2-2.25x return on first transaction, leaving plenty of room for retention-focused strategies.

Your economics are solid. The $48 CAC target is achievable but will require precise execution - you're targeting 20-40% below typical fashion retail benchmarks of $60-80.

Step 1 complete: 25,000 new customers with 45% retention at 12 months.
Step 2 complete: $48 CAC is aggressive but feasible with your strong margins.

Now let's define your audience. You mentioned "fashion-forward urban women" - can you be more specific about your ideal customer? What age range, income level, and lifestyle characteristics define your core audience?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Excellent audience definition. Women 25-45, $75-125K income, metro/tier 2 cities, digitally savvy with Instagram/TikTok usage - that's a well-defined target with clear behavioral signals.

Let me size this audience. In major metro and tier 2 cities, women 25-45 with $75K+ income represents roughly 8-12 million people nationally. Your 25,000 target is about 0.25-0.3% of this audience - a realistic penetration rate for a 12-month campaign.

The professional lifestyle focus (work-to-social versatility) and digital engagement patterns give us strong targeting signals for later channel selection.

Before we move to geography, one clarification: When you say "major metro and tier 2 cities," are you thinking:
- Top 10-15 DMAs only
- Broader metro focus including mid-size cities like Austin, Nashville, Portland
- Any specific geographic priorities or restrictions?

This will help determine if we need 20-30 markets or closer to 50+ for your volume target.

Turn 6:
Perfect - 35-40 markets gives us the geographic reach needed for your 25,000 customer target while maintaining focus on urban professionals.

Let me model this: With 25,000 customers across 35-40 markets, that's roughly 625-715 customers per market on average. This aligns well with your audience density in these metros.

I'll structure this as a DMA-level plan covering major metros (NYC, LA, Chicago) plus strong tier 2 markets (Austin, Nashville, Denver, Seattle, etc.). This approach captures your urban professional audience while providing the volume needed.

Step 3 complete: Women 25-45, $75-125K income, urban professionals across 35-40 DMAs.

Now for Step 4 - Geography selection. Would you like me to recommend the specific 35-40 DMAs based on your audience concentration and urban professional density, or do you have particular markets you definitely want included or excluded?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Based on your core audience - women 25-45, $75-125K income, urban professionals with high digital engagement - here's my recommended 40-market strategy:

**Tier 1 (8 markets):** NYC, LA, Chicago, SF Bay Area, DC, Boston, Seattle, Atlanta

**Tier 2 (12 markets):** Austin, Nashville, Denver, Portland, Miami, Dallas, Houston, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Diego, Minneapolis, Charlotte

**Tier 3 (20 markets):** Raleigh-Durham, Tampa, Orlando, Kansas City, Columbus, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Milwaukee, Sacramento, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, Richmond, Birmingham, Memphis, Louisville, Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Jacksonville, Norfolk

This selection prioritizes markets with:
- High concentration of professional women 25-45
- Above-average household incomes
- Strong digital/social media engagement
- Urban lifestyle orientation

The mix gives you volume (larger metros) plus efficiency (mid-size cities with lower competition). Combined audience across these 40 markets is approximately 9-10 million women in your target demo.

Does this geographic strategy align with your brand vision and market priorities?

Turn 8:
Excellent! Your 40-market strategy is locked in with strong demographic alignment across all tiers.

Step 4 complete: 40 DMAs targeting 9-10 million women in your core demographic.

Now for Step 5 - Budget allocation. With your $1.2M total budget across 40 markets, we need to determine how to distribute this geographically and functionally.

I'm thinking a weighted allocation based on market size and audience density rather than equal distribution. Tier 1 markets would get larger shares given their volume potential, while Tier 2 and 3 provide efficiency opportunities.

How do you want to approach budget allocation? Are you thinking:
- Weighted by market size and audience concentration
- Performance-based with ability to reallocate mid-campaign
- Or do you have specific geographic budget priorities?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Perfect allocation strategy. Let me model this weighted approach:

**Budget Distribution:**
- Tier 1 (8 markets): $660K (55%) = ~$82K per market
- Tier 2 (12 markets): $360K (30%) = ~$30K per market  
- Tier 3 (20 markets): $180K (15%) = ~$9K per market

**Customer Targets by Tier:**
- Tier 1: ~13,750 customers (55% of 25K)
- Tier 2: ~7,500 customers (30% of 25K)
- Tier 3: ~3,750 customers (15% of 25K)

This gives you $48 blended CAC while allowing larger markets to drive volume and smaller markets to prove efficiency. The performance-based reallocation approach is smart - you can shift budget quarterly based on retention and acquisition metrics.

Step 5 complete: Weighted budget allocation with performance flexibility.

Now for Step 6 - Value Proposition. For your urban professional audience seeking work-to-social versatility, what's your core brand message? How do you want Urban Essentials positioned against competitors in this space?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 10:
Brilliant positioning - "Seamless Style, Limitless Potential" perfectly captures that work-to-social versatility your audience craves. The lifestyle approach rather than just product features will resonate strongly with professional women who see fashion as self-expression.

This messaging framework supports your retention goals beautifully. When customers see Urban Essentials as enabling their dynamic lifestyle rather than just selling clothes, they're more likely to become repeat buyers across seasons.

The adaptability theme also differentiates you in a crowded fashion space - most brands focus on trends or occasions, but you're solving the real problem of needing pieces that work everywhere.

Step 6 complete: "Seamless Style, Limitless Potential" positioning focused on versatile sophistication for dynamic professional women.

Now for Step 7 - Channels. Given your audience (digitally savvy, Instagram/TikTok active, 25-45 urban professionals) and your $48 CAC target, what channels are you currently considering or have experience with? This will help me recommend the optimal media mix for your retention-focused goals.
