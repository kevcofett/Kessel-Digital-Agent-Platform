# Media Plan Output: Channel Mix Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with this launch? Is it brand awareness, trial generation, sales volume, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect. Now let's define how you'll measure success. What's your primary KPI - the specific number you'll track to know if this campaign worked? For example, is it aided brand awareness percentage, trial rate, or number of households reached?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using 27.5% trial-to-repeat conversion based on your range - that's solid for organic food launches. You can refine this as your retention data develops.

So at $12.50 per trial customer with 27.5% converting to repeat buyers, your effective cost per repeat customer is about $45. For organic snack brands, that's very strong efficiency.

Your economics look realistic. The $12.50 trial cost is achievable, and converting 66,000 repeat customers from this campaign creates a solid foundation for growth.

Now let's define your target audience. You mentioned health-conscious families - can you describe them more specifically? What demographics, behaviors, or characteristics define your ideal customer?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - 40% aided awareness and 12% trial rate among 2 million households gives us clear targets. Let me model the economics.

At 12% trial rate across 2 million households = 240,000 trial customers. Your $3M budget ÷ 240,000 trials = $12.50 cost per trial customer.

For organic food brands, trial acquisition typically runs $15-25, so $12.50 is efficient - you're targeting about 40% better than market average. This is achievable with strong targeting and compelling sampling offers.

What's the lifetime value of a customer who trials your product, or what percentage of trial customers typically convert to repeat purchasers?

Turn 5:
Perfect audience definition. Health-conscious families with $75K+ income, ages 25-54, who shop at premium grocery stores and prioritize organic products for their kids.

This audience is highly targetable across multiple channels - they're active on social media, read wellness content, and have distinct shopping behaviors. The premium grocery shopping pattern gives us strong first-party data opportunities through retailer partnerships.

One key consideration: this audience likely overlaps significantly across platforms since they're heavy digital users. We'll need coordinated frequency management to avoid oversaturation.

Since you're targeting nationally, are there specific regions or markets that are higher priority? Do you have stronger distribution in certain areas, or are health-conscious families more concentrated in particular markets?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Smart approach - prioritizing markets where you have both strong distribution and high audience concentration. Let me structure this geographically:

**PRIORITY MARKETS (Higher Investment)**
- West Coast: Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles DMAs
- Northeast: Boston, New York, DC DMAs

**SECONDARY MARKETS (Standard Investment)**
- Remaining national DMAs

This tiered approach lets you drive deeper penetration where distribution is strongest while building national awareness. The priority markets typically show 20-30% higher organic product adoption rates.

For budget allocation, would you prefer to weight heavily toward priority markets (maybe 60-70% of spend) or maintain more balanced national coverage? Your distribution strength suggests concentrating spend where you can convert awareness to actual purchase.

Turn 7:
Perfect. Let me map out your geography allocation with 70% weighted to priority markets:

| Geography Tier | DMAs | Budget Allocation | Target Households | Spend per HH |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Priority Markets** | Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, New York, DC | $2,100,000 (70%) | 1,400,000 | $1.50 |
| **Secondary Markets** | Remaining National DMAs | $900,000 (30%) | 600,000 | $1.50 |
| **TOTAL** | National | **$3,000,000** | **2,000,000** | **$1.50** |

This gives you deeper market penetration in high-opportunity areas while maintaining national presence. The $1.50 spend per household is efficient for awareness + trial objectives.

Now let's confirm your budget breakdown. You have $3M total - how much of that is pure media spend versus production, sampling costs, and other campaign elements?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Smart budget structure. Let me validate this allocation:

**BUDGET BREAKDOWN**
- Media Spend: $2.1M (70%)
- Creative + Sampling: $600K (20%)  
- Contingency/Optimization: $300K (10%)

This is well-balanced. The 20% for creative and sampling is appropriate for a product launch requiring trial, and 10% contingency gives you optimization flexibility.

However, let me check the math: $2.1M media ÷ 240,000 trial targets = $8.75 cost per trial (down from our earlier $12.50 calculation using total budget). This is extremely efficient - about 50% better than typical organic food benchmarks of $15-25.

This suggests either: 1) Your sampling programs will drive significant trial volume, or 2) We have room to be more aggressive with reach targets.

How much trial volume do you expect the $600K sampling investment to generate versus paid media?

Turn 9:
Perfect. That clarifies the economics significantly:

**TRIAL BREAKDOWN**
- Paid Media Trials: 190,000 (240,000 total - 50,000 sampling)
- Sampling Program Trials: 50,000
- **Total Trial Target: 240,000**

**REVISED EFFICIENCY**
$2.1M media ÷ 190,000 paid trials = **$11.05 cost per trial**

This puts you right in the sweet spot for organic food - efficient but realistic. The sampling programs at $12 per trial ($600K ÷ 50,000) will generate high-quality, engaged trials that should convert at higher rates than paid media.

Your sampling strategy is smart - Whole Foods demos and wellness events reach your exact audience at point of consideration.

Now let's develop your value proposition. What's the core message that differentiates PureLife's organic snacks? What specific benefit or story resonates most with health-conscious families?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Excellent value proposition. "Nutrition Without Compromise" perfectly addresses the core tension health-conscious parents face - wanting nutritious options their kids will actually eat.

This messaging framework works across multiple touchpoints:
- **For Parents**: Premium, sustainable ingredients + peace of mind
- **For Kids**: Great taste that drives repeat requests
- **For Families**: Convenient solution for busy lifestyles

The "compromise" angle is powerful because it acknowledges the real struggle parents face, then positions PureLife as the solution.

Now we're ready for channel strategy. Based on your objectives (awareness + trial), audience (affluent, health-conscious families), geography (priority markets + national), and value proposition, I'll recommend an integrated channel mix.

What channels are you already considering, or do you want me to build the optimal mix from scratch based on your targets?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Perfect. Let me build an integrated channel strategy optimized for awareness + trial with your health-conscious family audience.

**RECOMMENDED CHANNEL MIX ($2.1M Media Budget)**

| Channel | Budget | % | Strategic Role | Why This Channel |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Meta (Facebook/Instagram)** | $630K | 30% | Awareness + Targeting | Precise targeting of health-conscious parents, strong creative formats |
| **Google Search** | $420K | 20% | Intent Capture | Captures organic food searches, drives trial offers |
| **YouTube** | $420K | 20% | Awareness + Demo | Recipe content, product demos, family-focused storytelling |
| **Programmatic Display** | $315K | 15% | Retargeting + Reach | Wellness site targeting, recipe/parenting content |
| **Influencer Partnerships** | $210K | 10% | Authenticity + Trial | Health/wellness micro-influencers, authentic product integration |
| **Retail Media (Whole Foods)** | $105K | 5% | Point-of-Purchase | Targets shoppers in your key distribution channel |

This mix prioritizes digital channels where your audience is active while including retail media to capture purchase intent. The 60% video allocation (Meta + YouTube) supports your "Nutrition Without Compromise" storytelling.

Does this channel balance align with your expectations, or would you adjust any allocations?
