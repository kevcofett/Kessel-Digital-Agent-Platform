# Media Plan Output: Audience Removal Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect - you've given me a strong foundation. Your business outcome is clear: generate 15,000 test drives for your new EV launch. Let me quickly check the efficiency: $4M ÷ 15,000 = $267 per test drive. For automotive, that's well within the typical $200-400 range, so your target looks achievable.

What's the primary business KPI that defines success beyond test drives - is it actual vehicle sales, qualified leads, or something else?

Turn 3:
At $65-85K, your $2,133 acquisition cost is excellent - that's 2.5-4% of vehicle value, well below the 5-8% typical for luxury automotive.

Let me remodel with realistic conversion rates. For new EV brands at your price point, 5-7% test drive conversion is more typical:

- At 5%: 750 sales from 15,000 test drives = $5,333 per sale
- At 7%: 1,050 sales = $3,810 per sale

Both are still strong for luxury EV, but this changes your volume expectations significantly.

To hit your original 1,875 sales target, you'd need either:
- 26,000-37,000 test drives at realistic conversion rates, or
- Focus heavily on conversion optimization during the test drive experience

Your $4M budget could support the higher test drive volume, but it requires more aggressive media efficiency.

Should we model the plan around realistic 5-7% conversion, or do you want to budget for the higher test drive volume needed to hit 1,875 sales?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Excellent. So your primary KPI is vehicle sales, targeting 1,500-2,250 conversions from those 15,000 test drives at 10-15% conversion rate.

Let me model the economics: At 12.5% average conversion, that's 1,875 sales from your $4M investment = $2,133 per sale. For EVs in the $40-80K range, that's typically very strong efficiency - most automakers see $3-6K acquisition costs.

However, your 10-15% test drive conversion is quite optimistic. Industry benchmarks show 3-8% for new EV launches, with established models hitting 8-12%. Tesla achieves higher rates due to brand strength and limited inventory pressure.

What's your vehicle's price point, and do you have any data from previous launches or competitor analysis that supports the 10-15% assumption?

Turn 4:
Smart approach. Let's model at 6% conversion - that gives us 900 sales from 15,000 test drives at $4,444 per sale. Still strong efficiency for luxury EV.

This realistic foundation actually strengthens your plan because it focuses effort on what matters: quality test drives from genuinely interested prospects rather than volume at any cost.

Now let's move to your audience strategy. You mentioned three segments: eco-conscious early adopters 25-45, luxury buyers 45-65 switching from German sedans, and tech enthusiasts focused on features.

At $267 per test drive, precision targeting becomes critical. Which of these three segments do you believe has the highest purchase intent, and do you have any first-party data from website visitors, previous campaigns, or customer research to build lookalike audiences?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Perfect. Luxury buyers 45-65 as your primary segment makes strategic sense - they have proven purchase behavior in your price range and are showing strong engagement signals.

Let me help you build precise targeting criteria for this segment. Beyond age 45-65, what additional signals can we layer on to identify luxury buyers likely to switch from German sedans?

For example:
- Household income thresholds
- Current vehicle ownership (BMW, Mercedes, Audi)
- Geographic concentration (affluent zip codes, luxury auto corridors)
- Behavioral signals (luxury brand engagement, sustainability interests)

What income level and geographic patterns are you seeing in your website analytics for this high-intent 45-65 group?

Turn 7:
Smart allocation strategy. Let's model 65% to luxury buyers, 20% to eco-conscious early adopters, and 15% to tech enthusiasts.

That gives us:
- $2.6M for luxury buyers (9,750 test drives at $267 each)
- $800K for eco-conscious (3,000 test drives) 
- $600K for tech enthusiasts (2,250 test drives)

At 6% conversion, luxury buyers would deliver ~585 sales at $4,444 each - your highest-value segment getting the focus it deserves.

Now let's define your geography strategy. You mentioned California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Washington. Given your luxury buyer concentration in SF, Seattle, Austin, and affluent NY areas, should we prioritize DMAs where you're already seeing engagement, or do you want broader coverage across all five states?

What's driving the selection of these five states specifically?

Turn 8:
Excellent geographic focus. Let me structure your DMA targeting based on luxury buyer concentration and EV adoption patterns.

**GEOGRAPHY ALLOCATION TABLE - PHASE 1**

| DMA | State | Total Population | Target Audience Size | Target Audience % |
|-----|-------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose | CA | 2,700,000 | 270,000 | 10.0% |
| Los Angeles | CA | 5,200,000 | 416,000 | 8.0% |
| Seattle-Tacoma | WA | 1,900,000 | 152,000 | 8.0% |
| New York | NY | 7,400,000 | 444,000 | 6.0% |
| Austin | TX | 1,300,000 | 91,000 | 7.0% |
| Miami-Fort Lauderdale | FL | 1,700,000 | 102,000 | 6.0% |
| **TOTAL** |  | **20,200,000** | **1,475,000** | **7.3%** |

This gives you 1.47M target households at $250K+ HHI across your priority metros. SF Bay Area shows highest concentration at 10%, reflecting both wealth and EV adoption leadership.

Should we add any secondary DMAs like Dallas, Tampa, or Denver, or focus the full $4M across these six core markets for maximum impact density?

Turn 9:
Perfect. Concentrated market penetration is the right strategy - you'll achieve meaningful share of voice in each DMA rather than getting lost in the noise across too many markets.

With your geography locked and 1.47M target households identified, we have a strong foundation. Your $4M budget across these six metros gives you $2.71 spend per target household - excellent density for luxury automotive.

Let's move to budget allocation. You've set 65% for luxury buyers, 20% for eco-conscious early adopters, and 15% for tech enthusiasts. 

Should we allocate your $4M budget proportionally across all six DMAs, or do you want to weight spending toward your highest-performing markets like SF Bay Area and Seattle where you're seeing the strongest engagement signals?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent targeting foundation. $250K+ HHI in those metros gives us a precise, high-value audience. Tech-savvy professionals comparing specs directly against German luxury is exactly the intent signal we want.

Let me size this opportunity. In SF, Seattle, Austin, and affluent NY metros, households earning $250K+ with luxury vehicle ownership typically represent 8-12% of the population. Across your five states, that's roughly 400,000-600,000 households - a substantial but focused target.

Since you're seeing strong engagement patterns, this suggests we can build effective lookalike audiences even with limited first-party data.

For your secondary segments - eco-conscious early adopters and tech enthusiasts - should we treat them as expansion opportunities after proving success with luxury switchers, or do you want to allocate budget across all three from launch?

Turn 10:
Smart weighting strategy. Let me model a budget allocation that prioritizes your strongest markets:

**BUDGET ALLOCATION BY DMA**
- San Francisco Bay Area: 25% = $1.0M (highest audience concentration at 10%)
- Seattle: 20% = $800K (strong tech adoption, 8% concentration)
- New York: 20% = $800K (largest absolute audience at 444K households)
- Los Angeles: 15% = $600K (large market, 8% concentration)
- Austin: 12% = $480K (emerging tech hub, 7% concentration)
- Miami: 8% = $320K (smallest allocation, 6% concentration)

This gives you 45% in SF/Seattle as requested, while still maintaining meaningful presence in your other key markets. SF gets the highest allocation despite smaller population due to your 10% audience concentration.

Now let's define your value proposition. With luxury buyers comparing you against German sedans, what are your key differentiators - is it performance specs, tech features, sustainability story, or something else that wins the comparison?

Turn 11:
Excellent positioning - you're not just matching German luxury, you're redefining it with tech superiority. 450-mile range and 2.8 seconds 0-60 are compelling proof points that directly address luxury buyer concerns about EV limitations.

Your "tech ecosystem" angle is smart for the luxury switcher segment - it positions the purchase as upgrading to the future rather than compromising for sustainability.

**VALUE PROPOSITION FRAMEWORK:**
- **Performance superiority:** 2.8s 0-60 beats German performance sedans
- **Range leadership:** 450 miles eliminates EV anxiety 
- **Tech advancement:** OTA updates, autonomous features beyond traditional luxury
- **Ecosystem experience:** Connected luxury without compromise

For messaging hierarchy, should we lead with performance specs to grab attention from German sedan owners, then layer in the tech ecosystem story? Or do you want to lead with the "future of luxury" positioning and use specs as proof points?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 12:
Perfect messaging hierarchy. Lead with performance shock value, then elevate to ecosystem transformation - that's exactly how to convert German sedan loyalists.

Now we're ready for channel strategy. With your $4M budget, luxury buyer focus, and six concentrated DMAs, we need channels that can deliver precision targeting and premium brand positioning.

Given your audience is tech-savvy professionals earning $250K+ who are actively researching and comparing specs, what channels are you currently considering? And do you have any existing relationships with automotive media partners or digital platforms that have worked for luxury brands in your space?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 13:
Excellent channel thinking - you're avoiding the generic automotive playbook and focusing on where your audience actually consumes content.

**CHANNEL STRATEGY FRAMEWORK:**

**Tier 1 Precision (60% = $2.4M):**
- Meta/Instagram: Lookalike targeting of luxury auto intenders, video creative showcasing 2.8s performance
- Google: High-intent search around "luxury EV," "Tesla alternative," German sedan comparisons
- LinkedIn: $250K+ HHI targeting with sponsored content and video

**Tier 2 Premium Context (25% = $1M):**
- Wired, TechCrunch, The Verge: Native content and display for tech ecosystem messaging
- Automotive enthusiast: MotorTrend, Car and Driver for credibility and specs comparison

**Tier 3 Connected TV (15% = $600K):**
- Premium streaming targeting affluent households in your six DMAs

This prioritizes precision targeting over broad reach. Does this allocation feel right, or would you shift more budget toward the premium editorial environments?

Turn 14:
Absolutely. LinkedIn's precision targeting is perfect for your audience - we can layer job titles, company size, and geographic targeting for maximum efficiency.

**LINKEDIN GRANULAR TARGETING:**
- Job titles: VP/Director/C-suite + Senior Engineer/Architect + Product/Tech leads
- Company size: 1,000+ employees (correlates with $250K+ compensation)
- Industries: Technology, Financial Services, Consulting, Healthcare
- Geographic: Your six metro areas only
- Behavioral: Luxury brand engagement, automotive interests

This creates a highly qualified pool of decision-makers with both income qualification and tech sophistication.

Now let's establish measurement. Beyond your primary KPI of vehicle sales, what attribution window makes sense for your consideration cycle? And do you have tracking capabilities to connect test drive requests back to specific media touchpoints?

Turn 16:
Excellent - 5-7% for measurement infrastructure is smart for a $4M launch. That $200-280K investment will pay for itself by optimizing the remaining $3.7M+ spend.

**MEASUREMENT BUDGET ALLOCATION:**
- Attribution platform setup: $100-150K
- Automotive analytics partner: $80-120K  
- Tracking implementation: $20-30K

Your unique code system for test drives is solid - simple but effective for connecting digital to physical.

Now let's plan testing strategy. With three audience segments, six DMAs, and multiple channels, what's your appetite for systematic testing versus broad launch? Should we start with your strongest segment (luxury buyers) in top markets (SF/Seattle) to prove the model, or launch across all segments simultaneously?

Turn 17:
Perfect phased approach - de-risk with your strongest segment in highest-potential markets before scaling.

**PHASE 1 TEST PLAN (60 days):**
- Markets: SF Bay Area + Seattle only
- Budget: $800K (20% of total for learning phase)
- Audience: Luxury buyers 45-65, $250K+ HHI only
- Success metrics: >4% test drive conversion rate, <$350 cost per test drive

**PHASE 2 EXPANSION (if Phase 1 succeeds):**
- Add: NYC, LA, Austin, Miami
- Add: Secondary audiences (eco-conscious, tech enthusiasts)
- Budget: Remaining $3.2M over 4-5 months

Finally, let's identify key risks. What concerns you most - audience saturation in small markets, competitive response from Tesla/German brands, or attribution challenges connecting media to sales?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 15:
Smart approach - 90-120 day cycles demand robust attribution infrastructure. For luxury automotive, multi-touch attribution is critical since buyers typically research across 8-12 touchpoints before converting.

**MEASUREMENT RECOMMENDATIONS:**

**Primary KPIs:**
- Vehicle sales (your ultimate success metric)
- Qualified test drive rate (quality over quantity)
- Cost per sale by channel and audience segment

**Attribution Setup:**
- 120-day attribution window minimum
- First-touch and multi-touch reporting
- UTM parameter strategy for all digital touchpoints
- CRM integration to track test drive → sale progression

**Critical Gap:** You'll need incrementality testing to validate true channel contribution. Platform attribution often inflates results by 20-40% for automotive.

Should we budget for measurement infrastructure investment, or do you have internal resources to build tracking capabilities? Also, what's your plan for connecting offline test drives back to digital touchpoints?
