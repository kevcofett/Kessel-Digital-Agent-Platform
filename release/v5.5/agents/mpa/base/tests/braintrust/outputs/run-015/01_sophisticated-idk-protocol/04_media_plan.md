# Media Plan Output: Sophisticated User - IDK Protocol

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start - acquiring 10,000 users with $500K gives us $50 per user to work with. For remittance fintech, that's aggressive but achievable with tight execution.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve beyond user acquisition? Are you focused on transaction volume, revenue growth, or market expansion into new corridors?

Turn 3:
Perfect. Let me update our economics: $10M transaction volume from 10,000 users = $1,000 average per user annually. At 3 transactions per user, that's ~$333 per transaction.

Assuming typical 2-3% transaction fees for remittance, you're projecting $200K-$300K revenue from these users. With $500K acquisition spend, you're investing 1.7-2.5x first-year revenue to acquire them.

This suggests you're banking on strong LTV beyond year one. What's your typical customer lifetime value, or how long do customers usually stay active with QuickSend?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Excellent. Revenue growth through transaction volume is your objective, and 10,000 new users is the path there. 

Now I need to understand how you'll measure success as a number. What's your primary KPI - total transaction volume in dollars, average transactions per user, or something else?

And what's your target for that KPI? For example, if it's transaction volume, what dollar amount are you aiming for from these 10,000 new users?
