# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience Unified Media Plan

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build this media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've provided excellent segment detail upfront - that will help us build a precise plan. Let me start with your business outcome.

$3M budget targeting 25,000 enrollees = $120 per enrollment. For health insurance, that's quite efficient - typical acquisition costs run $150-300 per enrollee based on industry benchmarks.

What's the primary business outcome you're trying to achieve beyond the 25,000 enrollments? Are you focused on premium revenue growth, market share expansion in specific regions, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect. Market share expansion with premium optimization - that's a strong strategic foundation. Let me update our efficiency analysis.

At $120 per enrollee, you're targeting 50-60% better efficiency than typical health insurance acquisition costs. That's aggressive but achievable with precise targeting and strong value proposition execution.

For your primary success metric, what specific number will you use to measure success? Is it the 25,000 total enrollments, or do you have enrollment targets by segment, or are you tracking something like premium revenue per acquisition dollar?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent. Let me break down what this means by segment:

**Segment Targets & Efficiency:**
- Young Professionals: 10,000 enrollees at $120 = $1.2M budget allocation
- Families: 8,750 enrollees at $120 = $1.05M budget allocation  
- Pre-Medicare: 6,250 enrollees at $120 = $750K budget allocation

Your $120 target is ambitious across all segments. Young professionals typically convert most efficiently ($80-150), while pre-Medicare can run $200-400 due to higher consideration periods and competition.

To hit these targets, we'll need segment-specific strategies. The pre-Medicare segment at $120 per enrollee is particularly aggressive - that's about 40-50% below typical benchmarks.

Does this allocation feel right strategically, or should we adjust the mix based on realistic acquisition costs by segment?

Turn 4:
Perfect - your team's confidence in precision targeting will be crucial for hitting these efficiency targets. Let's move to audience definition where we can build that precision.

You've given me strong demographic foundations for each segment. Now I need to understand the behavioral and psychographic signals that will help us find your highest-converting prospects within each group.

Starting with Young Professionals - beyond gym membership and digital preference, what specific behaviors or interests indicate someone is actively considering health insurance? Are they researching benefits during job transitions, comparing plans online, or showing other insurance shopping signals?

Turn 6:
Great signals for Families. Let me capture those:

**High-Intent Signals:**
- New home purchases in suburban markets
- Family size changes (new child, kids aging up)
- School district changes/relocations
- Annual open enrollment periods

**Research Channels:**
- Facebook parenting groups
- Nextdoor neighborhood networks
- School communication channels
- Cost comparison tools/spreadsheet analysis

Now for Pre-Medicare - what behaviors signal someone in the 55-64 age range is actively considering health insurance changes? Are they researching retirement transitions, employer plan changes, or Medicare preparation resources?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Excellent behavioral signals. Let me capture those conversion indicators for Young Professionals:

**High-Intent Signals:**
- Job transition/new employer activity (LinkedIn signals)
- Age 26 transition off parental plans
- Research on eHealthInsurance, broker comparison sites
- Reddit health insurance forum engagement
- Professional networking event attendance

**Channel Preferences:**
- Mobile-first digital experience
- Tech product-style interface expectations

Now for Families - what behavioral signals indicate suburban parents are actively shopping for health insurance? Are they triggered by family size changes, employer plan changes, or specific life events like moving to new areas?

Turn 7:
Perfect. Let me capture those Pre-Medicare signals:

**High-Intent Signals:**
- Medicare transition research
- Employer plan retirement transition planning
- Doctor network continuity concerns
- Health condition coverage gap analysis

**Research Channels:**
- AARP forums and resources
- Retirement planning sites (Kiplinger, etc.)
- Local senior center workshops
- Medicare supplement comparison tools

Now I have strong behavioral targeting for all three segments. For geography, you mentioned specific preferences by segment. Let me clarify the geographic targeting:

**Young Professionals:** NYC, SF, LA, Chicago metros
**Families:** Suburban markets around top 50 metros  
**Pre-Medicare:** National with heavy focus on FL, AZ, TX

Should we focus the Family segment on suburbs specifically around those same top metros where Young Professionals are concentrated, or cast a wider net across all top 50 metro suburban areas?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Excellent strategic thinking. Broader suburban targeting will likely improve efficiency - secondary metro suburbs often have lower competition and CPMs than tier-1 markets.

**Geographic Strategy Confirmed:**
- Young Professionals: NYC, SF, LA, Chicago metros (concentrated)
- Families: Suburbs across all top 50 metros (broad net)
- Pre-Medicare: National with FL, AZ, TX emphasis (wide reach)

This geographic spread gives us good cost arbitrage opportunities, especially for Families in secondary markets.

Now for budget allocation. We calculated segment budgets based on enrollment targets, but should we weight any segment differently based on geographic cost realities? For instance, Young Professionals in tier-1 metros will face higher CPMs than Pre-Medicare in national targeting.

Turn 9:
Smart approach. Let me model the flexibility structure:

**Base Budget Allocation:**
- Young Professionals: $1.2M (40% of budget)
- Families: $1.05M (35% of budget)  
- Pre-Medicare: $750K (25% of budget)

**With 15% Flexibility Reserve:**
- Core allocation: $2.55M (85%)
- Flexibility fund: $450K (15%)

This allows reallocation of up to $450K between segments based on performance. If Young Professionals in tier-1 metros run $150-180 per enrollee while Pre-Medicare achieves $90-110, you can shift budget toward better-performing segments.

The flexibility reserve also protects against competitive response - if competitors increase spend in any segment, you have funds to maintain share of voice.

Now for value proposition - each segment needs distinct messaging. What's your core value proposition for Young Professionals who want that "tech product" insurance experience?

Turn 10:
Perfect positioning for Young Professionals - that tech platform angle will resonate strongly with their expectations.

**Young Professionals Value Prop Confirmed:**
- Modern, tech-enabled solution
- Subscription-like experience vs. traditional insurance
- Mobile claims + telemedicine integration
- Wellness incentives for health-conscious lifestyle
- Transparency and convenience focus

Now for Families - given their spreadsheet mentality and comprehensive coverage needs, what's your core value proposition for suburban parents who want predictability and cost control?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 12:
Perfect - that trusted transition partner positioning addresses their core anxieties about change and continuity.

**Pre-Medicare Value Prop Confirmed:**
- Seamless healthcare continuity and network preservation
- Clear Medicare preparation guidance and education
- Stable bridge coverage between employer plans and Medicare
- Knowledgeable resource for complex life transition
- Health and financial stability protection

Now we're ready for channels. With your distinct audiences, geographies, and value props defined, I can recommend the optimal media mix for each segment.

Given Young Professionals' digital-first behavior in tier-1 metros, Families' community-driven research in suburban markets, and Pre-Medicare's educational content consumption nationally - what channels do you currently use, and are there any you want to avoid or prioritize?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Excellent - that stability and predictability messaging will resonate with suburban families' need for financial control.

**Family Value Prop Confirmed:**
- Zero surprises, predictable costs
- Comprehensive pediatric and family coverage
- Flexible plans that adapt to changing family needs
- Stable financial safety net positioning
- Focus on family well-being vs. insurance complexity

Now for Pre-Medicare - given their concerns about network continuity and Medicare transition, what's your value proposition for this segment approaching retirement?

Turn 13:
Perfect - precision over broad reach aligns with your aggressive efficiency targets. Let me recommend a segment-specific channel strategy based on those behavioral insights:

**Young Professionals ($1.2M):**
- LinkedIn targeting (job changes, professional signals) - 35%
- Google Search (health insurance + life transition terms) - 30% 
- Reddit advertising (health insurance forums) - 20%
- Programmatic display (gym/wellness sites) - 15%

**Families ($1.05M):**
- Facebook (parenting groups, lookalikes) - 40%
- Google Search (family health insurance terms) - 25%
- Nextdoor advertising - 20%
- YouTube (parenting/family content) - 15%

**Pre-Medicare ($750K):**
- Google Search (Medicare transition terms) - 45%
- AARP digital partnerships - 25%
- Facebook (retirement/senior targeting) - 20%
- Local digital (senior center partnerships) - 10%

This targets intent signals at each research stage. The Pre-Medicare heavy search weighting captures their active research behavior, while LinkedIn for Young Professionals hits job transition moments.

Does this channel mix align with where you see each segment spending their research time?
