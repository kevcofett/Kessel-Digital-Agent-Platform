# Media Plan Output: Volume Target Increase

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by modeling your economics. $400K ÷ 5,000 customers = $80 per customer acquisition cost. With $320 LTV, that's a 4:1 ratio - excellent for sustainable growth. Home goods typically runs $60-100 CAC, so you're targeting mid-range efficiency.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 5,000 new customers? Are you focused on revenue growth, market expansion, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Revenue growth through customer base expansion is clear. Let me confirm your success measurement: you're targeting 5,000 new customers at $80 CAC with $320 LTV for $1.6M in customer value.

I notice you mentioned the 30-55 age range interested in home refreshing. That's a solid starting point for Step 3. But first, let me validate your economics are realistic.

At $80 CAC with $320 LTV, you need a 25% efficiency rate ($80/$320). For home goods e-commerce, this is achievable - many brands hit 20-30% of LTV as acquisition cost. Your 4:1 ratio provides good margin for profitable growth.

Does your $320 LTV represent lifetime value over a specific period, like 12 months or 24 months? This helps me assess if your efficiency target accounts for payback timing.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - 24-month LTV with 3-4 repeat purchases shows strong customer retention. That $320 represents real relationship value, not just first transaction, which makes your $80 CAC target very realistic for sustainable growth.

Your economics are solid: 25% of LTV as acquisition cost with 24-month payback provides healthy cash flow. Home goods brands typically see this efficiency when targeting quality customers who value the category.

Now let's define your target audience precisely. You mentioned 30-55 age range interested in home refreshing. To build effective targeting, I need to understand your ideal customer better.

What specific behaviors or life situations typically drive someone to discover and purchase from HomeStyle Direct?

Turn 4:
Perfect! Transitional life stages are powerful targeting signals - first-time homebuyers, new parents, and recent movers all have high purchase intent and immediate needs.

Your audience profile is clear: design-conscious consumers in transition who research before buying and value style-function balance. This gives us strong behavioral and life-event targeting options.

For targeting precision, I need to understand your geographic focus. Are you targeting nationally, or do you have specific regions, metro areas, or states that perform better for HomeStyle Direct?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Excellent - urban/suburban metros with design-conscious demographics align perfectly with your transitional life stage targeting. Seattle, Austin, Denver, and Northeast corridor are all strong markets for home goods with higher concentrations of your target audience.

Let me structure your geographic targeting with audience sizing. I'll model your top-performing DMAs plus a few additional metros that match your customer profile.

**GEOGRAPHIC TARGETING - DMA LEVEL**

| DMA | Total Population | Target Audience Size | Target Audience % |
|-----|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| New York | 7,450,000 | 820,000 | 11.0% |
| Boston | 2,380,000 | 285,000 | 12.0% |
| Washington DC | 2,470,000 | 295,000 | 11.9% |
| Seattle-Tacoma | 1,870,000 | 243,000 | 13.0% |
| Denver | 1,650,000 | 215,000 | 13.0% |
| Austin | 1,020,000 | 143,000 | 14.0% |
| Portland | 1,240,000 | 161,000 | 13.0% |
| **TOTAL** | **17,080,000** | **2,162,000** | **12.7%** |

This gives you 2.16M target audience across your strongest markets. At 5,000 customer target, you'd need 0.23% conversion from target audience - realistic for well-targeted campaigns.

Does this geographic focus make sense, or should we adjust the market selection?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Perfect! Geographic allocation based on audience size and performance makes complete sense. Let me model your budget distribution with higher allocation to New York and Boston.

**BUDGET ALLOCATION BY GEOGRAPHY**

| DMA | Target Audience | Audience % | Budget Allocation | Per-Customer Target |
|-----|----------------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| New York | 820,000 | 37.9% | $160,000 (40%) | 2,000 customers |
| Boston | 285,000 | 13.2% | $60,000 (15%) | 750 customers |
| Washington DC | 295,000 | 13.6% | $48,000 (12%) | 600 customers |
| Seattle-Tacoma | 243,000 | 11.2% | $44,000 (11%) | 550 customers |
| Denver | 215,000 | 9.9% | $36,000 (9%) | 450 customers |
| Austin | 143,000 | 6.6% | $28,000 (7%) | 350 customers |
| Portland | 161,000 | 7.4% | $24,000 (6%) | 300 customers |
| **TOTAL** | **2,162,000** | **100%** | **$400,000** | **5,000** |

This gives you 55% of budget focused on your two largest markets while maintaining realistic efficiency targets across all DMAs.

Now let's develop your value proposition. Based on your transitional life stage audience, what key message resonates most: the design quality, the functionality, the affordability, or something else entirely?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Excellent! "Authentically you" positioning with accessible design is powerful - it speaks directly to your transitional audience's desire for self-expression during life changes.

**VALUE PROPOSITION FRAMEWORK**

**Core Promise:** Transform your space to reflect who you are  
**Functional Benefit:** Design-forward pieces that work with real life  
**Emotional Benefit:** Home that feels authentically yours  
**Proof Points:** Stylish yet kid/pet-friendly, modern comfort, accessible pricing

This resonates perfectly with first-time homeowners wanting to establish identity, new parents needing functional beauty, and recent movers creating fresh starts.

**MESSAGING BY AUDIENCE SEGMENT**
- First-time buyers: "Make it yours from day one"
- New parents: "Beautiful spaces that work with family life" 
- Recent movers: "Fresh start, fresh style"

Your value prop is strong and differentiated. Now let's build your channel strategy. With $400K budget, transitional life stage targeting, and metro focus, we need channels that reach people actively researching home solutions.

What channels are you currently using, and which have performed best for customer acquisition?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
Excellent insights! Pinterest performing strongest makes perfect sense - it's where your audience actively plans and researches home projects. Meta being "okay" suggests room for optimization, and Google Shopping underperforming likely means search strategy needs refinement.

**CURRENT CHANNEL PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT**
- Pinterest: Strong audience-channel fit for home planning behavior
- Meta: Decent reach but targeting could be tighter  
- Google Shopping: Traffic without conversion suggests intent mismatch

Based on your $400K budget and performance data, I recommend expanding your Pinterest investment while optimizing Meta targeting around life-stage signals. For Google, shifting from Shopping to Search campaigns targeting "living room ideas" and "home decor" queries could capture higher-intent traffic.

**PROPOSED CHANNEL MIX**
- Pinterest: 45% ($180K) - your proven performer
- Meta: 30% ($120K) - optimized for life transitions
- Google Search: 20% ($80K) - high-intent home decor queries  
- Testing budget: 5% ($20K) - TikTok or Connected TV pilots

Does this allocation align with your experience, or should we adjust based on what you've learned about channel performance?
