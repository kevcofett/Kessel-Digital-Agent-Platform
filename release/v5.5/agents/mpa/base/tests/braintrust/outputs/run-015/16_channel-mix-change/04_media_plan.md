# Media Plan Output: Channel Mix Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You mentioned awareness goals - what specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with this launch? Are you looking to drive trial purchases, build brand recognition for future sales, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect, trial purchases is a clear objective. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success. What's the specific number you're tracking - is it total trial purchases, number of first-time buyers, or something else? And what's your volume target?

Turn 4:
Perfect strategy - invest in trial to build a repeat customer base. Your $30 CAC with breakeven on repeat purchases is solid for organic foods where loyal customers typically generate $150-300 LTV.

Now let's define your target audience precisely. You mentioned health-conscious families - can you describe them more specifically? What demographics, behaviors, or characteristics define your ideal trial customer?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it - 100,000 first-time buyers generating $5M in trial sales. Let me check the math: $5M ÷ 100,000 = $50 average order value per trial customer.

With your $3M budget targeting 100,000 customers, that's $30 cost per customer acquisition. For organic food brands, typical CAC runs $25-45, so you're well within realistic range.

At $50 AOV with organic snack margins typically around 40-50%, you'd have roughly $20-25 contribution per customer against $30 acquisition cost. This means you're investing in trial knowing repeat purchases drive profitability - is that the strategy, or do you need to be profitable on first purchase?

Turn 6:
Perfect - that gives us strong behavioral signals. CrossFit/yoga participation, nutrition tracking apps, and following wellness influencers are excellent targeting criteria that go beyond basic demographics.

One more audience question: Are there any groups you specifically want to exclude? For example, existing customers of competing organic snack brands, certain geographic areas, or demographics that tested poorly in research?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Excellent profile. Let me add a few more targeting signals to sharpen this audience. Beyond shopping at Whole Foods and reading wellness content, what other behaviors help identify your ideal customers? 

For example, do they follow specific dietary patterns (plant-based, gluten-free), engage with particular brands or influencers, participate in fitness activities, or have other lifestyle indicators that signal they'd be interested in premium organic snacks?

Turn 8:
Perfect allocation - $1.8M for acquisition targeting 100,000 customers means $18 per customer in media spend, which leaves room for platform fees and creative costs within your $30 total CAC target.

Now let's craft your value proposition. For health-conscious families choosing between organic snack options, what makes your product the clear choice? What's the key message that will drive trial among CrossFit moms and nutrition-tracking dads?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Got it - Northeast and West Coast metros with strong organic adoption. That geographic focus makes sense for maximizing trial efficiency.

Now let's validate your budget allocation. You have $3M total targeting 100,000 customers at $30 CAC. How are you thinking about splitting this budget? For example, what portion goes to customer acquisition versus supporting activities like content creation, influencer partnerships, or retail support?

Turn 10:
Excellent point on Pinterest - your audience research should drive allocation. Let me adjust:

**Revised allocation with higher Pinterest:**
- Meta (Instagram/Facebook): $600K 
- Google Search: $450K
- Pinterest: $270K (increased from $180K)
- Google Display/YouTube: $240K
- Programmatic: $240K

This gives Pinterest 15% of acquisition budget, recognizing its strength for recipe integration and nutrition content discovery.

Now let's establish measurement. Beyond tracking your 100,000 first-time buyers, what metrics will tell you if the campaign is working week-by-week? Are you tracking things like cost per trial, repeat purchase rate, or specific engagement metrics by channel?

Turn 11:
Perfect measurement framework. You'll want to track cost per trial by channel weekly to optimize toward your $30 target, plus conversion rates from impression to trial to spot optimization opportunities.

Now for testing strategy. Given your 3-month timeline and trial objective, what variations do you want to test? I'd recommend testing creative approaches (performance-focused vs. family-focused messaging), audience segments (CrossFit enthusiasts vs. general wellness), and potentially product positioning. What tests would give you the most valuable insights for scaling beyond Q1?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
"Nutrition that moves with you" is strong - directly speaks to the performance mindset of your CrossFit/yoga audience while addressing family needs.

Now let's build your channel strategy. Given your $1.8M acquisition budget, health-conscious family audience, and trial-driving objective, I recommend a mix that captures both intent and builds awareness:

**Primary channels (70% of acquisition budget):**
- Meta (Instagram/Facebook): $630K - Strong for wellness targeting and visual product showcase
- Google Search: $450K - Captures organic snack intent and competitor research
- Pinterest: $180K - High health/wellness engagement, recipe integration potential

**Secondary channels (30%):**
- Google Display/YouTube: $270K - Video demonstrations and broader awareness
- Programmatic: $270K - Retargeting and lookalike expansion

This prioritizes platforms where your audience actively engages with health content. Does this align with where you see your customers discovering new products?

Turn 13:
Spot on - channel saturation and consumer fatigue are real threats in wellness. Your "performance-optimized" angle helps differentiate from generic "healthy snack" positioning, but you'll need sharp execution.

**Risk mitigation recommendations:**
- **Channel saturation**: Start with smaller daily budgets to test efficiency before scaling, monitor CPM inflation weekly
- **Retail availability**: Coordinate digital launch timing with confirmed shelf dates, build retailer locator into campaigns
- **Consumer fatigue**: Lead with specific benefits (high-protein, low-sugar) rather than broad wellness claims, test performance messaging first

We've built a solid foundation: $1.8M acquisition budget across Meta, Search, Pinterest, Display targeting 100,000 trial customers at $30 CAC, with clear measurement and testing protocols. Your plan balances awareness and intent capture while addressing key risks.

Ready to refine any specific areas, or shall we dive deeper into execution details for your priority channels?

Turn 14:
Perfect - Meta and Pinterest are your highest-impact channels given your audience behavior. Let me break down the creative strategy for each:

**Meta (Instagram/Facebook) - $600K budget:**
- **Creative focus**: Short-form video showing product in action - post-workout snacking, meal prep scenes, active family moments
- **Performance messaging**: "21g protein, 3g sugar" vs. generic wellness claims
- **Format mix**: 60% video (Reels/Stories), 30% carousel (ingredient highlights), 10% static (clean product shots)
- **Targeting**: Lookalikes of CrossFit/yoga participants, interests in nutrition tracking apps

**Pinterest - $270K budget:**
- **Creative focus**: Recipe integration pins, nutrition comparison charts, meal planning boards
- **Performance positioning**: "Snacks that fuel your goals" with macro breakdowns
- **Format emphasis**: Rich Pins with nutrition data, recipe collections, before/after workout fuel guides
- **Targeting**: Health recipe pinners, fitness meal prep searchers

Both channels should lead with specific performance benefits rather than broad wellness claims. Does this creative direction align with your brand guidelines and production capabilities?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 12:
Excellent testing plan. A/B testing performance messaging vs. family wellness across your primary channels will give clear direction for Q2 scaling.

Finally, let's identify risks. I see a few potential challenges:

**Primary risks:**
1. **Organic food seasonality** - Q1 typically sees lower organic purchases post-holidays vs. spring health trends
2. **Trial-to-repeat conversion** - If your 30-40% repeat rate assumption is optimistic, LTV economics break down
3. **Channel saturation** - Pinterest and Instagram wellness space is highly competitive; CPMs may inflate quickly
4. **Retail availability** - Digital demand means nothing if target stores are out of stock

Which of these concerns you most, and do you see other risks I missed?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 15:
Excellent - sounds like your creative team is already aligned with performance-focused messaging. With your assets in development and targeting strategy set, you're well-positioned for launch.

Your media plan is solid: $1.8M driving 100,000 trials at $30 CAC, with Meta and Pinterest leading acquisition supported by search and display. Clear measurement framework, smart testing approach, and realistic risk mitigation.

Next steps would be finalizing creative production timelines, setting up tracking infrastructure for cost per trial monitoring, and coordinating digital launch timing with retail availability at Whole Foods and Sprouts.

Is there anything else you'd like to refine in the plan, or are you ready to move into execution phase?
