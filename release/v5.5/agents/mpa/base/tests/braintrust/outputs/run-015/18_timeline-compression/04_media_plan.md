# Media Plan Output: Timeline Compression

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business outcome. You mentioned acquiring 25,000 new customers - is customer acquisition your primary objective, or are you also focused on revenue targets or brand awareness alongside acquisition?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your primary objective is customer acquisition with revenue growth as a secondary goal. For measurement, customer count will be your primary KPI, with revenue as secondary.

Let me check your efficiency target. $1.2M ÷ 25,000 customers = $48 per customer acquisition cost. With your $180 LTV, that's a 3.75x LTV:CAC ratio - very strong for fashion retail where 3x is typically considered excellent.

This efficiency is achievable but requires disciplined execution. Fashion retail CAC typically runs $40-70, so your $48 target is well within range.

Is this $48 CAC realistic based on your current performance, or would this represent an improvement from where you are today?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it. Moving from $65 to $48 CAC is a 26% efficiency improvement - ambitious but achievable with better targeting and optimization. Your confidence in tightening Instagram targeting is well-founded, as fashion brands often see 20-30% efficiency gains from audience refinement.

At $48 CAC, you're targeting the efficient end of fashion retail benchmarks. This will require precise audience definition and likely strong first-party data leverage.

Now let's define your target customer. Who is the ideal customer you want those 25,000 acquisitions to be? Think demographics, behaviors, or current customer insights.

Turn 4:
Excellent profile. Urban professional women 25-45 in major metros is a well-defined, high-value segment. The social media influence and work-to-evening versatility need creates strong targeting signals.

This audience likely ranges 2-4 million addressable across your target metros, giving you good scale without being overly broad. The disposable income and metro concentration should support your $48 CAC target.

One key consideration: within that 25-45 range, do you see different behaviors or value between younger professionals (25-35) versus established professionals (35-45)? This could affect targeting precision and potentially CAC efficiency.

Turn 5:
That's valuable insight. The 35-45 segment aligns well with your $180 LTV and likely drives higher efficiency, while 25-35 offers volume but may require different messaging and potentially higher CAC initially.

Given your $48 CAC target and 25,000 customer goal, you'll likely need both segments. The 35-45 group can anchor your efficiency while 25-35 provides scale.

Now for geography: you mentioned major metros like NYC, Chicago, and San Francisco. Are you planning to focus exclusively on these tier-1 markets, or are you considering tier-2 metros as well? Geographic concentration affects both audience size and competition levels.

Turn 6:
Smart expansion strategy. Tier-2 metros like Austin, Denver, and Nashville offer 20-30% lower media costs than NYC/SF while maintaining strong professional demographics. This geographic mix should support your $48 CAC target.

Your multi-tier approach gives you roughly 8-12 million addressable audience across all markets - excellent scale for 25,000 acquisitions without saturation risk.

Now let's validate your budget allocation. You have $1.2M total. Assuming 80% goes to media buying, that's $960K for acquisition. At your $48 target, this projects to 20,000 customers - 5,000 short of your 25,000 goal.

To hit 25,000 at $48 CAC, you'd need $1.2M purely for acquisition, plus additional budget for creative and operations. Does this math align with your expectations, or do we need to adjust targets?

Turn 7:
Excellent thinking. Leveraging organic social and influencer partnerships can absolutely extend your media efficiency. Fashion brands often see 15-25% CAC improvement when combining paid media with strong organic content and micro-influencer programs.

Here are the realistic paths forward:
1. **Hybrid approach**: $960K paid media (20,000 customers) + influencer/organic programs (5,000 customers)
2. **Efficiency push**: Target $40 CAC through tighter audience precision (would need 30% efficiency gain)
3. **Budget reallocation**: Shift more of the $1.2M from other areas into direct acquisition

For fashion retail, option 1 is most achievable. Micro-influencer partnerships in your tier-2 markets could deliver customers at $25-35 effective cost when combined with your paid strategy.

Which approach feels most realistic given your team's capabilities and existing influencer relationships?

Turn 8:
Perfect. The hybrid approach leverages your existing influencer momentum while maximizing your paid media efficiency. Micro-influencers in tier-2 markets often have stronger engagement rates and lower costs than tier-1 equivalents - ideal for your strategy.

Now let's define your value proposition. For your urban professional women, what's the core message that differentiates Urban Essentials? Think about what makes them choose you over competitors, especially given the work-to-evening versatility you mentioned earlier.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 9:
Excellent positioning. "Effortless versatility" speaks directly to your target's pain point - the professional woman's time constraints and need for adaptable style. This value prop should resonate strongly across both your 25-35 and 35-45 segments.

The "confidence and flexibility" messaging aligns perfectly with your tier-2 market expansion, as these growing professional populations especially value brands that understand their dynamic lifestyles.

Now for channels. Given your Instagram optimization opportunity, existing influencer relationships, and audience behavior, what channels are you currently using, and where do you see the biggest opportunities for that efficiency improvement to hit your $48 CAC target?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 11:
Excellent. Your channel mix gives you strong efficiency levers while maintaining scale for 25,000 customers. The tier-2 geographic focus should deliver those CAC improvements you need.

For measurement, let's establish your key tracking framework. Beyond customer acquisition count, what attribution model works best for your business? Given your multi-touch approach across Instagram, TikTok, Google, and influencers, you'll need clear attribution to optimize that $48 CAC target.

Are you currently using first-click, last-click, or a more sophisticated attribution model? And how are you planning to measure the incremental impact of your influencer partnerships alongside paid media?

Turn 13:
Smart priority. Creative is often the highest-impact testing area - fashion brands frequently see 40-60% performance swings from messaging optimization, far exceeding audience refinement gains.

Your work-to-evening transition concept is perfect for testing. Here's a focused creative testing framework:

**Test 1**: Lifestyle demonstration vs. product-focused. Show real professionals transitioning from boardroom to happy hour vs. traditional product shots.

**Test 2**: Messaging hierarchy. Lead with "versatility" vs. "confidence" vs. "time-saving" to see which value prop drives strongest response.

**Test 3**: Social proof angles. Customer testimonials vs. influencer endorsements vs. "worn by professionals at [company types]."

Run these sequentially with your $60K testing budget - $20K per test over 3-4 weeks each. Winner becomes your primary creative direction.

Finally, let's address risks. What's your biggest concern about hitting that 25,000 customer target? Platform changes, competitive pressure, seasonal fluctuations, or something else?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Smart focus. Instagram optimization is your biggest efficiency lever - fashion brands typically see 20-30% CAC improvement from tighter audience targeting alone.

Here's your strategic channel mix recommendation:

**Instagram (50% - $600K)**: Primary driver with refined targeting using lookalikes from your highest-LTV customers. Layer in geographic targeting for tier-2 markets where competition is lower.

**TikTok (25% - $300K)**: Strong for 25-35 segment acquisition, especially in tier-2 markets. Focus on authentic content showcasing work-to-evening transitions.

**Google Search (20% - $240K)**: Capture high-intent traffic searching "professional women's clothing" and similar terms. Lower volume but typically highest conversion rates.

**Testing allocation (5% - $60K)**: Test emerging channels like Pinterest Shopping or LinkedIn for the 35-45 professional segment.

The integrated approach is key - use organic content to warm audiences, then retarget with paid, while influencers provide social proof across the funnel.

Does this allocation align with where you see the strongest performance potential?

Turn 12:
You're right - last-click severely undervalues upper-funnel channels like TikTok and influencers. For fashion retail with your multi-touch journey, you're likely under-crediting awareness drivers by 30-40%.

**Recommended measurement approach:**

**Attribution**: Move to data-driven attribution in Google Analytics 4 or invest in a solution like Triple Whale or Northbeam. This will properly credit your Instagram and TikTok awareness efforts.

**Influencer measurement**: Beyond tracking links, implement geo-lift tests in your tier-2 markets. Run influencer campaigns in Austin but not Denver, then compare acquisition rates. This captures true incrementality, not just direct attribution.

**Incrementality validation**: Reserve 10-15% of budget for holdout testing. Exclude small geographic areas from campaigns to measure true lift vs organic growth.

The key is balancing speed (tracking links for daily optimization) with accuracy (geo-tests for strategic decisions).

Now for testing strategy. With your 5% testing budget and efficiency targets, what would you most want to test first - new audience segments, creative approaches, or emerging channels?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 14:
Absolutely valid concern. Platform dependency is the biggest risk for social-heavy strategies. Algorithm changes have killed acquisition efficiency for countless fashion brands overnight.

**Risk mitigation plan:**

**Immediate diversification**: Accelerate your Google Search investment from 20% to 30% if social performance drops. Search is platform-stable and captures high-intent traffic.

**First-party data priority**: Build email/SMS lists aggressively. Aim for 30-40% of new customers to opt-in. This creates owned audience for direct marketing if social targeting degrades.

**Creative hedge**: Develop platform-agnostic creative assets. Your work-to-evening concept works equally well in Google Video campaigns, Pinterest, or even LinkedIn if you need to pivot quickly.

**Performance monitoring**: Set weekly efficiency alerts. If Instagram CAC rises 20% week-over-week, immediately reallocate 10% budget to Google while investigating.

**Backup channel prep**: Keep Pinterest Shopping and LinkedIn campaigns ready to launch. Both serve professional women and could absorb redirected budget within days.

Your hybrid approach with influencers also provides some platform independence - relationships transcend algorithm changes.

You now have a complete media plan: clear objectives, realistic economics, defined audience, strategic geography, optimized channels, measurement framework, testing roadmap, and risk mitigation. Ready to execute?
