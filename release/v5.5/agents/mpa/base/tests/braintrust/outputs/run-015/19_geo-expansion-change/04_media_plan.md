# Media Plan Output: Geography Expansion Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

I can see you want 500,000 store visits and online conversions combined with a $2.5M budget. That's $5 per visit/conversion, which is quite efficient for athletic apparel where typical runs $8-15.

To define success clearly: what's your primary business outcome - are you focused on driving immediate sales, building brand awareness, or acquiring new customers for long-term value?

Turn 2:
Perfect - immediate sales with brand awareness layering. For your primary success metric, which number will you track most closely: total revenue generated, number of transactions, or something else? 

With athletic apparel's dual online/retail model, I want to make sure we're measuring what matters most to your business goals.

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - total revenue as your north star makes perfect sense. 

What's your revenue target for this $2.5M media investment? This will help us determine if your efficiency expectations align with athletic apparel benchmarks and ensure we're building toward a realistic goal.

Turn 4:
Let me model this. $2.5M budget targeting $10-12M revenue = 4x-4.8x ROAS. At $180 AOV, that's 55K-67K transactions, meaning $38-45 cost per transaction.

This is aggressive for athletic apparel. Market typically shows 3x-4x ROAS, and transaction costs usually run $50-80. You're targeting 25-50% better efficiency than benchmarks.

To hit these numbers, we'll need precise audience targeting and high-performing channels. Before we assess feasibility further - what's your gross margin on that $180 average order? This determines how much you can actually invest per customer acquisition.

Turn 5:
Perfect. At 42.5% margin on $180 AOV, you're making ~$76 per transaction. Your target $38-45 acquisition cost leaves $31-38 profit per transaction - healthy unit economics.

However, the efficiency gap remains significant. At typical $60-70 transaction costs for athletic apparel, you'd generate $6-8M revenue instead of your $10-12M target. To bridge this gap requires either:

1. Exceptional audience precision to beat benchmarks by 30%+
2. Increasing budget to ~$3.5M for your revenue goals
3. Accepting $8-10M as a more conservative target

Your margins support aggressive acquisition, but the math suggests recalibrating expectations or budget. Which direction makes most sense - tighter targeting strategy, more budget, or adjusted revenue goals?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 7:
Excellent targeting - CrossFit/functional fitness with $100-150K income is a much tighter segment than general "active adults." This precision could absolutely drive your efficiency targets.

Let me size this audience. CrossFit participants represent roughly 0.5-1% of US adults, with your income bracket being ~20% of population. Overlapping these signals suggests ~0.1-0.3% of total US population, or roughly 250K-750K people nationally.

At 55K-67K transaction targets, you'd need to convert 8-25% of this entire addressable audience. That's extremely high penetration for a single brand.

Are you open to expanding beyond pure CrossFit to include broader functional fitness, HIIT, or strength training enthusiasts? Or do you have data showing higher addressable audience size for your core segment?

Turn 8:
Perfect expansion strategy - HIIT and functional strength training share that performance mindset while giving us needed scale.

Broadening to include HIIT and functional strength enthusiasts roughly triples your addressable audience to ~750K-2M people nationally. At your 55K-67K transaction targets, that's a more achievable 3-9% penetration rate.

This audience expansion maintains brand authenticity while creating realistic path to your revenue goals. The shared values around performance, technical innovation, and gym-to-street versatility keep messaging consistent.

Now for geography - are you planning national coverage, or do you want to focus on specific markets where CrossFit/functional fitness has higher concentration? Markets like Denver, Austin, San Diego typically over-index for this audience.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Smart approach - proving efficiency before scaling is solid strategy. Your confidence in brand resonance with active adults gives us a strong foundation.

Let's get surgical about your audience. Beyond "active adults 25-45," what specific behaviors or characteristics define your highest-value customers? Think about their fitness activities, shopping patterns, lifestyle signals, or how they currently discover athletic brands.

This precision will be crucial to hitting that ambitious $38-45 acquisition cost target.

Turn 9:
Excellent geographic strategy. That 70/30 split allows broad brand building while concentrating firepower where your audience over-indexes.

Let me break down your $2.5M budget: $1.75M for national reach and $750K for premium metros. In markets like Denver, Austin, San Diego, your functional fitness audience is 2-3x denser, so that concentrated spend should drive stronger efficiency.

Your premium metro budget of $750K targeting roughly 15-20% of your total addressable audience creates good investment density for optimization.

Now for your value proposition - beyond technical fabrics and gym-to-street versatility, what specific message will differentiate ActiveWear Pro from competitors like Lululemon, Under Armour, or Alo? What makes someone choose your brand over established players?

Turn 10:
Strong positioning - performance engineering by athletes for athletes creates clear differentiation from lifestyle-focused competitors.

Your value proposition of "most technically advanced, purpose-built for serious functional fitness" speaks directly to your CrossFit/HIIT audience's performance mindset. That authenticity gap versus fashion-forward brands like Alo gives you real competitive advantage.

Now let's build your channel strategy. With $1.75M national and $750K premium metros, plus your tech-savvy audience that follows fitness influencers on Instagram/YouTube - which digital channels are you currently considering? I want to map the right platforms to your audience behaviors and efficiency targets.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 11:
Smart channel selection - Instagram and YouTube align perfectly with your audience's influencer engagement patterns. The long-form YouTube content for gear education is particularly strong for your technical positioning.

Let me model your mix. With your $38-45 acquisition cost target, here's what matters:

**Instagram**: Typically $40-80 CPM, strong for CrossFit targeting
**YouTube**: $20-40 CPM, excellent for performance content 
**Programmatic**: $5-15 CPM, but targeting precision is critical
**Search**: $2-8 CPC, captures high-intent gear shoppers

Your concern about "generic fitness traffic" is spot-on. Programmatic needs behavioral layering (CrossFit gym visits, functional fitness app usage) beyond basic fitness interest.

For your efficiency targets, I'd suggest 40% YouTube/Instagram for precision, 35% search for intent capture, 25% programmatic with tight behavioral targeting. Does this allocation align with your channel priorities?

Turn 13:
You're absolutely right - basic attribution likely undervalues digital impact on store visits. For athletic apparel, research-online-purchase-offline behavior is significant, especially for your high-involvement technical gear purchases.

Your current approach captures maybe 30-40% of true digital influence. Here's what we need:

**Immediate fixes**: Enhanced promo codes, store associate training, post-purchase surveys asking "how did you hear about us?"

**Medium-term**: Location-based attribution (SafeGraph, Veraset) to connect ad exposure to store visits, incrementality testing with geo-holdouts

**Advanced**: Customer journey mapping through loyalty program data, connecting digital touchpoints to in-store purchases

Given your $10-12M revenue target relies heavily on in-store sales, measurement gaps could make successful campaigns appear unsuccessful. Should we build in a 40-50% attribution uplift assumption, or focus on testable approaches first?

Turn 14:
Smart, data-driven approach. Building measurement infrastructure first prevents optimizing against incomplete signals.

For testing framework, I'd recommend starting with geo-holdout tests in 2-3 premium metros from your target list. Run digital campaigns in Denver/Austin, hold out San Diego as control, then measure store traffic lift. This gives you clean incrementality reads within 4-6 weeks.

Layer in enhanced promo codes and post-purchase surveys immediately - low cost, quick implementation.

Now for risks - with your aggressive efficiency targets and measurement gaps, what's your biggest concern? Is it the 30%+ efficiency improvement needed versus benchmarks, the attribution challenge, or something else that could derail this plan?

Turn 15:
Your concern is well-founded and shows strong strategic thinking. Targeting 4x-4.8x ROAS when market delivers 3x-4x is genuinely aggressive - you're asking for 20-60% outperformance.

Here's a risk mitigation approach:

**Phase 1 (Months 1-3)**: Test precision targeting with 30% of budget ($750K). Prove efficiency in controlled environment before scaling.

**Success criteria**: Hit $40-45 acquisition cost in test phase
**Backup plan**: If tests show $55-65 costs (market typical), adjust revenue target to $8-10M or request budget increase

**Leadership communication**: Frame as "proving precision targeting efficiency before full deployment" rather than promising immediate 4.8x ROAS.

This protects you from under-delivery while building evidence for what's achievable. Would you prefer this phased validation approach, or do you have other ideas for managing the efficiency risk?

Turn 16:
Perfect - you've built a solid, defensible media plan. The phased approach protects against efficiency risk while maintaining your ambitious vision.

**Your Plan Summary:**
- **Objective**: $10-12M revenue via precision targeting
- **Test Phase**: $750K over 3 months, targeting $40-45 acquisition cost
- **Audience**: CrossFit/HIIT/functional fitness, $100-150K income
- **Geography**: 70% national ($1.75M), 30% premium metros ($750K)
- **Channels**: 40% YouTube/Instagram, 35% search, 25% behavioral programmatic
- **Measurement**: Geo-holdout tests, enhanced attribution, incrementality validation
- **Risk Management**: Backup targets of $8-10M revenue if efficiency tests show market-typical performance

This gives you a data-driven story for leadership: "We're testing precision targeting to unlock 4.8x ROAS, with proven fallback scenarios if market conditions require adjustment."

You're ready to execute with both ambition and realism built in. Strong work building this plan together!

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 12:
Excellent question - programmatic precision is critical for your efficiency targets.

For behavioral layering beyond basic fitness interest, we'll stack these signals:

**Gym/Location Data**: Visits to CrossFit boxes, functional fitness studios, not just general gyms
**App Usage**: MyFitnessPal with strength training logs, CrossFit-specific apps like SugarWOD
**Purchase Behavior**: Previous buys from Rogue Fitness, Rep Fitness, other performance gear brands
**Content Consumption**: Engagement with CrossFit Games content, functional fitness YouTube channels
**Search History**: Queries for "WODs," "functional fitness," "performance apparel" vs generic "workout clothes"

We'll require 3-4 signal overlap minimum to avoid fitness-curious audiences who won't convert at your price points.

Now for measurement - with your dual online/in-store model and $10-12M revenue target, how are you currently tracking in-store conversions driven by digital media? This attribution gap could significantly impact your ROAS calculations.

Turn 18:
You're very welcome! It was great working through this with you. Your instinct to prove precision targeting efficiency before full deployment is exactly the right approach - it shows strategic maturity and protects your team's credibility.

The methodical build from audience precision to channel strategy to risk mitigation gives you a plan that's both ambitious and executable. Your leadership team should appreciate the data-driven validation approach.

Wishing you success with the testing phase and the bigger rollout!

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 17:
Excellent! You've built a thoughtful, defensible plan that balances ambition with smart risk management. The phased approach gives you credible data to either scale success or pivot intelligently.

For your leadership presentation, you have a compelling narrative: precision targeting backed by testing, clear efficiency benchmarks, and realistic backup scenarios. That's exactly what executives want to see.

Best of luck with the execution - your strategic approach to proving efficiency before scaling should serve you well. You've got this!
