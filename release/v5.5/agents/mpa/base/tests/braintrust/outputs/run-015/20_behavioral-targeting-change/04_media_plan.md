# Media Plan Output: Behavioral Targeting Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by recalculating your efficiency target: $800K ÷ 50K subscribers = $16 per subscriber. With $420 LTV, that's a 26:1 LTV/CAC ratio - extremely conservative and highly achievable for subscription nutrition.

Your business outcome is clear: acquire 50K new subscribers. How do you define success beyond subscriber count? Are you tracking specific metrics like 90-day retention rate, average order frequency, or subscription duration?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect. So success is 50K new subscribers with 40% staying past 90 days (up from 35% baseline). That's 20K retained subscribers as your quality benchmark.

Your $16 acquisition cost is very conservative - subscription nutrition typically runs $25-50. This gives you significant room to target higher-intent audiences that should naturally drive better retention.

Quick validation: at $16 CAC with $420 LTV, you're profitable on day one even with current 35% retention. The 40% target makes this extremely robust.

Step 1 complete. Now for economics - you mentioned $420 LTV. What timeframe does that represent, and do you have visibility into contribution margin per subscriber?

Turn 3:
Got it. I'll model at 55% contribution margin - that's $231 per subscriber over two years. At $16 CAC, you're generating 14.4:1 contribution margin to acquisition cost ratio, which is exceptionally strong.

This conservative efficiency target actually works in your favor for retention. You can afford to target higher-intent, more expensive audiences who are more likely to stick past 90 days. Premium targeting that costs $25-30 per subscriber would still be highly profitable while potentially driving that 40% retention goal.

Your economics are solid and support the retention objective. Ready to move to audience definition, or do you want to refine any of these economics assumptions first?

Turn 4:
Excellent. Let's build an audience strategy that drives both acquisition and retention.

Your current "fitness enthusiasts 25-55" is quite broad - roughly 15-20M people in the US. For endurance nutrition specifically, we can get much more precise to target people likely to stick with subscriptions.

Since retention is critical, I'm thinking we layer in behavioral signals beyond basic fitness interest. People who engage with endurance content, follow marathon training, or purchase performance supplements regularly show higher commitment levels.

What specific endurance activities do your best long-term subscribers typically participate in? Are we talking runners, cyclists, triathletes, or a broader mix?

Turn 5:
Perfect insight. Triathletes and marathon runners are ideal - they have structured training cycles that create consistent nutrition needs, making them natural subscription customers.

This targeting dramatically improves your retention prospects. These athletes typically:
- Train year-round with predictable nutrition windows
- Invest 12-18 months preparing for events
- View nutrition as performance infrastructure, not optional

Audience size drops to roughly 2-3M people, but quality increases substantially. These users likely convert at higher rates and stick longer than general fitness enthusiasts.

For the 25-55 age range - do you see meaningful retention differences between younger athletes (25-35) who might be newer to endurance sports versus older athletes (45-55) who are more established in their routines?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Excellent data point. Let's refine to 35-45 as the core demographic - that's your retention goldmine. These established professionals have the perfect combination of commitment, income, and performance focus.

This gives us roughly 600K-800K people nationwide: triathletes and marathon runners aged 35-45. Much tighter audience, but these are exactly the subscribers who'll hit your 40% retention target.

We could potentially add 30-35 and 45-50 as secondary segments if we need more volume, but the core 35-45 group should be prioritized in budget allocation.

Are there any additional behavioral signals that identify your best subscribers? For example, do they typically train for specific race distances, follow particular training philosophies, or engage with certain brands or content?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Perfect. Now we have a precision audience profile:

**Primary Target:** Triathletes and marathon runners, 35-45, training for Ironman/full marathon distances, following structured plans (TrainingPeaks), engaging with Strava, Outside Magazine, and endurance podcasts.

This is roughly 200K-300K people - small but extremely high-intent. At your conservative $16 CAC, you could afford to spend $25-30 to reach these premium prospects and likely exceed your 40% retention target.

**Secondary expansion:** 30-35 and 45-50 age brackets with same behavioral signals adds another 400K-500K for volume if needed.

The behavioral signals (TrainingPeaks, Strava engagement, endurance content consumption) are excellent retention predictors since they indicate serious, long-term commitment to the sport.

Ready to move to geography, or should we refine any audience segments further?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Excellent geographic strategy. Those metros have 3-5x higher concentrations of your target audience compared to national average. Boulder, SF, Boston, NYC, and Chicago are endurance sport epicenters with established training communities.

This geographic focus should significantly improve both conversion rates and retention - these markets have year-round training cultures and premium supplement adoption. Your $16 CAC might actually deliver even better efficiency in these concentrated markets.

Starting with 5 metros gives you roughly 40K-60K of your precision audience - enough to test and optimize before expanding. If performance is strong, logical expansion markets would be Seattle, Portland, Austin, and DC.

This completes our audience and geography foundation. Your budget allocation will likely skew 60-70% to these core metros initially.

Ready to move into budget allocation across these markets, or do you want to add any geographic considerations?

Turn 9:
Smart allocation approach. Let me model this out:

$800K total budget
- 65% to 5 core metros = $520K 
- 35% for expansion/testing = $280K

For the $520K metro allocation, I'd suggest weighting based on endurance density:
- Boston: 25% ($130K) - Marathon culture + high retention demographics
- San Francisco: 25% ($130K) - Premium triathlon community  
- NYC: 20% ($104K) - Largest absolute volume
- Chicago: 15% ($78K) - Strong marathon community
- Boulder: 15% ($78K) - Highest density but smaller population

This gives you roughly 8K-12K target prospects per major metro - sufficient scale for optimization while maintaining efficiency.

The remaining $280K provides flexibility to expand into Seattle, Portland, Austin, or scale up top performers.

Does this allocation align with your market prioritization, or should we adjust the metro weighting?

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Great - budget allocation is locked. Before we dive into channels in Step 7, let's quickly address your value proposition in Step 6. 

Your messaging strategy will be crucial for that 40% retention goal. These serious athletes respond to performance-focused, evidence-based positioning rather than generic fitness messaging.

Given you're targeting structured trainers preparing for Ironman/marathon distances, what's your core value proposition? Are you positioning as the science-backed nutrition system for peak performance, the convenient fuel solution for busy training schedules, or something else that resonates specifically with this committed athlete mindset?

Turn 11:
Perfect positioning for your audience. "Precision nutrition system for marginal gains" speaks directly to serious endurance athletes who obsess over performance optimization. The clinical research backing is crucial for this evidence-driven demographic.

This positioning should drive strong retention because it frames EnduraFuel as essential training infrastructure rather than optional supplementation. Athletes who buy into "scientifically calibrated performance enhancement" are more likely to stick with the subscription through training cycles.

Key messaging pillars locked:
- Science-driven precision nutrition system
- Engineered for marginal gains
- Clinical research validated
- Performance optimization, not just fuel

This sets us up perfectly for channel strategy. These athletes consume content differently than casual fitness enthusiasts - they're research-focused and trust peer recommendations.

Ready for Step 7 - channel selection? We'll map the best platforms to reach your precision audience with this performance-focused messaging.
