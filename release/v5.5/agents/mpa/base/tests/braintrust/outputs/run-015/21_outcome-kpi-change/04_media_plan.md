# Media Plan Output: Outcome KPI Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by modeling your efficiency target. $5M ÷ 25,000 = $200 per policy acquisition. With $2,800 LTV, that's a 14:1 LTV:CAC ratio - very healthy for insurance where 8-12:1 is typical.

Your objective is clear: 25,000 new policy acquisitions. How do you define a successful policy acquisition - is it when someone signs up, makes first payment, or completes underwriting?

Turn 2:
Perfect. First premium payment is the right success metric - that's when you have a real customer and can measure true CAC.

So we have:
- **Objective**: 25,000 new policy acquisitions 
- **Primary KPI**: Policies with first premium paid
- **Target volume**: 25,000 policies
- **Efficiency target**: $200 CAC with $2,800 LTV (14:1 ratio)

Your economics look strong. At $200 CAC vs typical insurance $150-250, you're positioned well. The 14:1 LTV:CAC ratio gives you excellent unit economics - most insurers target 8-12:1.

Ready to move to Step 2 - Economics. What's your average profit margin per policy after claims, operations, and servicing costs?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it. I'll model using 27.5% margin based on your estimate - that's reasonable for insurance after claims and operations. You can refine anytime.

At 27.5% margin on $2,800 LTV, that's $770 profit per customer. With your $200 CAC target, you're looking at $570 net profit per acquisition - excellent unit economics that support sustainable growth.

Your efficiency target of $200 CAC is achievable for insurance. Based on industry benchmarks, homeowner insurance CAC typically runs $150-250, so you're right in the sweet spot.

Moving to Step 3 - Audience. You mentioned homeowners 35-65 with $100K+ income during life events. What's the estimated size of your addressable market in your target geography?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
I'll model using 13.5 million households based on your research. That gives you a large addressable market - at 25,000 acquisitions, you'd be capturing 0.19% market share, which is very realistic for a focused campaign.

Your geographic instincts are solid. CA, TX, FL, and Northeast corridor represent about 60% of high-income homeowners nationally and have the population density to support efficient media buying.

For your audience definition, you mentioned three life event triggers: home purchase, new baby, and approaching retirement. These create different behavioral signals and media consumption patterns. 

Which of these three life events represents your highest-converting segment currently?

Turn 5:
Excellent insight. Home purchase as your primary trigger makes strategic sense - new homeowners have immediate, urgent insurance needs and higher intent.

With 35-40% higher conversion rates, we should weight your audience targeting heavily toward recent home buyers. This also creates clear behavioral signals for digital targeting: mortgage applications, real estate searches, home improvement purchases.

For your 13.5M addressable market, what percentage do you estimate are recent home buyers (purchased within last 12-18 months) versus the broader homeowner population you could target?

Turn 6:
Perfect. Let me model this audience prioritization:

**Primary Audience**: 2.25M recent home buyers (15-18 month window)
- Higher conversion rates (35-40% lift)
- Immediate insurance needs
- Clear digital behavioral signals

**Secondary Audience**: 11.25M broader homeowner market
- Standard conversion rates
- Longer consideration cycles
- Requires different messaging approach

At 25,000 target acquisitions, if you focused 70% of effort on recent buyers, you'd need 0.78% penetration of that segment - very achievable given their high intent.

Moving to Step 4 - Geography. You mentioned CA, TX, FL, and Northeast as key markets. Do you want to target all major DMAs nationally, or focus on specific metro areas where your conversion data shows strongest performance?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Smart geographic strategy. Those five metro areas represent high-income density and proven performance for you.

Let me model the concentration:
- **Primary DMAs** (60-70% of $5M): SF Bay, DFW, Miami-Fort Lauderdale, Boston, NYC
- **Secondary expansion**: Remaining metros nationally

These five metros contain roughly 25% of your 2.25M recent home buyer audience but likely drive 40%+ of your conversions based on income concentration and performance data.

At 65% budget focus ($3.25M) in primary DMAs, you'd have stronger frequency and optimization data in proven markets while maintaining national reach with remaining 35%.

Ready for Step 5 - Budget allocation. How do you want to split your $5M between audience acquisition and retention/cross-sell to existing customers?

Turn 8:
Got it. $4.25M for new acquisition gives you $170 CAC ($4.25M ÷ 25,000), which is even more efficient than your original $200 target - excellent positioning for insurance.

Let me model the geographic split of that $4.25M acquisition budget:
- **Primary DMAs** (65%): $2.76M across SF Bay, DFW, Miami, Boston, NYC
- **Secondary markets** (35%): $1.49M for national expansion

At $170 CAC, this projects to strong market penetration in your proven metros while building presence nationally.

Moving to Step 6 - Value Proposition. Given your focus on recent home buyers, what's your core message that differentiates TrustGuard from competitors when someone just bought their first or new home?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Excellent positioning. "Modern, tech-enabled protection for your most important asset" resonates strongly with new homeowners who expect digital-first experiences and personalized service.

Your differentiation around flexible coverage and faster claims processing addresses real pain points - new homeowners often feel overwhelmed by standard one-size-fits-all policies.

This value prop supports premium positioning, which aligns well with your $100K+ income targeting and healthy unit economics at $170 CAC.

Moving to Step 7 - Channels. With your audience of recent home buyers and geographic focus on high-income metros, which digital channels are you currently using, and what's working best for customer acquisition?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Strong foundation. LinkedIn and Facebook with lookalikes are smart for high-income targeting, and real estate/home improvement contextual targeting captures perfect intent moments.

Let me analyze your $4.25M acquisition budget against channel performance:

**Current high-performers**: LinkedIn, Facebook lookalikes, contextual programmatic
**Selective investment**: Google Search (high CPCs but quality traffic)

Given your $170 CAC target and recent home buyer focus, I'd recommend this mix:
- **40%** Paid Social (LinkedIn/Facebook optimized)
- **25%** Search (selective high-intent keywords) 
- **20%** Programmatic (real estate/home contextual)
- **15%** Testing allocation for expansion

This would put $1.7M in your proven social channels, $1.06M in search, $850K in contextual display.

Does this allocation align with your current performance data, or should we adjust based on what's driving your best $170 acquisitions?
