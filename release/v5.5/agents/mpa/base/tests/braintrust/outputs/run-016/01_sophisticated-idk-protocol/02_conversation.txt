USER:
Hey, I'm the growth lead at QuickSend. We're a remittance fintech looking to acquire 10,000 new users this quarter with a $500K media spend. Let's build out the media strategy.

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start - you want 10,000 new users with $500K spend. That's $50 per user acquisition cost. For remittance fintech, this is aggressive but achievable with tight execution - typical CAC runs $60-100 in this vertical.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 10,000 users? Are you focused on transaction volume, revenue growth, or market share expansion?

TURN 2 (Step 3)

USER:
We're primarily focused on revenue growth. Our investors want to see us increase total transaction volume and average transaction size, which means acquiring users who are more likely to send larger remittances, particularly from the US to Latin America. Our current strategy is to target professionals and first-generation immigrants who have stable income and regular international financial obligations.

AGENT:
Excellent - revenue growth through higher-value users is a strong strategic focus. Let me update our efficiency target.

For remittance, assuming 2-3% transaction fees, you'd need users averaging $1,667-2,500 in monthly volume to justify $50 CAC. That's achievable with your target of professionals and first-generation immigrants.

How do you define success numerically? What's your primary KPI - total transaction volume, revenue per user, or something else? And what's your specific target number for this quarter?
