TURN 1 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Hi! I'm looking to get more people to buy shoes from our online store. Can you help me figure out the best way to do that?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What business outcome are you trying to achieve? For example, are you looking to get more customers, increase sales from existing customers, or launch a new shoe line?

TURN 2 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We want to get more new customers buying our shoes online. Right now we're mostly selling through our website, and I want to grow our customer base and increase overall sales. I think we have a good product, but we need more people to know about StepRight Shoes.

AGENT:
Perfect! Growing your customer base is a clear objective. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success.

What specific number would show you're winning? For example, are you targeting a certain number of new customers, a sales revenue goal, or something else measurable?

TURN 3 (Step 3)

USER:
I'm not totally sure about specific numbers. I know we want to grow, but we haven't set a precise target. Maybe around 500 new customers this year? That seems like a good start for us. Our team hasn't really nailed down the exact goal yet, but we want to definitely increase our online sales and get more people knowing about StepRight Shoes.

AGENT:
Got it. For shoe retailers, 500 new customers annually is a solid starting goal. Let me model at 500 customers and you can adjust anytime.

What's your budget for getting those 500 new customers? This helps us figure out how much you can spend per customer and if that's realistic for the shoe business.

TURN 4 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We have about $250,000 to spend this year on marketing. I'm hoping that budget will help us reach our customer growth target. I'm not totally sure about the math, but I think we want to spend efficiently and get the most people learning about StepRight Shoes.

AGENT:
Let me update our projections. $250,000 ÷ 500 customers = $500 per customer. 

That's quite generous for shoe retail, where cost per customer typically runs $50-80. This gives you excellent flexibility - you could either target many more customers with that budget, or invest heavily in premium channels to build strong brand awareness.

To make sure this works, what's a typical shoe sale worth to you? For example, if someone buys a pair of shoes, what do you usually make in profit?

TURN 5 (Step 2)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I'm not totally sure about our exact profit per shoe. We sell shoes around $120-$150, and I think we make something like $50-60 in profit per pair, but I'd have to check with our finance team to get the precise number. We definitely want to make sure we're making money on each sale.

AGENT:
Perfect. For shoe retailers, profit margins typically run 40-50%. Let me model at $55 profit per sale. You can adjust anytime.

Here's what this means: at $500 per customer and $55 profit per sale, you'd need each customer to buy about 9 pairs of shoes to break even. That's quite high for most shoe businesses, where customers typically buy 1-2 pairs initially.

This suggests either targeting many more customers with your budget, or focusing on building long-term customer relationships. Do your customers typically come back and buy multiple pairs over time, or are most purchases one-time?
