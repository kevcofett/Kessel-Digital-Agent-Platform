# Media Plan Output: High-Stakes Performance Campaign

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with the math on what you've shared: $2M ÷ 50,000 merchants = $40 per merchant acquisition cost. With $850 LTV, that's a 21.25x return - excellent unit economics for fintech.

For outcomes: You want to acquire 50,000 new merchants. How do you define success beyond just merchant count? Are you focused on transaction volume, active merchants after 90 days, or revenue milestones?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Let me update our model with this data:

**Success Framework:**
- Primary KPI: 35,000 active merchants (70% of 50,000) processing $10K+ monthly at 90 days
- Revenue target: $42M new ARR 
- Volume target: $50K average monthly processing per merchant

**The Math:**
$42M ARR ÷ 50,000 merchants = $840 annual revenue per merchant, which aligns closely with your $850 LTV. At $50K monthly processing and typical 2-3% transaction fees, that's $12K-18K annual revenue per merchant - meaning you need your highest-value merchants to hit the revenue target.

Your $40 CAC against $840+ annual value gives you a 21x+ return, which is very strong for B2B fintech.

Now for economics validation: With transaction-based revenue, your actual merchant value varies significantly. Do you have data on what percentage of acquired merchants typically reach that $50K monthly processing level, or should I model using fintech benchmarks?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it. I'll model using 42% hitting $50K monthly processing based on your portfolio data. You can adjust anytime.

**Updated Reality Check:**
- 50,000 acquired merchants × 42% = 21,000 reaching $50K monthly processing
- This creates a bimodal value distribution: high-value merchants driving most revenue
- Your $42M ARR target requires the remaining 29,000 merchants to average ~$700 ARR each

**Risk Assessment:**
At 42% success rate, your blended merchant value drops significantly below the $840 target. If only 21,000 hit $50K processing ($12K-18K ARR each), you'd need the other 29,000 to contribute meaningfully to reach $42M total.

This suggests your $40 CAC is actually quite aggressive - you're betting on acquiring the right merchant mix. The plan is achievable but requires precise targeting toward merchants likely to scale quickly.

What's your average transaction fee percentage, and do you have insight into what merchant characteristics predict higher processing volumes?

Turn 4:
Perfect. At 2.5-3% fees, your high-volume merchants ($50K monthly) generate $15K-18K ARR each - that's your economic engine.

**Refined Economics:**
- 21,000 high-volume merchants × $16.5K average ARR = $34.7M
- Need $7.3M from remaining 29,000 merchants = $252 ARR each
- This is achievable with lower-volume merchants averaging $8K-12K monthly processing

Your targeting insight is crucial: tech-enabled services, e-commerce, and professional consulting have predictable payment flows versus sporadic retail transactions. This suggests audience precision will make or break efficiency.

**Economics Assessment:** Your plan is realistic but requires disciplined targeting. The $40 CAC works if you can skew acquisition toward scalable merchant types. Miss the merchant mix, and you'll struggle to hit $42M ARR.

Step 2 complete - your unit economics are sound with proper targeting. Ready to define your ideal merchant audience, starting with those high-value segments you identified?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Excellent - you've identified the sweet spot. Let me capture your core audience framework:

**Primary Target:** Tech-enabled service businesses, e-commerce, and professional consulting processing $10K-100K monthly. These are digitally savvy entrepreneurs with scaling businesses who value sophisticated payment infrastructure.

Now let's get specific for targeting precision. Starting with firmographics:

**Business characteristics:** What company size ranges work best? Are you targeting solo entrepreneurs, small teams (2-10 employees), or growing companies up to 50+ employees? And do specific business ages perform better - startups in year 2-5, or does it vary by vertical?

Turn 6:
Perfect targeting profile emerging:

**Core Demographics:**
- 2-15 employees (scaling past startup phase)
- Years 3-7 in business (proven market fit, professionalizing)
- Processing $10K-100K monthly
- Focus: E-commerce and software services as highest-converting verticals

**Key Insight:** This eliminates early-stage risk and enterprise complexity - you're targeting the growth inflection point where payment infrastructure becomes a real business need.

For behavioral signals: How do these businesses currently handle payments before switching to you? Are they outgrowing basic processors like Square/Stripe, frustrated with multiple payment tools, or dealing with specific pain points like international transactions or complex fee structures?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Smart geographic strategy - you're balancing proven tech ecosystems with emerging opportunity markets.

**Primary Markets:** SF, NYC, Austin, Seattle, Boston (established tech hubs)
**Expansion Markets:** Denver, Atlanta, Miami (emerging scenes, less competition)

This creates an interesting budget allocation question. Established markets have higher merchant density but likely higher acquisition costs due to competition. Emerging markets may offer better efficiency but require more education.

**Geographic Targeting Complete.** Your audience is well-defined: 2-15 employee businesses in years 3-7, processing $10K-100K monthly, concentrated in 8 major metros, frustrated with basic payment processors.

Ready for Step 5 - Budget allocation? We need to decide how to distribute your $2M across these 8 markets and whether to weight toward proven markets or emerging opportunities for maximum merchant acquisition efficiency.

Turn 9:
Excellent allocation strategy. Let me model this:

**Geographic Budget Split:**
- Primary markets: $1.4M ÷ 5 cities = $280K per market (SF, NYC, Austin, Seattle, Boston)
- Expansion markets: $600K ÷ 3 cities = $200K per market (Denver, Atlanta, Miami)

**Strategic Logic:** You're betting on proven conversion rates while maintaining meaningful expansion presence. At $200K per expansion market, you'll have enough budget for real testing and optimization.

**Efficiency Implications:** If primary markets run 25-30% higher CAC due to competition, you're looking at ~$50-55 CAC vs $35-40 in expansion markets. With 70% budget in higher-cost markets, your blended CAC rises to ~$45-48, which still works within your economics.

Now for value proposition: Your core message is "enterprise-grade payment features at mid-market pricing for growing businesses." How do you want to position this against the "outgrow Stripe/PayPal" pain points? More technical/feature-focused or business outcome-focused?

Turn 10:
Perfect positioning - outcomes over features for growth-focused entrepreneurs.

**Value Proposition Framework:**
- Lead message: Strategic payment partner for scaling businesses
- Core benefits: Streamlined operations, reduced transaction costs, sophisticated financial insights
- Differentiation: Understanding growth challenges vs. just processing payments

**Messaging Hierarchy:**
1. Business outcome (growth enablement)
2. Operational impact (streamlined, cost-effective)
3. Strategic partnership (not just vendor)
4. Technical capabilities (supporting evidence)

This resonates with your audience's mindset - they're thinking about business scaling, not payment infrastructure details.

**Budget and Value Proposition Complete.** You have $2M allocated across 8 markets with clear outcome-focused messaging.

Ready for Step 7 - Channels? With your target audience of tech-savvy entrepreneurs in major metros, we need to identify the most efficient channels to reach businesses outgrowing basic payment processors. Where do these decision-makers typically discover and evaluate new payment solutions?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Excellent - now we have clear behavioral triggers for targeting:

**Pain Points Driving Switch:**
- Outgrowing Stripe/PayPal limitations (integration complexity)
- Transaction fees eroding margins at scale
- Need for sophisticated reporting and analytics
- API-level integration requirements (especially software services)
- Demand for custom payment workflows

**Your Value Wedge:** Enterprise-grade features at mid-market pricing for the 2-15 employee growth stage.

**Targeting Signals:** Businesses actively researching payment alternatives, comparing transaction fees, seeking API documentation, or discussing payment infrastructure challenges.

Now for geography: Are you targeting nationally, or do certain regions/metros perform better? Tech hubs like SF, Austin, NYC often have higher concentrations of your ideal profile, but may also have more competition.
