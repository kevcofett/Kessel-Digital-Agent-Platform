# Media Plan Output: Aggressive KPI - Must Narrow to Achieve

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me validate your economics first. $750K / 5,000 customers = $150 CAC target. With $2,400 LTV, that's a 16x ratio - excellent unit economics for B2B SaaS where 3-5x is typical.

Your $150 CAC target is aggressive but achievable. B2B SaaS typically runs $200-400 CAC for SMB segments, so you're targeting 25-50% better efficiency than market average. This will require precise targeting and channel optimization.

Your primary objective appears to be customer acquisition. Is your main success metric the 5,000 new customers, or are you also tracking specific revenue milestones from these acquisitions?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect. Let me update the projections. 5,000 customers generating $15-18M ARR means $3,000-$3,600 average contract value, which aligns with your $2,400 LTV at reasonable churn rates.

Your primary KPI is 5,000 new customers with $150 CAC efficiency. Secondary metric is $15-18M new ARR. The math validates: $750K investment targeting $16.5M ARR midpoint delivers 22x return.

Your $150 CAC target is 25-40% more efficient than typical $200-300 for SMB logistics software. Based on industry benchmarks, this is aggressive but achievable with tight audience definition and optimized channels. You'll need surgical precision on that "stuck on spreadsheets" pain point.

Step 1 complete - clear objective and realistic volume target despite aggressive efficiency requirements.

Now for economics: With $2,400 LTV and $150 target CAC, what's your gross margin on the $3,000-$3,600 annual contracts? This affects how much cushion you have if acquisition costs run higher than target.

Turn 3:
Excellent. 70-75% gross margin gives you meaningful cushion. At 72.5% midpoint, you could handle CAC up to $200 and still maintain healthy 12x LTV ratios. That's critical for an aggressive efficiency target.

Your economics are solid: $150 target CAC with flexibility to $200, $2,400 LTV, and strong margins. This validates the $750K investment can realistically generate 5,000 customers.

Step 2 complete - economics support your aggressive targets with reasonable downside protection.

Now let's define your audience precisely. You mentioned SMB logistics managers at 50-500 employee companies with $5M-$50M revenue, stuck on spreadsheets or legacy TMS. 

Within that broad category, what specific pain points or use cases make companies most likely to switch to SwiftDeliver? Are there particular logistics challenges or operational triggers that create urgency?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Perfect targeting insight. Companies at 100-200 shipments/week hitting operational breaking points create high purchase intent. That "growth pain" moment is your conversion catalyst.

Let me refine the audience profile:
- SMB logistics managers, 50-500 employees, $5M-$50M revenue
- Currently 100-200 shipments/week experiencing scale breakdown
- Pain points: tracking chaos, inconsistent carrier rates, inefficient routing
- Timing trigger: current TMS failing but pre-enterprise complexity

This precision targeting is exactly what you need for $150 CAC efficiency. The more specific the pain point, the higher conversion rates.

For geographic targeting, are you focusing nationally or do certain regions have higher concentrations of your ideal logistics companies? Manufacturing hubs, distribution centers, or specific metro areas where SMB logistics companies cluster?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Smart geographic focus. Concentrating 60% of budget in proven markets - Southeast, Midwest, West Coast logistics hubs - maximizes efficiency. Those regions have the highest density of your ideal 100-200 shipments/week companies.

For the $750K budget, I'd model roughly:
- Southeast (Atlanta/Charlotte): ~35% = $262K  
- Midwest (Chicago/Indianapolis): ~25% = $188K
- West Coast (LA/Bay Area): ~25% = $188K
- Secondary markets/testing: ~15% = $112K

This allocation matches your current customer concentration while maintaining flexibility for expansion.

Given your $150 CAC target across 5,000 customers, how do you want to allocate budget between customer acquisition versus retention/expansion of existing accounts? Are these 5,000 net new logos, or does this include expansion within current accounts?

Turn 6:
Perfect. 5,000 net new logos from a 500-customer base means 10x growth - truly aggressive land-grab strategy. 

Budget allocation:
- 75% acquisition ($562K) targeting cold prospects
- 25% remarketing/nurture ($188K) for conversion optimization

This gives you $112 CAC for pure acquisition spend, requiring exceptional efficiency. The 25% remarketing budget provides crucial conversion support - B2B SaaS typically needs 7-12 touchpoints for enterprise software decisions.

Your value proposition needs to be razor-sharp for this efficiency. Based on your audience pain points - tracking chaos, rate shopping inconsistency, routing inefficiency at 100-200 shipments/week - what's your core differentiated benefit? What makes SwiftDeliver the obvious choice over continuing with broken spreadsheets or basic TMS systems?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 7:
Brilliant positioning. "Turn shipping from cost center to profit engine" with $500-$1,500 monthly savings is compelling ROI messaging. At your $3,000-$3,600 ACV, customers see payback in 2-3 months - that's enterprise-grade value at SMB pricing.

Your value proposition is perfectly aligned for $150 CAC efficiency: immediate financial impact, measurable ROI, and clear differentiation from static legacy systems.

Step 6 complete - strong value proposition with quantified benefit.

Now for channel strategy. Given your aggressive $112 acquisition CAC target and precise audience (SMB logistics managers experiencing shipment scale pain), which channels are you currently using or considering? Your B2B audience, geographic concentration, and efficiency requirements will drive specific channel recommendations.

Turn 8:
Solid channel foundation. LinkedIn + Google Search is the right core for B2B SaaS efficiency. Let me model your current mix and identify optimization opportunities.

Current channel assessment:
- **LinkedIn**: Excellent for your precise targeting (logistics managers, company size, pain points). Typical B2B SaaS CACs run $180-250, so you'll need tight audience segmentation
- **Google Search**: Perfect for intent capture. Non-brand keywords like "TMS software SMB" or "shipping optimization tools" should deliver $120-180 CACs
- **G2/Capterra**: High-intent but expensive ($200-400 CACs typical). Better for conversion assist than primary acquisition

For $150 blended CAC, I'd recommend:
- 50% Google Search ($281K) - highest intent, lowest CAC
- 35% LinkedIn ($196K) - precise targeting 
- 15% G2/Capterra + testing ($131K) - conversion support

This prioritizes your most efficient channels while maintaining review site presence for credibility.

What specific LinkedIn targeting parameters are you using currently, and what CACs are you seeing by channel?
