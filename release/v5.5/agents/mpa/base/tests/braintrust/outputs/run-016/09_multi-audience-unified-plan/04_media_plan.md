# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience Unified Media Plan

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've provided excellent segment detail upfront - that's going to make our planning much more precise. Let me start with your business outcome.

$3M budget for 25,000 enrollees = $120 per enrollee across all segments. For health insurance, that's aggressive - typical acquisition costs run $200-400 depending on plan value. This suggests we'll need tight targeting and efficient channel selection.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve beyond the enrollment numbers? Are you focused on total membership growth, market share in specific segments, or lifetime value optimization?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your primary objective is membership growth with risk pool diversification - getting younger members to balance actuarial risk. That's smart strategic thinking.

Let me recalculate based on your $120 per enrollee target. At typical health insurance acquisition costs of $200-400, you're targeting 50-70% below market. That's very aggressive and will require exceptional targeting precision and channel efficiency.

For your primary success metric, how do you want to measure progress? Is it simply total enrollees across all segments, or do you need specific enrollment targets by segment to achieve the risk balance you're after?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Let me recalculate the economics - this changes everything:

**LTV to CAC Ratios (First Year Only):**
- Young Professionals: $3,600 / $120 = 30:1 ratio
- Families: $6,200 / $150 = 41:1 ratio  
- Pre-Medicare: $8,400 / $171 = 49:1 ratio

These ratios are extraordinarily strong - even for just first-year value. Typical health insurance sees 3:1 to 6:1 ratios. Your targets suggest either massive profitability opportunity or the efficiency requirements are unrealistic.

For context, if industry benchmarks of $200-400 CAC applied to your premiums, you'd still have healthy 9:1 to 42:1 ratios.

A few critical questions: Are these gross premiums or your net revenue after medical costs? And what's your typical member retention rate year-over-year? Understanding true lifetime value will help us assess if we can invest more aggressively in acquisition while still hitting your growth targets.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent breakdown. Let me update our projections:

- Young Professionals: 10,000 enrollees = $120 per enrollee (40% of budget = $1.2M)
- Families: 8,000 enrollees = $150 per enrollee (32% of budget = $960K)  
- Pre-Medicare: 7,000 enrollees = $171 per enrollee (28% of budget = $840K)

This creates a tiered efficiency model where your strategic priority (young professionals) gets the most aggressive target at $120. Even your most expensive segment at $171 is still well below typical $200-400 benchmarks.

For health insurance, young professionals typically have the lowest acquisition costs due to digital behavior, but $120 is still aggressive. To hit these targets across all segments, we'll need surgical precision in targeting.

What's the average annual premium value for each segment? Understanding customer lifetime value will help us assess if these efficiency targets are sustainable.

Turn 5:
Perfect. With those retention rates, your true LTV multiples are even stronger:

**Multi-Year LTV (simplified 3-year view):**
- Young Professionals: ~$8,500 LTV vs $120 CAC = 71:1 ratio
- Families: ~$15,800 LTV vs $150 CAC = 105:1 ratio
- Pre-Medicare: ~$21,600 LTV vs $171 CAC = 126:1 ratio

These economics are exceptional and justify aggressive acquisition investment. Your $120-171 efficiency targets are actually conservative given the lifetime value.

This suggests we could potentially invest 2-3x more per acquisition and still maintain strong unit economics. However, I understand you want to hit 25,000 total enrollees within the $3M budget.

The key question becomes: Is the $120-171 efficiency achievable in-market, or should we model a more realistic acquisition cost and adjust volume expectations? For health insurance, even best-in-class digital acquisition typically runs $150-250 per enrollee.

Do you want to maintain the 25,000 volume target, or would you prefer to optimize for the highest-value mix even if total enrollments are lower?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 7:
Excellent decision. Let me update our projections for the $3.8M hybrid model:

**Revised Segment Targets (19,000 total enrollees):**
- Young Professionals: 7,600 enrollees × $175 = $1.33M (40% mix)
- Families: 6,080 enrollees × $200 = $1.216M (32% mix)  
- Pre-Medicare: 5,320 enrollees × $225 = $1.197M (28% mix)
- **Total: $3.743M** (within your $3.8M budget)

This maintains your strategic demographic balance while using realistic market efficiency. You're still achieving 35:1+ LTV ratios across all segments.

The 19,000 enrollees represent meaningful risk pool impact while creating a proven model for future scaling. Smart approach.

Now let's move to Step 3 - Audience definition. You've outlined three distinct segments, but we need to get more granular for targeting precision. 

Starting with Young Professionals: Beyond ages 26-35 in urban metros, what behavioral and lifestyle signals best identify your ideal health-conscious prospects?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Smart approach. Let me model realistic acquisition costs while maintaining your strategic segment mix:

**Revised Model at $200 blended CAC:**
- Young Professionals: 10,000 enrollees × $175 = $1.75M
- Families: 8,000 enrollees × $200 = $1.6M  
- Pre-Medicare: 7,000 enrollees × $225 = $1.575M
- **Total: $4.925M budget needed**

Your current $3M budget creates a 39% funding gap to hit realistic market efficiency.

**Options to consider:**
1. **Increase budget to $4.9M** - maintains volume and segment mix
2. **Reduce total volume to ~15,200 enrollees** - maintains mix within $3M budget
3. **Hybrid approach** - slightly increase budget to $3.8M, target ~19,000 enrollees

Given your strong LTV economics, option 1 makes the most business sense. Even at $200 blended CAC, you're still achieving 35:1+ LTV ratios.

Which direction feels most aligned with your strategic priorities and budget flexibility?

Turn 8:
Perfect targeting depth. Those behavioral signals create a highly targetable digital footprint. The wellness ecosystem - from fitness apps to organic purchasing - gives us multiple touchpoints for precise audience building.

For Families (ages 35-50 in suburban markets): What behavioral and lifestyle signals identify your ideal family prospects? Are we looking at specific parenting stages, healthcare usage patterns, or family activity indicators that signal they're ready to evaluate comprehensive coverage?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Excellent. Those life transition triggers - new homes, children, job changes - create natural enrollment windows with high intent. The family protection mindset drives comprehensive coverage preferences.

For Pre-Medicare (ages 55-64): What behavioral signals identify prospects approaching this critical transition? Are we targeting specific retirement planning behaviors, healthcare research patterns, or Medicare preparation activities that indicate readiness for bridge coverage?

Turn 10:
Excellent. The 2-3 year research window gives us a substantial targeting opportunity. The focus on network continuity and financial security creates clear messaging angles.

Now let's refine geography. You mentioned:
- Young Professionals: NYC, SF, LA, Chicago urban metros
- Families: Suburban markets around top 50 metros  
- Pre-Medicare: National but heavy in FL, AZ, TX

For targeting precision, do you want to focus on specific DMAs within these markets, or should we model broader metro coverage? Also, are there any geographic restrictions based on your network coverage or state regulations that would limit where we can acquire members?

Turn 11:
Perfect. Strong network alignment with targeting strategy maximizes member satisfaction and reduces churn.

**Geographic Focus Summary:**
- Young Professionals: 6 core DMAs (NYC, SF, Chicago, LA, Austin, Denver)
- Families: Midwest/Southeast metro DMAs with strong pediatric networks
- Pre-Medicare: Heavy FL/AZ/TX focus with national digital backup

Now for Step 5 - Budget allocation. With your $3.8M budget and geographic priorities, how do you want to weight spending across segments and markets?

Given your strategic priority on Young Professionals for risk pool balance, should we allocate more aggressively to those 6 core DMAs? Or do you prefer even distribution based on the enrollment targets we set: $1.33M Young Professionals, $1.216M Families, $1.197M Pre-Medicare?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 12:
Perfect adjustment. Let me update our budget allocation:

**Revised Budget Split (45/30/25):**
- Young Professionals: $1.71M (45%) targeting 9,771 enrollees = $175 CAC
- Families: $1.14M (30%) targeting 5,700 enrollees = $200 CAC  
- Pre-Medicare: $950K (25%) targeting 4,222 enrollees = $225 CAC
- **Total: $3.8M for 19,693 enrollees**

This gives you the strategic overweight on Young Professionals while maintaining realistic efficiency targets. The 6 core DMAs will get concentrated investment for maximum impact.

Now for Step 6 - Value Proposition. Each segment needs distinct messaging that resonates with their priorities.

For Young Professionals in those urban markets, what's your core value proposition? Is it the convenience and digital experience, the wellness alignment, or something else that differentiates you from competitors targeting health-conscious millennials?
