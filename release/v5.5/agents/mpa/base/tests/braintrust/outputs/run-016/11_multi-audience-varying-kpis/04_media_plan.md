# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience with Different KPIs Per Segment

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build this multi-segment media plan with you. This is sophisticated - three distinct objectives requiring different measurement frameworks and channel strategies. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks.

Your segment structure is smart: Conquest ($1.58M), In-Market ($2.03M), and Loyalty ($900K). Each needs different success metrics.

Let's start with Segment 1 - Conquest. You mentioned the goal is awareness for consideration shift 2-3 years out. What specific business outcome are you targeting? Are you measuring brand lift percentage, share of voice increase, or consideration shift among conquest prospects?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So Segment 1 success is measured by brand awareness lift (aided/unaided) and consideration expansion among competitive brand owners, with share of voice as a supporting metric.

For your $1.58M conquest budget targeting awareness lift, what's your target improvement? Are you looking for a specific percentage increase in unaided awareness, or do you have benchmark awareness levels you're trying to reach in your metro markets?

This will help determine if $1.58M can achieve meaningful lift against competitors who are outspending you.

Turn 4:
Let me update the projections. 800-1,000 leads monthly at $200 CPL = $160K-$200K monthly spend, or $1.9M-$2.4M annually. Your $2.03M budget sits right in that range - realistic for 850 average monthly leads.

The math works: 850 leads × 15% to test drives = 128 test drives × 20% close rate = 25-26 unit sales monthly from this segment. That's strong performance if you hit those conversion rates.

Now Segment 3 - Loyalty with $900K targeting retention actions. What's your target volume for service appointments, trade-in inquiries, or lease renewals? Do you have a cost-per-action target, or are you measuring this by customer lifetime value protection?

Turn 5:
Perfect. At $150 per action and 1,200 service appointments monthly, that's $180K monthly or $2.16M annually - but your loyalty budget is $900K. Either the $150 target is aggressive (actual cost around $62 per appointment) or you're prioritizing the highest-value retention actions within budget.

$900K / 1,200 monthly appointments = $62 per service appointment. For loyalty marketing, that's very efficient and achievable.

Now I have solid economics for all three segments. Before we move to audience definition, let me validate the overall efficiency targets:

**Conquest**: Brand lift measurement - harder to benchmark but $1.58M for metro awareness is tight
**In-Market**: $200 CPL for qualified auto leads - realistic for performance marketing  
**Loyalty**: $62 per service appointment - very achievable for existing customers

The In-Market segment math looks strongest. Conquest will need precise targeting. Loyalty economics work well.

What's your primary geographic focus? Are you concentrating on specific metro markets, or do you need coverage across all 12 dealership locations?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent. 25-30% to 45-50% unaided awareness is ambitious - that's a 67-80% relative increase. At $1.58M across metro markets, you'll need surgical precision on audience and high-frequency exposure to break through competitive clutter.

Now for Segment 2 - In-Market lead generation with $2.03M. You mentioned leads as the primary KPI - VDP views, form fills, calls, test drives. What's your target volume? Are you looking for a specific number of qualified leads per month, or do you have a cost-per-lead target that drives your volume expectations?

Turn 7:
Perfect targeting. Toyota/Honda/Nissan owners with 3-7 year old vehicles at $75K-$150K income are prime conquest prospects - they have equity, proven reliability expectations, and budget for upgrades.

Estimating audience size across your three DMAs:
- Toyota/Honda/Nissan ownership is roughly 35-40% market share
- 3-7 year vehicle age window captures ~40% of owners
- $75K-$150K income represents ~30% of households

This suggests roughly 400K-500K households in your conquest audience across Phoenix, Vegas, and Salt Lake. That's a solid audience size for $1.58M - allows meaningful frequency without oversaturation.

For your in-market segment targeting active shoppers, what behavioral signals are you prioritizing? Are you focusing on recent dealer visits, online research activity, or specific life events that trigger vehicle shopping?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Excellent. Three primary metros with 50-mile radius strategy makes sense for conquest and in-market efficiency. Loyalty being CRM-driven rather than geo-targeted is smart.

Let me map this out:

**Phoenix DMA**: Population ~5.1M
**Las Vegas DMA**: Population ~2.3M  
**Salt Lake City DMA**: Population ~1.3M
**Total Primary Coverage**: ~8.7M population

For conquest targeting, what defines your ideal competitive brand owner? Are you targeting specific competitor brands (Toyota, Honda, etc.), certain vehicle ages, or income/demographic profiles that indicate readiness to consider your brands?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Excellent intent signals. Website visits to auto research sites plus search activity creates a high-propensity audience. The 60-90 day purchase window is optimal for nurturing without being too early or late in the funnel.

Your behavioral targeting should generate a smaller but higher-converting audience than conquest - probably 50K-75K active shoppers across your three metros at any given time. At $2.03M, that allows aggressive frequency to stay top-of-mind during their research phase.

Now for your loyalty segment - you mentioned targeting existing customers from your CRM. What defines your priority retention audiences? Are you segmenting by service due dates, lease expiration timing, or customer lifetime value tiers?

Turn 9:
Perfect segmentation. Three distinct value-based tiers with tailored messaging will maximize retention efficiency. Service-due customers need convenience, lease-end customers need upgrade incentives, and VIP customers need recognition.

Your CRM-driven approach means precise targeting without geographic waste - much more efficient than broad loyalty campaigns.

Now let's establish your budget framework. You've allocated:
- **Conquest**: $1.58M (35%)
- **In-Market**: $2.03M (45%) 
- **Loyalty**: $900K (20%)

Within each segment, how do you want to allocate across your three metro markets? Should Phoenix get larger allocation given its size (~5.1M population vs Vegas 2.3M and Salt Lake 1.3M), or do you have market-specific priorities that override population weighting?

Turn 10:
Smart approach. Market-specific allocation by segment makes much more sense than uniform distribution.

Let me model this out:

**Phoenix (50-55% weighted)**:
- Conquest: ~$950K (60% given metro size)
- In-Market: ~$1.0M (50% - even shopper behavior)
- Loyalty: ~$450K (database concentration)

**Las Vegas (30%)**:
- Conquest: ~$475K
- In-Market: ~$610K
- Loyalty: ~$270K

**Salt Lake (15-20%)**:
- Conquest: ~$155K
- In-Market: ~$420K
- Loyalty: ~$180K

This gives Phoenix the aggressive conquest presence it needs while maintaining realistic in-market coverage across all three metros.

Now for value proposition - each segment needs distinct messaging. For conquest targeting competitive brand owners, what's your primary value proposition? Are you emphasizing technology upgrades, competitive pricing, or reliability parity with their current brands?

Turn 11:
Perfect positioning. "Next-Generation Performance, Competitive Pricing" directly challenges the perception that Toyota/Honda owners need to sacrifice innovation for reliability. Leading with tech leapfrogging is smart - it creates urgency around their current vehicle feeling outdated.

For your in-market segment targeting active shoppers, what's your primary value proposition? Are you emphasizing selection, service experience, financing options, or something else that differentiates your dealership group from competitors?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 12:
Excellent differentiation. "Complete Transparency, Simplified Purchase" directly addresses car buying pain points. The multi-brand advantage with consultative approach is compelling for research-mode shoppers who want options without pressure.

For your loyalty segment - existing customers getting service reminders, lease-end outreach, and VIP treatment - what's your retention value proposition? Are you emphasizing convenience, exclusive benefits, or relationship continuity?

Turn 13:
Perfect positioning. "Your Automotive Ecosystem" creates sticky relationships beyond transactions - predictive maintenance and seamless upgrade pathways build long-term value.

Now let's move to channels. With three distinct objectives and value propositions, each segment needs different channel strategies.

For **Conquest** ($1.58M targeting brand awareness lift among competitive owners), what channels are you considering? Given the need for frequency and brand building in metro markets, are you thinking video-heavy channels like Connected TV, YouTube, or traditional broadcast? Or do you prefer targeted digital display and social for precise audience reach?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 14:
Smart video-heavy approach. 60% video allocation = ~$950K across CTV, YouTube, and broadcast TV for awareness lift, with ~$630K in display/social for surround-sound exposure.

CTV and YouTube give you precise competitive owner targeting with brand lift measurement capabilities. Traditional broadcast adds metro reach at scale. The video emphasis supports your tech-forward messaging perfectly.

For **In-Market** ($2.03M targeting 800-1,000 qualified leads monthly), what channels are you prioritizing? Given the performance focus and active shopper behavior, are you thinking search-heavy with SEM and shopping ads, or social channels where they're researching, or automotive-specific platforms like Autotrader?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 15:
Excellent omnichannel approach. 40% search ($810K), 30% auto sites ($610K), 30% social ($610K) creates comprehensive coverage of the research journey.

Search captures high-intent moments, auto sites reach them at point of consideration, and social retargeting keeps you top-of-mind across touchpoints. The tight funnel approach maximizes your 15% test drive conversion rate.

For **Loyalty** ($900K targeting 1,200 service appointments monthly), what channels work best for your CRM-driven approach? Are you thinking email marketing, direct mail, SMS, or digital retargeting to your existing customer database?

Turn 16:
Perfect CRM-driven approach. 40% email ($360K), 30% direct mail ($270K), 30% digital retargeting/SMS ($270K) creates personalized touchpoints that feel like trusted advisor communications rather than marketing.

The multi-channel approach lets you reach customers through their preferred communication method while maintaining the personal service relationship.

Now for measurement - each segment needs different success metrics. 

**Conquest**: Brand lift studies for awareness measurement
**In-Market**: Lead tracking with conversion to test drives  
**Loyalty**: Service appointment bookings and retention actions

What attribution methodology are you planning? Are you using first-touch, last-touch, or a multi-touch attribution model to understand how these segments interact and influence each other?
