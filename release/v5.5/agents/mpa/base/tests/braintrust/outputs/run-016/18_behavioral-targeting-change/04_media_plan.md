# Media Plan Output: Behavioral Targeting Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me immediately assess your efficiency target: $800K ÷ 50,000 subscribers = $16 per subscriber. With $420 LTV, that's a 26:1 LTV/CAC ratio - extremely strong for subscription business where 3-5:1 is typical.

This efficiency is aggressive but achievable given your high LTV. Subscription nutrition typically runs $25-40 CAC, so you're targeting 35-60% better than market.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 50K subscribers - is this about hitting revenue targets, market expansion, or proving unit economics at scale?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect. Your objective is market expansion with investor validation, measured by subscriber acquisition at sub-$25 CAC efficiency. The $21M ARR target confirms strong unit economics.

Let me validate your economics: At $16 target CAC vs your $25 benchmark, you're aiming for 36% better efficiency. With $420 LTV, even at $25 you'd have 17:1 ratio - exceptional for subscription. Your $16 target creates 26:1 ratio.

Based on subscription nutrition benchmarks, $16 CAC is aggressive but achievable with tight targeting to your proven audience of serious athletes and weekend warriors. The key will be precision - broad "fitness enthusiasts" typically drives CAC toward $30-40, but focused athlete targeting can hit your range.

One critical factor: what's your average monthly subscription value? I want to ensure we're modeling the customer acquisition timeline correctly for your ARR projections.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Excellent - $35/month × 12 months = $420 LTV confirms your economics. With the $35 tier as your growth engine, your $16 target CAC creates a healthy 26:1 ratio.

50,000 subscribers × $420 = $21M ARR validates your revenue target perfectly.

Your economics are solid for aggressive growth. At $16 CAC, you're targeting premium efficiency that requires precise audience definition. The difference between "fitness enthusiasts" broadly and "serious athletes who buy premium nutrition" will determine if you hit $16 or drift toward the $25-40 market range.

Your Step 1 Outcomes are complete: Market expansion objective, subscriber acquisition KPI, 50K volume target with sub-$25 CAC efficiency benchmark.

Now let's define your target audience precisely. You mentioned serious athletes and weekend warriors - what specific behavioral or demographic signals best identify customers who convert to your $35 monthly subscription?

Turn 4:
Perfect audience definition. Let me size this precisely:

**Primary Target: Performance-Focused Endurance Athletes**
- Demographics: Age 30-45, HHI $100K+, professional careers
- Behavioral: Train for marathons/triathlons/ultras, use performance tracking apps
- Psychographic: View nutrition as performance investment, not casual supplementation

This is significantly more precise than broad "fitness enthusiasts" - exactly what you need to hit $16 CAC.

Based on endurance sports participation data, this audience represents roughly 2-3% of the broader fitness market but converts at 3-5x higher rates due to their serious commitment and disposable income.

Secondary consideration: Do you also see strong performance from "aspiring" endurance athletes - people training for their first marathon or triathlon who exhibit the same income/tracking behaviors but haven't completed major events yet? This could expand your addressable audience while maintaining conversion quality.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Excellent - that's a game-changer for audience sizing and efficiency.

**Refined Target Audience:**
- **Core Segment (75%):** Experienced endurance athletes with proven event history
- **Growth Segment (25%):** Emerging endurance athletes training for first major events

Both segments share: 30-45, $100K+ HHI, performance tracking usage, nutrition-as-investment mindset.

The emerging segment is particularly valuable - they're habit-forming, highly motivated, and less saturated by competitor messaging. This dual-segment approach significantly expands your addressable market while maintaining conversion quality.

Your audience definition is complete and well-positioned for your $16 CAC target. The precision around endurance focus plus income qualification should drive the efficiency you need.

Now for geography: You mentioned targeting across the US initially. Are there specific regions or DMAs where your current subscriber base is concentrated, or particular areas where endurance sports participation is higher?

Turn 6:
Perfect geographic insight. Your current strongholds align with classic endurance sports hubs and affluent professional markets.

**Core Markets (40% concentration):** CA/CO metros - SF, Boulder, Denver, LA
**Proven Secondary:** Austin, Seattle, Boston, NYC corridor
**Strategic Expansion Opportunity:** Similar metros with endurance culture + professional demographics

For strategic expansion, consider markets like Portland, Minneapolis, Washington DC, Atlanta, and Charlotte - all have strong endurance communities and professional populations that match your $100K+ HHI target.

With $800K budget across this geographic mix, you'll have enough concentration in core markets to maintain efficiency while testing expansion markets. The metro-focused approach is smart - endurance athletes cluster in these areas, and media costs are justified by higher conversion density.

Your geography strategy supports your $16 CAC target by focusing spend where your audience concentrates rather than broad national dispersion.

Now let's structure your budget. With $800K total and your geographic priorities, how are you thinking about allocation between your proven core markets versus expansion testing?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Excellent refinement! Marathon-specific targeting is much sharper and perfectly aligned with your product design.

**Refined Target: Active Marathon Runners in Training**
- Registered for upcoming marathons (6-month training window)
- Active on Strava/performance tracking apps
- Recent running gear purchases
- Consuming marathon training content

This precision targeting dramatically improves your $16 CAC feasibility. Marathon runners are highly motivated, invest significantly in performance, and align perfectly with your endurance nutrition positioning. The behavioral signals (race registration, gear purchases, training content) create excellent targeting precision.

Marathon participation is roughly 0.6% of US adults, but your income and engagement filters create an even more focused audience - exactly what you need for premium efficiency.

This targeting shift strengthens your entire plan. Marathon training creates a natural 16-20 week customer journey where nutrition becomes critical, giving you clear messaging hooks and seasonal planning opportunities.

Now for budget allocation: With this marathon-focused approach and your geographic concentration in endurance hubs, how do you want to split your $800K between core markets (CA/CO) versus expansion testing?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 8:
Perfect allocation strategy. Let me validate the math:

**Core Markets (CA/CO): $560K ÷ 35,000 target subscribers = $16 CAC**
**Expansion Markets (WA/MA): $240K ÷ 15,000 target subscribers = $16 CAC**

Your 70/30 split maintains your $16 efficiency target across both segments while concentrating firepower in proven markets. The expansion markets you selected (Seattle/Boston) have strong marathon cultures and professional demographics that mirror your CA/CO success.

This budget structure is smart - enough concentration in core markets to leverage existing momentum, while the expansion test is substantial enough ($240K) to generate meaningful learnings about geographic scalability.

Your marathon runner targeting should maintain efficiency across both segments since the behavioral signals (race registration, training apps, gear purchases) remain consistent regardless of geography.

Budget allocation complete. Now let's develop your value proposition. How do you currently position EnduraFuel against competitors when targeting marathon runners specifically? What makes serious marathon runners choose your subscription over one-time purchases or competitor products?
