# Media Plan Output: Audience Removal Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've provided excellent foundation data. Let me start with your business outcome: 15,000 test drives is clear, but what happens after the test drive? Are you measuring actual vehicle sales, reservations, or qualified leads that convert to sales within a specific timeframe?

Turn 2:
Perfect. Let me update our projections: $4M / 15,000 test drives = $267 per test drive, then 3,000 reservations means a 20% test drive to reservation rate.

That $267 cost per test drive is aggressive for automotive - luxury auto typically runs $400-600 per test drive based on industry benchmarks. At 20% conversion, you're essentially targeting $1,333 per reservation ($4M / 3,000), which is more realistic for EV launches.

To hit $267 per test drive, you'll need highly efficient targeting and strong creative that pre-qualifies serious buyers. The good news is your three distinct segments give us multiple optimization paths.

What's the average selling price of your EV, and do you have target profit margins per vehicle sale?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using 15% conversion as a conservative baseline from your competitive research. You can refine as you gather real data.

At 15% conversion: 15,000 test drives × 15% = 2,250 reservations vs your 3,000 target. That's a 25% gap.

To hit 3,000 reservations at 15% conversion, you'd need 20,000 test drives, pushing your cost per test drive to $200 - much more achievable and closer to premium automotive benchmarks.

This gives us two strategic paths: optimize for higher conversion rates through better qualification, or increase test drive volume. Both are viable with your strong unit economics.

Your Step 2 economics are solid - strong profit margins can absorb higher acquisition costs. Now let's define your audiences precisely. 

Starting with eco-conscious early adopters 25-45: beyond age and environmental values, what specific behaviors or characteristics define this segment? Think purchase patterns, media consumption, or lifestyle indicators.

Turn 5:
Excellent targeting signals. That's 15-20 behavioral and demographic indicators - perfect for precision targeting.

Now for luxury buyers 45-65 switching from German sedans: what specific behaviors distinguish this segment? Are we talking current BMW/Mercedes/Audi owners, or broader luxury car consideration? What drives their switch motivation beyond the German sedan reference?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Let me model this out: At $65K base with $80K average final price and 22% margin, you're looking at $17,600 gross profit per vehicle. With $14,300 target margin, that suggests some variability in your costing.

Here's the critical efficiency check: $4M budget / 3,000 reservations = $1,333 per reservation. If your sales team converts reservations to sales at typical automotive rates (60-80%), you're looking at 1,800-2,400 actual sales.

At $17,600 profit per vehicle, even 1,800 sales generates $31.7M gross profit against your $4M media investment - that's a strong 8:1 return.

Your economics look solid. The $267 per test drive target remains aggressive but achievable given the high unit value. Your biggest risk is the test drive to reservation conversion rate - 20% is optimistic for luxury automotive.

Do you have any data on test drive conversion rates from previous launches or competitor benchmarks?

Turn 6:
Perfect - that's highly targetable with vehicle ownership data and professional targeting. Strong media consumption patterns too.

For tech enthusiasts who care about features: what specific tech behaviors or interests define this group? Are we talking software developers, gadget reviewers, Tesla owners, or broader early tech adopters? What age range and what specific features drive their interest?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 7:
Excellent. You've given us three distinct, highly targetable segments with clear behavioral signals:

1. **Eco-conscious professionals (25-45)**: Urban, graduate-educated, sustainability-focused lifestyle
2. **Luxury German sedan switchers (45-65)**: Current BMW/Mercedes/Audi owners, C-suite, performance-focused  
3. **Tech enthusiasts (28-45)**: Software engineers, Tesla owners, feature-obsessed early adopters

Now for geography: You mentioned California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Washington. Within these states, are you targeting specific metro areas, or do you want statewide coverage? For example, in California are we talking LA/SF/San Diego, or broader state coverage?

Turn 8:
Smart strategic decision. Let me recalculate: Dropping one segment means you can allocate $4M across two audiences instead of three, giving each segment roughly $2M for deeper penetration and frequency.

This should improve your test drive efficiency significantly. With more concentrated spend per segment, you can:
- Achieve higher frequency against your core targets
- Test more creative variations per segment  
- Potentially hit that $200-250 per test drive range more easily

Two well-funded segments often outperform three underfunded ones.

Now, back to geography: Within California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Washington - are you targeting specific metro areas or statewide? For example, in California are we focusing on LA/SF/San Diego metros, or do you want broader state coverage?

Turn 9:
Perfect. That's 11 major metro areas - all strong EV markets with the infrastructure and demographics to support your segments.

Let me structure this for our targeting:

**CALIFORNIA**
- Los Angeles DMA
- San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose DMA  
- San Diego DMA

**TEXAS**
- Austin DMA
- Dallas-Ft. Worth DMA
- Houston DMA

**FLORIDA**
- Miami-Ft. Lauderdale DMA
- Orlando-Daytona Beach DMA
- Tampa-St. Petersburg DMA

**NEW YORK**
- New York DMA

**WASHINGTON**
- Seattle-Tacoma DMA

These 11 DMAs give us excellent coverage of affluent, tech-forward, environmentally conscious populations. Strong EV adoption rates and charging infrastructure in all markets.

Now for budget allocation: Do you want to weight spend equally across all 11 DMAs, or prioritize certain markets? For example, should California get a larger share given EV adoption rates, or do you prefer even distribution?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 10:
Excellent allocation strategy. Let me map this out:

**CALIFORNIA (40% = $1.6M)**
- San Francisco Bay Area: ~$700K (highest eco-conscious professional concentration)
- Los Angeles: ~$700K (luxury buyers + eco-conscious mix)
- San Diego: ~$200K (smaller but growing market)

**TEXAS (20% = $800K)**
- Austin: ~$350K (tech hub, highest EV adoption)
- Dallas: ~$250K (luxury buyer concentration)
- Houston: ~$200K (emerging market)

**NEW YORK (20% = $800K)**
- NYC Metro: $800K (high luxury buyer density)

**FLORIDA + WASHINGTON (20% = $800K)**
- Seattle: ~$350K (tech professionals)
- Miami: ~$200K (luxury buyers)
- Orlando: ~$125K
- Tampa: ~$125K

This gives you concentrated firepower in your strongest markets while maintaining presence in growth markets.

Now for your value proposition: How do you want to differentiate against Tesla and other luxury EVs for each segment? What's your core message to eco-conscious professionals versus luxury German sedan switchers?

Turn 11:
Strong differentiation strategy. You're speaking to each segment's core motivations - holistic sustainability versus technological superiority.

**ECO-CONSCIOUS POSITIONING**: "Beyond Zero Emissions" - holistic impact story
**LUXURY SWITCHER POSITIONING**: "Beyond Performance" - technological leap narrative

This gives us clear creative direction and channel strategy foundations.

Now let's move to channels. With $4M across two distinct segments and 11 DMAs, we need channels that can deliver both reach and precision targeting.

For your eco-conscious professionals (podcast listeners, Strava users, urban sustainability-focused), what channels do you think would be most effective? And for luxury German sedan switchers (WSJ readers, CNBC viewers, LinkedIn users), where should we focus our efforts?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 12:
Excellent channel thinking. You're matching media consumption patterns perfectly to each segment.

Let me structure your channel strategy:

**ECO-CONSCIOUS PROFESSIONALS ($2M)**
- Podcast advertising (sustainability/tech shows): ~40%
- LinkedIn + targeted display (Fast Company, Wired): ~35% 
- Event sponsorships (climate/tech conferences): ~15%
- Video content/social: ~10%

**LUXURY SEDAN SWITCHERS ($2M)**
- Premium digital (WSJ, Bloomberg, CNBC): ~40%
- LinkedIn sponsored content: ~25%
- OOH in financial districts: ~20%
- Performance-focused video content: ~15%

This gives you segment-specific reach with clear attribution paths.

For measurement: Beyond test drives and reservations, what other metrics matter? Are you tracking brand awareness, consideration, or specific engagement metrics that help optimize during the campaign?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 13:
Perfect measurement framework. You're balancing performance with brand building - critical for a new EV launch.

**PRIMARY METRICS**
- Test drives: 15,000 target
- Reservations: 3,000 target (20% conversion goal, 15% conservative)

**SECONDARY METRICS**
- Brand consideration lift (pre/post campaign)
- Perception shifts: technological innovation + sustainability credentials
- Channel engagement: video completion, LinkedIn interactions, podcast completion rates

This gives you both immediate performance data and longer-term brand equity measurement.

Now for testing: With two distinct segments and multiple channels, what specific tests would be most valuable? Are you thinking creative variations, audience refinements, or channel performance comparisons?
