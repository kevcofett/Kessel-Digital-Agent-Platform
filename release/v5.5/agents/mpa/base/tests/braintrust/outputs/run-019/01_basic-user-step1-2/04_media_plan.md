# Media Plan Output: Basic User - Steps 1-2 Completion

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with more shoe sales?

Turn 2:
Got it! Growing sales and brand awareness are both important. To build the right plan, I need to understand how you'll measure success.

What would success look like as a number - are you targeting a specific number of new customers, or a dollar amount in sales?

Turn 3:
Perfect! $250,000 to reach 5,000 customers means you can spend $50 per customer. Let me check if that's realistic for shoe retail.

Based on industry benchmarks, online shoe brands typically spend $50-80 per customer. Your $50 target is on the efficient end - achievable but will require focused targeting.

Now for the economics: what do you make in profit when someone buys a pair of shoes? This helps us confirm your $50 per customer budget will be profitable.

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 5:
Excellent! Active professionals who value style and comfort is a strong, focused audience. That versatility angle - work to social - is a great positioning for targeting.

To sharpen this further: are you thinking more men, women, or both? And any particular income level or lifestyle signals that would help us find these style-conscious professionals?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 4:
That's helpful! At $50-60 profit per pair, spending $50 to get a customer gives you a solid return - you'll make your money back immediately and build a customer base for future sales.

Your economics look strong. At $50 profit and $50 cost per customer, you break even on the first purchase, which is actually quite good for a newer brand building awareness.

This confirms your $250,000 budget for 5,000 customers is realistic. Now let's define who those customers should be.

Who is your ideal customer for these shoes - what type of person are you trying to reach?
