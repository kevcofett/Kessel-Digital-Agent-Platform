# Media Plan Output: Volume Target Increase

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business outcome. You mentioned acquiring 5,000 new customers - is customer acquisition your primary objective, or are you also focused on revenue targets or other business goals alongside this?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your primary objective is customer acquisition with 5,000 new customers as the main KPI, plus $1.6M revenue as a secondary target. 

Let me check the math: $1.6M ÷ 5,000 customers = $320 average order value, which matches your LTV nicely. And $400K ÷ 5,000 = $80 per customer acquisition cost.

At $80 CAC against $320 LTV, you're targeting a 4:1 ratio - that's solid for sustainable growth. For home goods e-commerce, $80 CAC is realistic, typically running $60-100 depending on product mix and targeting precision.

Your efficiency target looks achievable. Now let's make sure the unit economics work for profitability. What's your gross margin on that $320 average order value?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Let me update the economics. At 42% margin on $320 AOV = $134 gross profit per customer. With your $80 target CAC, that leaves $54 contribution margin per customer ($134 - $80). That's a healthy 17% net margin after acquisition costs.

Your $80 CAC target is well-positioned - it's 60% of your gross profit, leaving solid room for profitability. This efficiency is definitely achievable for home goods.

$400K budget targeting 5,000 customers at $80 each works mathematically and should deliver your $1.6M revenue goal while maintaining strong unit economics.

Now let's define your target audience. Who is your ideal customer for home goods? What demographics, behaviors, or characteristics define your best buyers?

Turn 4:
Great profile. Homeowners 30-55 with disposable income, focused on home refresh projects - that's a solid foundation. The "curated but not overly expensive" positioning helps define the sweet spot between discount and luxury.

Let me dig deeper on a few key targeting signals. When you say "some disposable income," what household income range typically converts best for your products? And do you see stronger performance from recent movers, new homeowners, or people in established homes doing refresh projects?

Also, are there specific life stage indicators that signal higher purchase intent - like new marriages, growing families, or empty nesters?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Perfect targeting foundation. $75K-$150K HHI with recent movers, new homeowners, newlyweds, and growing families - those are high-intent signals for home goods.

Let me model your audience size. For homeowners 30-55 in that income bracket, you're looking at roughly 15-20% of US adults. Adding the life stage filters (recent moves, new marriages, growing families) typically narrows this to about 3-5% of the total population, or roughly 8-13 million people nationally.

That gives you a substantial addressable audience - much larger than your 5,000 target, which is good for efficient reach.

Now for geography: Are you planning a national campaign, or do you want to focus on specific regions or metro areas where your products perform better?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
National campaign targeting major urban/suburban markets makes sense for brand building and maximizing your addressable audience. The Northeast, West Coast, and Sun Belt regions align well with your $75K-$150K income targets and homeowner demographics.

With 8-13 million people in your target audience nationally, you have plenty of reach potential for 5,000 customers without oversaturating any single market.

Now let's finalize your budget allocation. You have $400K total. How much of that do you want to allocate to media spend versus keeping in reserve for creative production, testing, or optimization adjustments? 

Also, are you planning to spread this evenly across Q1-Q2, or do you have timing preferences for when to be more aggressive?

Turn 7:
Smart allocation. $360K media spend with $40K reserve gives you 10% flexibility - that's right in line with best practices. Your 60/40 split ($216K Q1, $144K Q2) aligns well with spring home refresh seasonality.

Let me check the pacing math: Q1 at $216K targets 2,700 customers ($80 CAC). Q2 at $144K targets 1,800 customers. That gets you to 4,500 total - 500 customers short of your 5,000 goal.

You have three options: increase Q2 budget to $184K to hit exactly 5,000, accept 4,500 customers and beat your $80 CAC target, or use some reserve budget if Q1 performance justifies it.

Which approach feels right, or should we adjust the quarterly split?

Turn 8:
Let me update our projections. $360K ÷ 8,000 = $45 per customer. That's 44% more efficient than your original $80 target - a significant jump.

For home goods, $45 CAC is aggressive. Market typically runs $60-100, so you'd be targeting 25-55% below benchmark efficiency. At your $134 gross profit, this would leave $89 contribution margin per customer - excellent unit economics IF achievable.

To hit $45 CAC, you'd need extremely tight audience targeting and high-performing channels. This is ambitious but possible with the right execution.

Your alternatives: increase budget to $640K to maintain realistic $80 CAC, or accept the efficiency challenge and build a plan optimized for maximum performance.

Which direction makes more sense - pushing for higher budget or building the most efficient plan possible with current budget?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
I appreciate your strategic thinking on proving efficiency first. However, we're still in Step 5 (Budget) and need to complete your value proposition before we dive into specific channels like Meta, Pinterest, and Google Shopping. The right channels depend on how you position your brand message.

At $45 CAC, your messaging needs to be razor-sharp to drive immediate action. What's your core value proposition? Are you positioned as affordable style, premium quality at fair prices, unique/hard-to-find pieces, or something else?

Your value prop will determine which channels can actually deliver that aggressive $45 efficiency. Let's nail this positioning first, then we'll build the perfect channel mix in Step 7.

Turn 10:
Perfect positioning - "curated style at accessible prices" hits your target audience's sweet spot. Professionals and young families want that intentional, high-quality look without the premium price tag. The "looks more expensive than it is" angle is compelling for your $75K-$150K income segment.

This value proposition supports your aggressive $45 CAC target because it speaks directly to a specific need: achieving designer looks affordably. That clear benefit can drive immediate action when messaged correctly.

Your messaging framework is solid for efficient conversion. Now let's build your channel strategy to deliver that $45 efficiency.

Given your $360K budget, aggressive efficiency target, and "curated style at accessible prices" positioning, which channels are you most interested in exploring? We'll need a mix that captures both high-intent shoppers and builds awareness efficiently.
