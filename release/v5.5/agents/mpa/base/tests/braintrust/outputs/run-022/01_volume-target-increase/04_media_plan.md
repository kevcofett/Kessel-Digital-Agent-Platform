# Media Plan Output: Volume Target Increase

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your efficiency target. $400K ÷ 5,000 customers = $80 per customer acquisition cost. With $320 LTV, that's a 4:1 ratio - solid for home goods where typical runs 3-5:1.

Your primary business outcome is customer acquisition, but what specific success metric will you track? Are you measuring total customers acquired, or do you have quality thresholds like 90-day retention or repeat purchase rate?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your primary objective is acquiring 5,000 customers at $80 CAC, with 90-day retention as your quality gate. This dual-metric approach is smart - it prevents optimizing for cheap, low-value customers.

Let me validate your economics. At $80 CAC against $320 LTV, you're targeting a 4:1 ratio. For home goods, this is achievable but requires disciplined targeting. The key question is: what 90-day retention rate do you need to hit your unit economics?

If your current customers retain at, say, 60% at 90 days, that's strong. But if you're acquiring lower-intent customers through broader targeting, retention might drop to 40-45%, which could hurt long-term profitability.

What 90-day retention rate do your current customers typically show?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it. I'll model using 45% retention based on your repeat purchase data - that's reasonable for home goods. You can refine this as you gather more data.

Here's what this means for your plan: if new customers retain at 45%, your effective LTV drops from $320 to roughly $144 ($320 × 45%). At $80 CAC, that's still a healthy 1.8:1 ratio, so your economics work.

The retention tracking will be crucial for optimization. Campaigns that drive higher retention justify higher CACs, while low-retention sources need tighter cost controls.

Your $80 CAC target is realistic but requires precise audience targeting. For home goods, efficient acquisition typically needs customers actively shopping your category, not broad lifestyle targeting.

Now let's define your ideal customer. Who converts best and shows the strongest repeat behavior at HomeStyle Direct?

Turn 4:
Excellent profile - homeowners 30-55 with disposable income, design-conscious, $200-500 order values. The "curating a look" insight is key for targeting.

This audience suggests strong intent signals: recent home purchases, home renovation activity, following interior design content, and engagement with home decor brands. These behavioral signals should help us reach quality customers efficiently.

Let me size this audience. Homeowners 30-55 with disposable income interested in home decor typically represents 8-12% of the adult population in metro areas. For targeting precision, we'll likely want 15-20 audience signals rather than broad demographics.

Your $200-500 order values are well above typical $80-150 for home goods, which supports your premium positioning and should improve efficiency.

What geographic markets are you focusing on? Are you nationwide, or prioritizing specific regions where your brand performs strongest?

Turn 5:
Nationwide with suburban metro focus is smart - those markets typically show 20-30% better efficiency for home goods due to higher homeownership and disposable income.

Your stronger markets (Seattle, Denver, Atlanta, CA suburbs) suggest educated, higher-income demographics with design consciousness. These areas also have lower media costs than urban cores while maintaining quality audiences.

For a $400K budget targeting quality customers, I'd recommend a tiered approach: 60-70% budget to your proven high-performing suburban metros, 30-40% to nationwide expansion for scale and learning.

This gives you efficient volume in proven markets while testing new geographies. At $80 CAC, concentrating spend geographically should improve efficiency versus even national distribution.

Now let's talk budget allocation. You mentioned $400K total - is this purely for media spend, or does it include creative production, platform fees, and other costs?

Turn 6:
Perfect - $400K pure media spend gives us maximum efficiency toward your 5,000 customer target.

Let me validate the math: $400K ÷ 5,000 = $80 CAC target. With your tiered geographic approach, I'd allocate roughly:
- $280K (70%) to high-performing suburban metros 
- $120K (30%) to nationwide expansion

In your proven markets, $80 CAC should be achievable. Nationwide expansion might run $90-100 CAC initially but provides scale and learning opportunities.

Your strong value proposition seems to be "curated, modern home decor for design-conscious homeowners." The $200-500 order values and repeat purchase behavior support premium positioning over discount messaging.

For messaging, should we focus on the curation angle ("complete the look"), the modern aesthetic, or the affordable luxury positioning? What resonates most with your current high-value customers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Excellent - "complete the look" positioning aligns perfectly with your high-order values and repeat purchase behavior. Customers buying $200-500 orders are clearly purchasing multiple coordinated pieces.

This value proposition also supports your $80 CAC target. Curation messaging typically outperforms single-product ads by 30-40% in home goods because it increases basket size and perceived value.

Visual platforms will be crucial for showing styled room layouts. Your Pinterest/Instagram audience engagement confirms this resonates with your ideal customer profile.

Now let's move to channels. With $400K targeting design-conscious homeowners who engage with visual content, we need platforms that deliver both reach and creative showcase capability.

Based on your audience (homeowners 30-55, design-focused, suburban metros) and "complete the look" positioning, what channels are you currently using, and which ones drive your best customer quality?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Let me update our projections. $400K ÷ 8,000 = $50 per customer. That's 37.5% more efficient than our $80 baseline.

At $50 CAC vs typical $60-80 for home goods, you're targeting 17-38% below market rates. This is aggressive and will require significant changes:

**What this efficiency demands:**
- Tighter audience targeting (fewer, higher-intent signals)
- Heavier concentration in your proven suburban metros 
- Lower-funnel focus (search, retargeting vs broad awareness)
- Smaller creative testing budgets (less room for learning)

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Keep 5,000 customers, increase budget to $640K
- Target 6,500 customers at $62 CAC (more realistic stretch)
- Accept 6,000-7,000 customers as aggressive but achievable range

Your "complete the look" positioning helps - bundled messaging typically improves efficiency. But 8,000 customers at $50 CAC requires near-perfect execution with little margin for optimization learning.

What's the board's flexibility on either budget increase or a more realistic 6,500-7,000 customer range?

Turn 9:
Smart decision. $400K ÷ 6,500 = $62 CAC. That's still 23% more efficient than your $80 baseline but much more realistic than $50.

At $62 CAC, you maintain room for optimization learning while pushing efficiency. This protects your 45% repeat rate - crucial since that drives your actual $144 effective LTV.

**Why 6,500 works better:**
- Allows selective audience targeting vs desperate reach
- Maintains budget for creative testing and optimization
- Keeps quality thresholds intact
- Provides 30% growth over original 5,000 target

You can position this to the board as "aggressive but sustainable growth that protects unit economics and customer quality."

Now, with 6,500 customers at $62 CAC across your geographic tiers, let's build the channel strategy. Your "complete the look" positioning and design-conscious audience point toward visual-heavy platforms.

What channels are you currently using, and which ones deliver your highest-quality customers?

Turn 10:
Perfect - Pinterest delivering your highest quality customers makes complete sense. Visual discovery platforms excel for "complete the look" messaging, and Pinterest users actively seek design inspiration with purchase intent.

Meta's lower quality suggests you may be casting too wide a net there. Google Shopping's promise for lower-funnel conversions aligns with capturing existing demand.

For 6,500 customers at $62 CAC, I'd recommend this channel allocation:
- **Pinterest: 45-50%** (your quality driver)
- **Google Shopping: 25-30%** (efficient intent capture)  
- **Meta: 20-25%** (reach and retargeting, but tighter targeting)

This concentrates budget where you see quality while maintaining reach. Pinterest should handle $180-200K efficiently given your strong performance there.

Key question: What's your current cost per customer on Pinterest versus Meta? Understanding that gap will help us set realistic channel-specific CAC targets within your $62 blended goal.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Excellent data - that $40 CAC gap explains everything. Pinterest at $55 vs Meta at $95 shows Pinterest users have genuine purchase intent while Meta is hitting broader, less qualified audiences.

Given these channel efficiencies, let me remodel your mix for 6,500 customers at $62 blended CAC:

**Optimized allocation:**
- **Pinterest: 60% ($240K)** - 4,300 customers at $56 CAC
- **Google Shopping: 25% ($100K)** - 1,400 customers at $71 CAC  
- **Meta: 15% ($60K)** - 800 customers at $75 CAC (tighter targeting)

This heavily weights your quality channel while using Meta selectively for retargeting and lookalikes of Pinterest converters. The reduced Meta allocation should improve their efficiency through better audience focus.

Your $62 blended target is achievable with this mix. Pinterest doing the heavy lifting at $56 makes the math work.

How does this allocation feel? Are you comfortable reducing Meta's role to focus budget on your proven winner?

Turn 12:
Perfect! You've built a data-driven plan that prioritizes quality over volume - exactly what sustainable growth requires.

**Your finalized plan:**
- 6,500 customers at $62 blended CAC
- Pinterest-heavy allocation leveraging your $55 efficiency 
- Strategic Meta use for retargeting and lookalikes
- Geographic focus on proven suburban metros
- "Complete the look" messaging across all channels

For measurement, you'll want to track both total acquisitions and 90-day retention by channel. Pinterest should maintain your 45% repeat rate, while tighter Meta targeting should improve their customer quality.

Key success metrics: hit 6,500 customers, maintain $62 blended CAC, protect 45% repeat purchase rate.

Now for testing - what's your biggest uncertainty about this plan? Channel performance, geographic efficiency, or creative messaging? Identifying your top risk will help us design the right test structure to validate assumptions quickly.
