# Media Plan Output: Volume Target Increase

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business outcome. You mentioned acquiring 5,000 new customers - is customer acquisition your primary objective, or are you also focused on revenue targets or brand awareness alongside acquisition?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So customer acquisition is your primary objective with revenue generation as the underlying business goal. 

For measuring success, it sounds like your primary KPI would be new customers acquired - that 5,000 target. Is that correct, or do you also want to track a specific revenue target from those new customers?

With your $320 LTV, those 5,000 customers could potentially generate $1.6M in lifetime value, but I want to confirm how you'll define success for this campaign.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent. So your primary KPI is 5,000 new customers with a secondary target of $1.2M in lifetime revenue. That implies an average LTV of $240 per customer for this cohort ($1.2M ÷ 5,000), which is a bit more conservative than your current $320 average.

Now let's check if your efficiency target is realistic. With a $400K budget targeting 5,000 customers, that's $80 per customer acquisition cost. 

For home goods e-commerce, typical acquisition costs run $60-100 based on industry benchmarks. Your $80 target sits right in the middle - achievable but will require solid targeting and channel efficiency.

Does that $80 cost per customer align with your unit economics? What's your typical profit margin on first purchases?

Turn 4:
Got it. With 42% margins, your first-purchase profitability depends on average order value. If your AOV is around $190 or higher ($190 × 42% = $80), you'd break even on first purchase. Below that, you're investing for future LTV.

At $80 CAC with $240 target LTV, you're looking at a 3:1 LTV-to-CAC ratio, which is solid for sustainable growth. This confirms your target is challenging but realistic with tight execution.

Your economics foundation looks sound. Now let's move to Step 3 - defining your target audience. 

Who is your ideal customer for home goods? Are you targeting homeowners, renters, specific age groups, or particular life stages like new homeowners or people redecorating?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Perfect. Homeowners 30-55 with disposable income focused on home décor upgrades - that's a strong foundation. 

Let me dig deeper into the behavioral signals. Beyond homeownership and age, what specific behaviors or interests best identify your ideal customers? For example:

- Recent home purchase or renovation activity
- Engagement with interior design content
- Shopping behavior (premium vs. budget-focused)
- Lifestyle interests (entertaining, family-focused, etc.)

What signals have you found most predictive of customers who actually purchase and stick around?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent insights. So your core audience is design-conscious professionals actively improving their homes, with preference for mid-century modern and minimalist aesthetics. They prioritize quality over price and engage with design content online.

This gives us strong targeting signals: interior design content engagement, Pinterest activity around those styles, recent home purchase/renovation indicators, and professional demographics.

Now for geography - are you targeting nationally, or do you have specific regions or markets that perform better? Any geographic constraints on shipping or particular areas where your brand resonates more strongly?

Turn 7:
Great - nationwide with stronger performance in high-income urban/suburban markets like Northeast and West Coast metros. Those areas align perfectly with your professional, design-conscious audience profile.

Now let's move to Step 5 - budget allocation. With your $400K total budget, how are you thinking about dividing it? 

Are you planning to allocate based on geography (more to those stronger Northeast/West Coast markets), or do you want to split between customer acquisition and other goals like retention or brand building?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Let me update our projections. $400K ÷ 8,000 = $50 per customer. That's 37.5% more efficient than our $80 baseline.

For home goods, $50 CAC is aggressive - typical runs $60-100. At your 42% margins, you'd need $119+ average order value just to break even on first purchase ($50 ÷ 42%).

To hit 8,000 customers, you have three options:
1. Increase budget to ~$640K (8,000 × $80)
2. Accept the aggressive $50 target with very tight audience targeting
3. Compromise at ~6,500 customers with current budget

The $50 target is achievable but requires exceptional execution - laser-focused creative, precise audience definition, and optimal channel mix. 

What's your current average order value? That will help determine if the math works.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
With $180 AOV and 42% margins, you're making $76 per first purchase ($180 × 42%). At $50 CAC, that's $26 profit per customer on first purchase - workable but thin.

Given board pressure for aggressive growth, I'd recommend a hybrid approach:

**Option 1 (Recommended):** Target 6,500 customers at $62 CAC
- More realistic efficiency target
- Still 30% growth over original plan
- $18 profit margin per first purchase
- Requires good execution, not perfect execution

**Option 2:** Pursue 8,000 with staged approach
- Start with $400K targeting 6,500 customers
- If hitting efficiency targets by month 2, request additional $200K
- Proves viability before full commitment

The 8,000 target at $50 CAC requires everything to go right - perfect audience targeting, optimal creative, and ideal channel mix. One underperforming channel could derail the entire plan.

Which approach feels more realistic for your team's execution capability?

Turn 10:
Perfect decision. 6,500 customers at $62 CAC gives you ambitious but achievable growth with built-in margin for optimization. You can always scale up if performance exceeds expectations.

Now let's define your value proposition. With design-conscious professionals willing to pay for quality, what specifically differentiates HomeStyle Direct from other home goods retailers?

Is it your product curation, design aesthetic, quality standards, customer experience, or something else that makes customers choose you over competitors like Wayfair or West Elm?
