USER:
Hey, I'm the growth lead at QuickSend. We're a remittance fintech looking to acquire 10,000 new users this quarter with a $500K media spend. Let's build out the media strategy.

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by recalculating your efficiency target: $500K ÷ 10,000 users = $50 per user acquisition. For fintech, that's aggressive - typical remittance CAC runs $75-120 based on industry benchmarks.

You mentioned acquiring users, but what's the core business outcome you're driving? Are you focused on transaction volume, revenue growth, or expanding into new markets?

TURN 2 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're primarily focused on transaction volume right now. Our leadership wants to increase total money transferred through our platform, which we believe will drive revenue growth. The $50 CAC target is ambitious, but we're betting on our product's ease of use to help drive efficient acquisition. We know we need to be competitive in the remittance space, so we're looking to expand our market share, especially with immigrant communities who need reliable, low-cost transfer options.

AGENT:
Perfect. Transaction volume growth through market share expansion is your objective. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success as a number.

For remittance, you could track total transaction volume (dollars transferred), number of transactions, or revenue generated. Which specific metric will leadership use to determine if this campaign succeeded?

And what's your target - for example, $X million in transaction volume or Y number of transactions from these 10,000 new users?

TURN 3 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're targeting around $25 million in total transaction volume from these new users. Our leadership wants to see an average transaction size of about $500, which would mean roughly 50,000 transactions from the 10,000 new users we're acquiring. Right now, we don't have super precise metrics, but that's the benchmark we're working toward.

AGENT:
Excellent. Let me model your economics to assess if your $50 CAC target is achievable.

At 2.5% transaction fee (typical remittance rate): $25M × 2.5% = $625K revenue from these users. With $500K acquisition cost, that's $125K net contribution - solid unit economics if users transact immediately.

However, your efficiency target is challenging. $50 CAC is 33-58% below typical remittance benchmarks ($75-120). To hit this, you'll need exceptional targeting precision.

Do these new users typically transact in their first month, or is there a ramp period? And what's your average customer lifetime - do they continue transacting regularly after initial use?
