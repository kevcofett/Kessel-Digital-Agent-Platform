# Media Plan Output: Basic User - Steps 1-2 Completion

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What business outcome are you trying to achieve? Are you looking to get more customers, increase sales from existing customers, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Growing your customer base through new customer acquisition is a clear objective.

Now I need to understand how you'll measure success. What number would tell you this campaign worked? For example, are you targeting a specific number of new customers, or a sales revenue amount?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it! Let me work with $500,000 in additional sales as your target - that gives us something concrete to plan around.

To build a realistic plan, I need to understand what a typical customer is worth to you. What's your average order value when someone buys shoes from your store?

Turn 4:
No problem! I'll model using $100 average order value - you can adjust that anytime. 

So $500,000 ÷ $100 = 5,000 new customers needed.

Now, what budget are you working with to acquire these 5,000 customers?

Turn 5:
Let me run the numbers. $250,000 budget ÷ 5,000 customers = $50 per customer to acquire.

That's quite aggressive for shoe retail - the market typically shows $60-100 per customer based on industry benchmarks. At $50, you're targeting about 17% better efficiency than typical. 

This is ambitious but achievable with tight targeting and strong execution. To hit this target, we'll need precise audience definition and efficient channel selection.

Does $50 per customer feel realistic based on what you've seen, or should we adjust either the budget or customer target?

Turn 6:
Perfect! I like your ambition. To hit $50 per customer when typical is $60-100, we need to be smart about who we target.

Let's define your ideal customer. When you think about your best shoe customers - the ones who buy and love your products - how would you describe them? Are they mostly men or women, what age range, and what are they like?
