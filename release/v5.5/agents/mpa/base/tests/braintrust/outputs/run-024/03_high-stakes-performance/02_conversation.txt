TURN 1 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Hi, I'm the VP of Growth at PayStream Financial. We're a fintech payments platform. I need to build a media plan for next year. We have a $2M budget and need to acquire 50,000 new merchants. Our merchant LTV is about $850. Can you help me structure this?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect - you've given me strong economics data upfront. Let me validate the efficiency target: $2M ÷ 50,000 = $40 CAC. With $850 LTV, that's a 21x return - excellent unit economics.

For fintech merchant acquisition, $40 CAC is aggressive. Typical runs $60-120 based on industry benchmarks. To hit $40, we'll need precise targeting.

What specific business outcome drives this 50,000 merchant target? Revenue growth, market expansion, or investor milestones?

TURN 2 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're targeting 50,000 merchants primarily for revenue growth and market expansion. Our board wants us to hit $42M in new ARR, and each merchant averages about $840 in annual transaction revenue. So this isn't just a vanity metric - it's tied directly to our growth targets. We need to be surgical in our acquisition strategy to hit that $40 CAC.

AGENT:
Excellent - the math aligns perfectly. 50,000 merchants × $840 ARR = $42M, hitting your board target.

Your $40 CAC against $850 LTV creates strong unit economics, but you're right about needing surgical precision. At 33% below typical fintech CAC, we'll need tight audience definition and channel efficiency.

For measuring success, what's your primary KPI? New merchant sign-ups, or do you track a different conversion point like qualified applications or activated accounts?

TURN 3 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're primarily tracking qualified merchant applications as our key conversion metric. We want merchants who not only sign up but actually start processing transactions. Our sales team can then nurture those MQLs into activated accounts. Getting high-intent small business owners who match our ideal customer profile is critical - we can't waste media spend on tire-kickers.

AGENT:
Perfect - qualified merchant applications as your primary KPI ensures we're driving quality over quantity. That conversion focus supports hitting your aggressive $40 CAC.

Since your sales team handles nurturing, what's your typical conversion rate from qualified application to activated merchant? This helps us model the full funnel and ensure 50,000 qualified apps actually delivers your 50,000 activated merchants target.

TURN 4 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I'll be honest - we're still refining our conversion tracking. I'd estimate around 40-50% of qualified applications convert to activated merchants, but that's more of an educated guess than a hard number. We know we need to tighten that funnel and improve our conversion efficiency. Would love your perspective on how we can optimize that sales handoff process.

AGENT:
Got it. I'll model using 45% conversion rate based on your range. That means we need ~111,000 qualified applications to deliver 50,000 activated merchants. This changes our efficiency target: $2M ÷ 111,000 = $18 per qualified application.

At $18 per MQL, you're in excellent territory for B2B fintech. We can refine this anytime as your conversion data improves.

Your Step 1 economics are solid. Now let's define your ideal merchant profile. What business characteristics define your best-converting merchants - industry type, revenue size, transaction volume, or other signals?

TURN 5 (Step 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're laser-focused on small businesses processing $10K-$100K monthly in transactions. Retail, professional services, and e-commerce are our sweet spots. We see the highest conversion rates with businesses that are digitally savvy, have been operating 2-3 years, and are looking to professionalize their payment infrastructure. Basically, businesses that are scaling but aren't yet enterprise-level.

AGENT:
Perfect audience definition. Digitally-savvy SMBs with $10K-$100K monthly volume in retail, professional services, and e-commerce - that's a targetable profile.

The 2-3 year operating window is smart - past startup survival but pre-enterprise solutions. "Looking to professionalize payment infrastructure" suggests pain point messaging around growth bottlenecks.

Are there specific business behaviors or digital signals that indicate this professionalization mindset? For example, businesses already using multiple software tools, seeking business loans, or showing other growth indicators?

TURN 6 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Our best signals are actually businesses using QuickBooks or Xero for accounting, those with Shopify or WooCommerce stores, and companies that have recently registered business credit lines. We've found these digital footprints strongly correlate with our ideal merchant profile - they're investing in infrastructure but aren't yet locked into enterprise payment solutions. LinkedIn's B2B targeting and Google's in-market audiences have been helpful for finding these segments, but we know we're not fully optimized yet.

AGENT:
Excellent behavioral signals - QuickBooks/Xero users and Shopify/WooCommerce merchants show clear intent to professionalize. Recent business credit registrations are brilliant timing indicators.

Your current LinkedIn B2B and Google in-market approach makes sense for reaching these segments. At your aggressive $18 per qualified application target, precise audience layering will be critical.

What geographic markets are you prioritizing? Are you focusing nationally, specific regions, or particular metro areas where your payment infrastructure performs best?

TURN 7 (Step 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're currently strongest in major metros like San Francisco, New York, Chicago, and Atlanta. But we're also looking to expand into secondary markets like Austin, Denver, and Phoenix - places with high small business formation rates. Our core strategy is national coverage, but with more concentrated spend in those core and expansion markets where we see higher merchant density and digital sophistication.

AGENT:
Smart geographic strategy. Core metros for scale, secondary markets for growth - those expansion cities have strong SMB ecosystems and digital adoption.

National coverage with concentrated spend in high-opportunity DMAs maximizes efficiency. At your $18 per qualified app target, metro concentration should deliver better performance than broad national dispersion.

Now let's validate your $2M budget allocation. You mentioned this is for next year - is this allocated quarterly, or do you have flexibility to weight spending toward high-performance periods or market opportunities?
