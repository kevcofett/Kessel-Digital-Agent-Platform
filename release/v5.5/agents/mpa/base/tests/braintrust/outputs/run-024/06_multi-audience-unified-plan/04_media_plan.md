# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience Unified Media Plan

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've given me great segment detail - we'll use that when we reach audience definition in Step 3. First, let's establish the foundation.

With 25,000 enrollees as your volume target, what's the primary business outcome you're driving? Are you focused on market share growth, revenue targets, or something else that defines success for TrueHealth?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect. Market share growth through strategic segment expansion gives us clear direction. 

Now I need to understand how you'll measure success. What's your primary KPI - is it the 25,000 total enrollees, or do you have specific enrollment targets for each segment? And what's the typical annual value of a health insurance customer to help us model the economics?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Got it. Let me model this: $3M budget / 25,000 enrollees = $120 per customer acquisition cost. With $4,800 annual premiums, that's a 40:1 return in year one alone - very strong economics for insurance.

Health insurance CAC typically runs $150-300, so your $120 target is aggressive but achievable with tight targeting. The key will be reaching the right people efficiently.

I'll model using reasonable assumptions for segment allocation and we can refine anytime. Your 10K/10K/5K split makes strategic sense given market opportunities.

Step 1 complete. Now for economics - do you have a sense of your profit margin per enrollee, or should I model using typical health insurance benchmarks of 3-5% net margin?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 4:
Perfect. I'll model at 4.5% net margin. With $4,800 annual premiums, that's about $216 profit per customer in year one.

Your $120 CAC against $216 first-year profit gives you a 1.8:1 payback ratio - healthy for insurance acquisition. Most health insurers target 2-3 year payback, so you're well positioned.

At your target efficiency, the $3M budget should generate $120M in first-year premium revenue with $5.4M profit. Strong foundation for market share growth.

Step 2 complete - your economics are realistic and sustainable.

Now let's refine those audience segments. You mentioned three distinct groups. Starting with Young Professionals - beyond ages 26-35 in urban metros, what other behavioral or demographic signals help identify this audience?

Turn 5:
Excellent detail. That's a sophisticated audience profile - high digital engagement, specific income band, and clear behavioral signals around wellness and convenience.

For the Families segment (ages 35-50, suburban), what behavioral and demographic signals beyond having kids under 18 help identify them? Are there income ranges, decision-making patterns, or other characteristics that define this group for TrueHealth?

Turn 6:
Strong profile - cost-conscious homeowners with collaborative decision-making and focus on comprehensive family coverage.

Now for Pre-Medicare (ages 55-64, heavy in FL, AZ, TX) - beyond approaching retirement, what income levels, health concerns, or decision factors characterize this segment for TrueHealth?

Turn 7:
Perfect. Three well-defined segments with distinct profiles and needs.

Now for geography - you mentioned urban metros for Young Professionals, suburban markets around top 50 metros for Families, and FL/AZ/TX concentration for Pre-Medicare. 

Should we prioritize specific DMAs within these regions, or are there particular markets where TrueHealth has existing strength or regulatory advantages we should leverage?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Excellent. Concentrating on proven markets - Austin/Dallas for Young Professionals, Phoenix/Tampa for Pre-Medicare, and Chicago/Atlanta/Denver suburbs for Families - gives us efficiency advantages and regulatory familiarity.

Step 4 complete. Now for budget allocation across your three segments.

With $3M total and your 10K/10K/5K enrollment targets, the math suggests $1.2M each for Young Professionals and Families, $600K for Pre-Medicare. Does that allocation align with your strategic priorities, or should we adjust based on market opportunity or acquisition difficulty?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Smart thinking. You're right that acquisition costs will vary - Young Professionals' digital-first behavior should drive efficiency, while Pre-Medicare's research-intensive approach may require higher touch channels.

The $1.2M/$1.2M/$600K split gives us $120 blended CAC, but we should expect Young Professionals around $80-100, Families $120-140, and Pre-Medicare $140-180 based on channel requirements and decision complexity.

Step 5 complete. Now let's define value propositions for each segment.

Starting with Young Professionals - given their focus on convenience, transparency, and digital experience, what key message should differentiate TrueHealth from competitors in Austin and Dallas markets?
