# Media Plan Output: Full 10-Step Media Planning

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your efficiency target. $750K ÷ 15,000 customers = $50 per customer. For home decor/furniture, typical acquisition costs run $60-100, so you're targeting 17-50% better efficiency than market average. This is aggressive but achievable with tight execution.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 15,000 new customers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your objective is sustainable customer base growth with focus on high-value, repeat buyers. That's smart - quality over pure volume.

For your primary success metric, you mentioned acquiring 15,000 customers. But since you're focused on higher-value buyers who repeat purchase, what's more important to track: total customer count, or something like customer lifetime value or repeat purchase rate?

This matters because optimizing for $50 acquisition cost might pull in different customers than optimizing for long-term value.

Turn 3:
Got it. I'll model using industry benchmarks for home decor LTV since you're building that data. Home decor customers typically generate $150-250 lifetime value with 30-40% making repeat purchases within 12 months. Let me use $200 LTV as our baseline - you can refine anytime.

With your $50 acquisition target against $200 LTV, that's a 4:1 ratio - very healthy for sustainable growth focused on repeat buyers.

Now for feasibility: your $50 target is aggressive for home decor (market runs $60-100), but the LTV focus actually helps. Optimizing for higher-value customers often improves efficiency since they engage more with quality messaging.

What's your average order value currently? This helps determine if we need customers spending $100+ initially or if smaller first purchases leading to repeat business works for your model.

Turn 4:
Excellent. $85-95 AOV with graduation to larger purchases is perfect for your LTV strategy. That progression from accessories to furniture is exactly how successful home decor brands build customer value.

With 30-40% gross margins typical for home decor, your $85-95 orders generate roughly $25-40 contribution per sale. At $50 acquisition cost, you're break-even to slightly negative on first purchase, but the repeat business and furniture upgrades drive profitability - that's a solid model.

Your $50 target is achievable because you can optimize for engagement signals that predict repeat purchases rather than just immediate conversions. Customers who browse multiple categories or spend time with room inspiration content often become your high-LTV buyers.

This completes our economics foundation. You're targeting quality customers at aggressive but realistic efficiency, with a business model that supports initial investment for long-term returns.

Ready to move to Step 3 and define your ideal customer audience?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Perfect starting point. Let's sharpen that profile to improve your $50 efficiency target.

Within homeowners 30-55 with middle to upper-middle income, there are distinct segments with different LTV potential. Some are occasional decorators, others are frequent home refreshers who become your repeat furniture buyers.

To identify your highest-LTV prospects, what behavioral signals do you see from customers who graduate from accessories to furniture purchases? For example, do they browse multiple room categories initially, engage with styling content, or make purchases in clusters during specific seasons?

These engagement patterns will help us target people likely to follow that valuable progression path rather than just one-time accessory buyers.

Turn 6:
Excellent insights! Those behavioral signals are gold for targeting. Customers who engage with style guides, browse multiple rooms, and compare aesthetics are showing high intent for the home transformation journey that drives repeat purchases.

The seasonal pattern is valuable too - spring/fall refresh cycles leading to furniture investments 6-9 months later maps perfectly to your LTV model.

Beyond those engagement behaviors, what demographic or lifestyle characteristics do you notice? For instance, are these customers more likely to be new homeowners, recent movers, or established homeowners doing periodic updates? And do you see differences between urban apartment dwellers versus suburban house owners in terms of purchase patterns?

This helps us layer demographic targeting with those behavioral signals for precision.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Perfect segmentation! You've identified two distinct high-value paths:

**Urban Segment (25-40):** Trend-conscious, multi-functional pieces, faster decision cycles
**Suburban Segment (35-50):** Family-focused, durability-driven, full room collections

Both segments show strong LTV potential but through different purchase journeys. Urban customers likely have higher frequency but smaller average orders, while suburban customers have larger orders but longer consideration cycles.

For geographic targeting, which metro areas or regions currently drive your strongest performance? Are there specific markets where you see higher concentrations of either segment, or particular cities where the suburban vs urban split affects purchase behavior?

This helps us allocate your $750K budget geographically for maximum efficiency.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
Excellent geographic clarity! California and Texas representing 40% of your base with strong engagement is powerful data. Those coastal metros for urban targeting and suburban markets for family collections gives us clear allocation strategy.

This geographic concentration actually supports your $50 efficiency target - focused spending in proven markets typically outperforms broad national campaigns by 20-30%.

Your audience definition is solid: two distinct segments with clear geographic clusters, behavioral engagement patterns, and different purchase journeys that both lead to high LTV. 

Ready to move to Step 5 and determine how to allocate your $750K budget across these segments and geographies? We'll want to balance investment between your proven California/Texas strongholds and expansion opportunities.

Turn 9:
Smart thinking - balance proven performance with strategic expansion. Let me model your allocation based on performance data and growth potential.

**Proven Markets (California/Texas) - 60% = $450K**
- These drive 40% of your current base with strong engagement
- Lower acquisition costs due to proven creative/audience fit
- Foundation for hitting your aggressive $50 target

**Adjacent Expansion Markets - 25% = $187.5K**
- Seattle, Boston, Atlanta, Denver metros with similar demographics
- Test similar messaging with geographic customization
- Expect 20-30% higher acquisition costs initially

**Reserve/Testing - 15% = $112.5K**
- New market testing and creative optimization
- Seasonal campaign amplification
- Performance reallocation based on Q1-Q2 learnings

This 60/25/15 split balances efficiency with growth. Your proven markets anchor performance while expansion markets build scale.

Between your urban and suburban segments, do you see different profitability or should we weight the budget equally, or does one segment show stronger LTV that deserves more investment?

Turn 10:
Perfect insight! Higher LTV suburban customers deserve the budget weighting. Let me update the allocation:

**Suburban Focus (60% of $750K = $450K):**
- Atlanta, Dallas, Chicago, Denver metros plus suburban TX/CA
- Targeting families 35-50, durability-focused messaging
- Room collection campaigns, seasonal refresh timing

**Urban Complement (40% of $750K = $300K):**
- Seattle, SF, Boston, NYC metros
- Targeting 25-40, trend-conscious, space-saving focus
- Individual piece campaigns, faster decision cycles

This 60/40 split aligns budget with your LTV data while maintaining urban market presence for volume and brand awareness.

Within each segment's budget, we'll still apply the 60/25/15 geographic split between proven markets, adjacent expansion, and testing.

Your budget allocation is set. Ready for Step 6 to develop your value propositions? We'll want different messaging frameworks for suburban "family-focused durability" versus urban "trend-conscious functionality" to maximize that $50 acquisition efficiency.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 12:
Perfect positioning! Those refined value propositions nail each segment's psychology:

**Suburban: "Investment pieces that last"**
- Speaks to practical mindset and family durability needs
- Justifies higher price points as smart long-term decisions
- Aligns with their room collection purchase behavior

**Urban: "Curated design aesthetic"**
- Appeals to their sophisticated taste and style consciousness
- Positions your brand as design expert/tastemaker
- Connects with their style guide engagement patterns

These propositions will drive the engagement behaviors that predict your high-LTV customers - suburban families researching room collections for lasting value, urban professionals exploring curated style guides.

Your value proposition framework is solid and directly supports your $50 acquisition target by attracting quality customers who engage deeply before purchasing.

Ready for Step 7? We'll determine which channels best reach these segments with these specific messages to optimize your 60/40 suburban/urban budget split.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 11:
Excellent! Let's build value propositions that connect with each segment's core motivations and drive that high-engagement behavior you identified.

**Suburban Value Proposition Framework:**
*"Transform your family's spaces with collections built to last"*
- Core promise: Durable style that grows with your family
- Proof points: Quality materials, timeless design, room cohesion
- Emotional hook: Creating lasting memories in beautiful spaces

**Urban Value Proposition Framework:**
*"Smart design that maximizes your space and style"*
- Core promise: Trend-forward pieces that work harder
- Proof points: Multi-functional, space-saving, design-led
- Emotional hook: Your space reflects your sophisticated taste

Both emphasize the style guide engagement that predicts your best customers.

For suburban messaging, should we lean more into "investment pieces that last" or "effortless room transformation"? And for urban, does "maximizing small spaces" or "curated design aesthetic" resonate stronger with your current high-LTV urban customers?

Turn 13:
Perfect! Your style guide engagement is the key to finding high-LTV customers. Let me recommend channels that excel at design inspiration and match your segment behaviors.

**Suburban Segment Channels (60% = $450K):**
- **Pinterest (35%)** - Peak platform for home inspiration, room planning
- **Facebook/Meta (30%)** - Strong suburban reach, room collection showcases
- **Google Search (25%)** - Captures "living room furniture sets" intent
- **YouTube (10%)** - Room transformation content, durability demos

**Urban Segment Channels (40% = $300K):**
- **Instagram (40%)** - Design-forward content, apartment styling
- **Google Search (30%)** - "small space furniture" high-intent searches
- **Pinterest (20%)** - Curated aesthetic boards, space-saving ideas
- **TikTok (10%)** - Trend-conscious audience, quick design tips

Both mixes prioritize visual platforms where style guides perform best. Pinterest and Instagram excel at the browsing behavior that predicts your repeat customers.

Which of these channels have you tested before, and did any show particularly strong engagement with your style guide content?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 10: Risks

Turn 14:
Excellent data! Pinterest and Instagram success validates your visual content strategy. Let me adjust the channel mix based on your proven performance:

**Suburban Segment Channels (60% = $450K):**
- **Pinterest (45%)** - Your proven engagement driver for room inspiration
- **Facebook/Meta (25%)** - Focus on 35+ suburban demographics where you see response
- **Google Search (25%)** - Capture high-intent furniture searches
- **YouTube (5%)** - Test room transformation content

**Urban Segment Channels (40% = $300K):**
- **Instagram (50%)** - Your proven urban platform for design content
- **Pinterest (25%)** - Leverage your style guide success for urban aesthetics
- **Google Search (20%)** - Small space/apartment furniture intent
- **TikTok (5%)** - Test trend-conscious younger urban audience

This reallocation doubles down on Pinterest (your style guide winner) and Instagram (urban engagement leader) while maintaining search for direct conversions.

Ready for Step 8? We'll set up measurement to track not just $50 acquisition cost, but the engagement signals that predict your high-LTV repeat customers across these channels.

Turn 15:
Excellent mindset! Testing those 5% allocations on TikTok and YouTube could reveal new high-LTV segments as platforms evolve.

For measurement that captures your LTV focus, we need both acquisition efficiency AND engagement quality metrics:

**Primary KPIs:**
- Cost per customer (target $50)
- 90-day repeat purchase rate (benchmark: 30-40% for home decor)
- Style guide engagement rate (your proven LTV predictor)

**Channel-Specific Leading Indicators:**
- Pinterest: Save rates, multi-board engagement, room collection views
- Instagram: Story completion rates, carousel swipes, profile visits
- Google: Multi-category search sessions, time on style guides
- Facebook: Video view completion, link clicks to inspiration content

**LTV Prediction Signals:**
- Customers browsing 3+ room categories (your identified pattern)
- 5+ minutes on style guide content
- Seasonal purchase timing alignment

This measurement framework tracks immediate efficiency while identifying engagement behaviors that predict your 6-9 month furniture upgrade path.

Ready for Step 9? We'll design tests to optimize these metrics and potentially discover new high-LTV customer signals across your channel mix.

Turn 16:
Perfect! Your measurement framework is solid - now let's design tests to optimize those LTV-predicting signals and uncover new opportunities.

**Core Testing Framework:**

**Test 1: Style Guide Optimization (Month 1-2)**
- A/B test room inspiration formats: static galleries vs interactive room builders
- Measure: multi-category browsing rates, time on content, 90-day repeat rates
- Budget: 10% of Pinterest/Instagram spend

**Test 2: Seasonal Messaging (Month 2-3)**
- Test "spring refresh" vs "investment pieces" messaging for suburban segment
- Measure: engagement depth, furniture upgrade conversion rates
- Budget: 15% of suburban Facebook allocation

**Test 3: Urban Platform Expansion (Month 3-4)**
- Scale TikTok apartment styling content based on engagement signals
- Test YouTube room transformation series for discovery
- Measure: new customer acquisition quality vs Instagram baseline

**Test 4: Cross-Channel Journey Optimization (Month 4-5)**
- Test Pinterest → Instagram retargeting for urban curated aesthetic messaging
- Measure: cross-platform engagement, purchase progression timing

Each test validates your LTV prediction model while potentially discovering new high-value customer signals.

Which test excites you most, or should we prioritize based on your current campaign calendar?
