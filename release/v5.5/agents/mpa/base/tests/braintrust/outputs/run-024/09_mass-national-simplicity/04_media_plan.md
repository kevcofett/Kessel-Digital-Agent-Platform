# Media Plan Output: Mass National Campaign - Simplicity Test

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

For your FreshBite launch, I want to make sure we define success precisely. You mentioned brand awareness, but what specific business outcome are you trying to achieve? Are you looking to establish FreshBite as a recognized brand name, drive trial purchases of the new line, or position against specific competitors in the snack category?

Turn 2:
Perfect - establishing brand credibility and driving trial is clear. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success as a number.

You mentioned brand lift studies. What specific metric will tell you this campaign succeeded? Are you tracking unaided brand awareness, purchase intent, brand consideration, or something else? And what's your target - for example, moving from X% to Y% awareness?

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using a reasonable assumption based on snack industry benchmarks, and you can adjust anytime. For national snack launches with $8M budgets, reaching 2-3 million trial households in six months is typical. Let me use 2.5 million households as our working target.

$8M / 2.5M households = $3.20 per trial household. For brand awareness campaigns driving trial, this is conservative - typical runs $2-5 per household reached effectively.

Your plan looks feasible from an efficiency standpoint. Moving on, you mentioned adults 18-54 who buy snacks. That's about 140 million people nationally. To hit your aggressive awareness target of 15-20%, we'll need tight targeting within that broad demographic.

What behavioral signals define your ideal customer beyond age? Do they prioritize healthy options, convenience, specific occasions like work snacks versus family sharing?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - 15-20% unaided awareness from zero is ambitious and measurable. Now I need the volume piece to complete our objective.

With your $8M budget driving awareness to support trial, what's your target for actual customers or trial volume? Are you aiming for a specific number of households to try FreshBite, or do you have a sales target for the new line in the first six months?

Turn 5:
Perfect - health-conscious urban/suburban professionals is much more targeted than general snack buyers. This significantly improves your efficiency potential.

Your audience profile suggests people who shop at premium grocers, follow wellness content, and prioritize convenience. This narrows your 140M adults 18-54 to roughly 25-30M highly qualified prospects - a much better fit for driving 15-20% awareness.

For geography, you mentioned national launch. Are you prioritizing specific markets first, or truly launching coast-to-coast simultaneously? Premium better-for-you snacks typically perform strongest in major metros and affluent suburbs initially.

Turn 7:
Perfect - $5.6M for media with $2.4M for creative and research is a solid allocation. Quality creative is essential for brand awareness campaigns.

Your media math: $5.6M / 2.5M trial households = $2.24 per household for media alone. This is very efficient for national brand building and supports your 15-20% awareness goal.

Now let's define what makes FreshBite compelling to health-conscious professionals. Beyond "better-for-you" ingredients, what's your unique value proposition? Are you emphasizing specific benefits like protein content, clean labels, sustainability, taste, or convenience packaging that differentiates you from both traditional snacks and other premium options?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Excellent - national coverage with regional performance tracking is smart. Let me structure your geography for optimal analysis.

I'll set up DMA-level tracking across all 210 US markets, which gives you national reach while enabling regional performance insights. This lets you maintain consistent coverage but identify which metros over-deliver for future optimization.

**FRESHBITE GEOGRAPHY PLAN - PHASE 1**

| Geography Level | Coverage | Total Population | Target Audience Size | Target Audience % |
|----------------|----------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| National - All DMAs | 210 DMAs | 335,000,000 | 28,000,000 | 8.4% |

Your 28M health-conscious professionals represent 8.4% of total US population - this concentration supports your $3.20 per household efficiency target.

Now for budget allocation. You have $8M total. What percentage are you planning for media spend versus creative production, research, and other campaign costs?

Turn 9:
Smart channel selection - CTV, YouTube, traditional TV, and targeted display aligns perfectly with your audience and awareness goals.

**FRESHBITE CHANNEL ALLOCATION - $5.6M MEDIA BUDGET**

| Channel | Budget | % of Media | Rationale |
|---------|---------|------------|-----------|
| Connected TV | $2.0M | 36% | Prime reach for streaming professionals |
| YouTube | $1.4M | 25% | Wellness content alignment + video storytelling |
| Traditional TV | $1.4M | 25% | Broad awareness + frequency |
| Targeted Display | $0.8M | 14% | Professional/wellness site targeting |
| **TOTAL** | **$5.6M** | **100%** | |

This mix projects to reach 85-90% of your target audience with 8-12 frequency over six months - strong foundation for 15-20% unaided awareness.

For measurement beyond brand lift studies, what other metrics will you track to validate campaign performance? Are you monitoring website traffic, social engagement, or retail velocity as leading indicators?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Excellent positioning - "clean ingredients without taste compromise" for busy professionals is differentiated and relevant. The sustainable sourcing and smart packaging add credibility to your premium positioning.

**FRESHBITE VALUE PROPOSITION FRAMEWORK**
- **Primary Promise:** Crave-worthy taste meets clean ingredients
- **Functional Benefits:** Convenient packaging, sustainable sourcing, non-GMO
- **Emotional Payoff:** Smart snacking choice for health-conscious professionals
- **Proof Points:** Minimally processed, resealable design, farm-sourced

This messaging foundation supports both trial and awareness goals. Now for channels.

With $5.6M media budget targeting 28M health-conscious professionals nationally, what channels are you considering? Are you thinking traditional reach drivers like TV and digital video, or more targeted approaches through social and digital platforms where your audience consumes wellness content?

Turn 10:
Excellent measurement framework - you're tracking the full funnel from awareness to purchase behavior.

**FRESHBITE MEASUREMENT DASHBOARD**

| **Awareness Metrics** | **Engagement Metrics** | **Action Metrics** |
|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Unaided brand awareness (15-20% target) | Website time on site | Retail sell-through rates |
| Brand lift study results | Pages per session | Distribution velocity |
| Share of voice vs competitors | Social engagement rate | Trial household penetration |
| | Follower growth & sentiment | |

This gives you leading indicators (traffic, social) and lagging validation (brand lift, retail).

For testing, what elements do you want to optimize during the campaign? Are you planning to test different creative messages, audience segments, or channel allocations to improve performance?

Turn 11:
Perfect - testing messaging, audience segments, and channel performance gives you maximum learning from this launch investment.

**FRESHBITE TESTING FRAMEWORK**

| **Creative Tests** | **Audience Tests** | **Channel Tests** |
|------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Health-focused messaging | Tech professionals | CTV vs YouTube efficiency |
| Taste-focused messaging | Fitness enthusiasts | Traditional TV reach optimization |
| Blended health + taste | General health-conscious | Display site performance |

I recommend 70% budget on proven baseline creative with 30% ($1.7M) for testing. This protects your core awareness goal while generating optimization insights.

Finally, what risks concern you most about this launch? Market timing, competitive response, or execution challenges that could impact your 15-20% awareness target?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 12:
Smart concern - competitive saturation is real in premium snacks, and established brands have deeper pockets for counter-campaigns.

**FRESHBITE RISK MITIGATION PLAN**

| **Risk** | **Likelihood** | **Impact** | **Mitigation Strategy** |
|----------|---------------|------------|----------------------|
| Competitive counter-campaigns | High | High | Front-load 60% budget in first 8 weeks for fast awareness |
| Message dilution in crowded market | Medium | High | Focus testing on most differentiated messaging early |
| Slower awareness build than projected | Medium | Medium | Weekly tracking with reallocation triggers at 4-week mark |
