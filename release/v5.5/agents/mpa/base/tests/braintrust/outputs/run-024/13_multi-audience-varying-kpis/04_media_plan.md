# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience with Different KPIs Per Segment

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build this multi-segment media plan with you. You've outlined a sophisticated tri-objective strategy that requires different approaches for each funnel stage. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks.

Your three-segment approach is smart - conquest awareness, in-market performance, and loyalty retention each need distinct strategies. Let me start with the conquest segment since awareness campaigns have the longest attribution windows.

For Segment 1 (Conquest/Awareness) at ~$1.6M budget: What specific brand lift or awareness metrics will define success? Are you tracking aided/unaided brand awareness, consideration shift, or dealer visit intent among competitor owners?

Turn 2:
Perfect. 15-20% consideration shift among competitor owners over 18 months is your primary KPI for conquest. That's a substantial brand lift target requiring sustained reach and frequency.

Let me model the efficiency implications. At $1.6M for conquest awareness, you're investing roughly $133K per month over 18 months. For automotive awareness campaigns, cost-per-thousand-reached typically runs $8-15 depending on channels and targeting precision.

At $12 CPM average, $1.6M delivers approximately 133M impressions. To achieve 15-20% consideration shift among competitor owners, you'll need sustained 3-5x monthly frequency against your target audience.

This is an ambitious but achievable target if your audience definition is precise. Broad "all competitor owners" dilutes impact, but tight targeting on "Toyota/Honda owners aged 35-55 with 2019-2021 vehicles approaching trade cycle" concentrates investment.

For Segment 2 (In-Market Lead Gen) at ~$2M budget: What's your target lead volume and acceptable cost-per-lead for active shoppers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent data. 3,000 leads monthly at $250 CPL targets = $750K monthly spend, which fits your $2M annual in-market budget perfectly. Your 22% lead-to-appointment conversion is strong - industry average runs 15-18%.

The brand efficiency spread is telling. $175 Hyundai vs $400 luxury suggests audience targeting differences, not just price point. Luxury buyers have longer consideration windows and require more touchpoints, driving up acquisition costs.

At current performance: Hyundai efficiency allows volume scaling, while luxury needs audience precision improvements to hit your $250 blended target.

For Segment 3 (Loyalty/Retention) at ~$900K budget: What's your target volume for retention actions, and what's the typical value of a retained customer versus acquiring new ones? Are you tracking service appointment rates, trade-in conversion, or lease renewal percentages as primary KPIs?

Turn 5:
Excellent targeting foundation. Toyota Camry/Honda Accord owners aged 35-54, $85-150K HHI, with 3-4 year old vehicles creates a precise conquest audience. Adding luxury sedan owners seeking value creates a secondary tier.

This audience definition is smart - you're targeting the natural upgrade path from mainstream to premium value. 3-4 year ownership timing catches them before major repair decisions while equity is still strong.

For in-market shoppers: Are you seeing different behavioral patterns across your three brands? Do Hyundai shoppers research differently than luxury buyers, or visit different digital touchpoints before converting to leads?

Turn 6:
Perfect insight. The 6-8 week luxury research cycle versus 2-3 week Hyundai cycle explains your CPL variance. Luxury requires multiple touchpoints across review sites and video content, while Hyundai can convert on direct response.

This suggests your luxury segment needs awareness-style frequency building before conversion, while Hyundai can focus on immediate capture tactics. That's why luxury hits $400 CPL - you're competing for attention during extended consideration.

For loyalty audiences: Can you segment your existing customers by service history, purchase timing, or lease expiration dates? Are recent buyers, service-only customers, and approaching-lease-end customers equally responsive to retention marketing?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using reasonable assumptions for automotive retention and flag where you can refine. 

At $900K annually targeting 2,500 monthly service appointments = $30 per service appointment. That's extremely efficient - typical automotive service marketing runs $75-150 per appointment. Your existing customer advantage creates this efficiency.

15% conversion from service to sales discussions projects to 375 monthly sales conversations from retention efforts. If 25% of those convert (typical for warm leads), that's ~95 monthly sales from retention at roughly $95 per sale lead.

Your retention segment has the strongest economics but needs measurement infrastructure. The 3-4x efficiency advantage you mentioned is conservative - retention typically outperforms acquisition by 5-8x when properly tracked.

Now let's define your audiences. Starting with conquest: Beyond "competitor owners approaching trade cycle," what demographic and behavioral signals help identify your highest-value conquest targets? Age ranges, household income, or specific competitor models that convert best to your brands?

Turn 8:
Perfect. Two major metros with 15-20% performance deltas absolutely requires geo-weighted allocation. Midwest strength in Hyundai/Kia and Southeast luxury performance creates clear optimization opportunities.

Urban vs suburban dynamics add another layer - faster urban conversion suggests different media mix needs than higher-value suburban markets.

Let me structure your geography targeting. I'll need the specific DMAs to model audience sizing and budget allocation. What are your two primary metro markets?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Excellent segmentation. 40% conversion for lease-end customers with personalized messaging is outstanding - that's your highest-value retention audience. Recent buyers and service-only customers need different approaches but both offer strong ROI opportunities.

Your CRM limitation is common - most dealership systems aren't built for sophisticated marketing automation. This affects message personalization but doesn't prevent segment-based campaigns.

Now for geography: Are your 12 dealerships clustered in specific markets, or spread across multiple DMAs? Do you see performance differences by location that should influence budget allocation across markets?

Turn 9:
Excellent markets. Minneapolis-St. Paul and Atlanta offer distinct demographic advantages that align perfectly with your brand performance patterns.

Minneapolis DMA: ~1.8M households, median HHI $75K, fits your pragmatic Hyundai/Kia buyer profile
Atlanta DMA: ~2.5M households, median HHI $65K but higher luxury aspiration index, perfect for premium positioning

The 6 dealerships per market creates good coverage without oversaturation. Atlanta's larger market size suggests potential for higher budget allocation, but Minneapolis efficiency might justify equal investment.

Now for budget allocation across your three segments and two markets. You mentioned $4.5M total: 35% conquest ($1.6M), 45% in-market ($2M), 20% retention ($900K).

Given Atlanta's 40% larger market size but Minneapolis's higher efficiency, how do you want to weight budget between markets? Equal 50/50 split, or should Atlanta's size advantage drive higher allocation?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Smart allocation strategy. 60/40 Atlanta weighting with segment-specific adjustments maximizes each market's strengths.

Let me model the allocation:

**Atlanta (60% overall):**
- Conquest: $1.1M (69% of $1.6M) - leverages luxury market opportunity
- In-Market: $1.4M (70% of $2M) - captures larger market size
- Retention: $450K (50% of $900K) - matches customer distribution

**Minneapolis (40% overall):**
- Conquest: $500K (31% of $1.6M) - concentrated precision targeting
- In-Market: $600K (30% of $2M) - efficiency-focused volume
- Retention: $450K (50% of $900K) - equal customer service investment

This gives Atlanta $2.95M and Minneapolis $1.55M, creating the 60/40 split while optimizing segment performance by market strengths.

For value proposition: How do you differentiate your conquest messaging between "Toyota owners considering upgrade" versus "luxury sedan owners seeking value"? Do these audiences need completely different value propositions?

Turn 11:
Perfect value prop differentiation. "Smart upgrade, same reliability" for Toyota owners and "Intelligent luxury without the premium tax" for luxury conquest creates distinct positioning that speaks to each audience's motivations.

Your 80% luxury experience at 50% price positioning is compelling for luxury conquest - it acknowledges their standards while highlighting value arbitrage.

Now for channels. Given your three distinct objectives and two markets, we need different channel strategies:

**Conquest (Awareness):** Needs sustained reach and frequency for 18-month consideration shift
**In-Market (Performance):** Needs immediate capture at point of research  
**Retention (CRM-driven):** Needs personalized touchpoints with existing customers

Starting with conquest awareness in Atlanta: What channels do you think will most effectively reach Toyota/Honda owners and luxury sedan owners with sustained frequency over 18 months?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 12:
Excellent channel strategy. CTV/YouTube for mainstream conquest and premium automotive content sponsorships for luxury creates appropriate environment alignment. Traditional TV for sports/news adds broad reach against your professional demographic.

Your "omnipresent but sophisticated" approach is crucial for 18-month consideration building. The premium placement strategy for luxury conquest will drive higher CPMs but delivers qualified impressions.

For in-market performance: Given your insight about Hyundai shoppers on Autotrader/Cars.com versus luxury buyers researching on review sites, what channels will capture each segment at their point of decision?

Turn 13:
Perfect channel precision. Direct response for Hyundai/Kia on shopping platforms versus luxury nurturing through research content aligns with their different decision timelines.

25-mile geo-targeting for Hyundai maximizes local relevance, while longer cookie windows for luxury captures their extended research cycle. Multi-touch attribution for luxury is essential given their 6-8 week consideration period.

For retention: Given your three loyalty sub-segments (recent buyers, service-only, lease-end), what channels will most effectively reach existing customers for service appointments and trade-in discussions?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 14:
Excellent retention approach. CRM-triggered personalization with dynamic creative based on vehicle/service history creates the 1:1 experience despite system limitations.

Personalized video walkarounds for lease-end customers is particularly smart - 40% conversion rates justify that investment. Service reminder texts for recent buyers and maintenance offers for service-only customers match each segment's needs perfectly.

Now for measurement. Your three segments need completely different success metrics:

**Conquest:** Brand lift and consideration shift (18-month tracking)
**In-Market:** Lead volume, CPL, and lead-to-appointment conversion 
**Retention:** Service appointments and trade-in conversation rates

How will you track brand consideration shift for conquest, and what attribution windows will you use for each segment given their different decision timelines?
