# Media Plan Output: Geography Expansion Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've given me a great foundation - $2.5M budget targeting 500,000 visits/conversions for active adults 25-45 in the US. Let me clarify your primary objective.

When you say "store visits and online conversions combined," what's the main business outcome you're driving toward - is this about increasing brand awareness, driving immediate sales, or building long-term customer relationships?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect - driving immediate sales and market share growth with actual purchases as the primary outcome. Let me calculate your efficiency target: $2.5M ÷ 500,000 conversions = $5 per conversion.

That's extremely aggressive for athletic apparel. Typical cost per conversion in this space runs $15-25 based on industry benchmarks. At $5, you're targeting 70-80% better efficiency than market standard.

To validate if this is achievable, what's your average order value when someone makes a purchase? This will help us assess if the unit economics work at your target efficiency.

Turn 4:
Excellent. With your $5 efficiency target being 70% better than typical, we need exceptional targeting precision - likely 20-30 audience signals to hit this level.

Let's start with behavioral signals since these predict purchase intent best. Beyond general fitness enthusiasm, what specific fitness activities or behaviors define your highest-value customers? 

For example: gym membership types, specific sports (running, CrossFit, yoga), fitness app usage, athletic event participation, or particular workout routines?

Turn 5:
Perfect - that's exactly the precision we need for your aggressive efficiency target. CrossFit/HIIT participants with running app usage and race participation creates a highly defined behavioral profile.

This audience likely represents 3-5% of the broader "fitness enthusiast" market, which actually works in your favor. Tight targeting reduces waste and increases relevance.

Now for geographic layering - within the US, are there specific regions, metro areas, or even neighborhood types where your brand performs strongest? Markets with higher CrossFit gym density, running communities, or particular income demographics?

This will help us concentrate budget where conversion probability is highest.

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Got it. With $180 AOV and $5 acquisition cost, you'd have a 36:1 return ratio - that's exceptional if achievable. For athletic apparel, healthy margins typically run 50-65%. I'll model at 55% margin, so you'd make roughly $99 profit per $180 sale. You can refine this anytime.

Even with strong brand resonance, $5 per conversion is ambitious. High-performing athletic brands typically achieve $15-25. To hit your target, we'd need extremely tight audience targeting and channel efficiency.

This is definitely aggressive but let's build the plan to maximize your chances. Your 500,000 conversion target at $180 AOV projects to $90M in revenue - that's substantial growth that would certainly drive market share.

Ready to move to Step 3 and define your target audience more precisely?

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent - you're targeting fitness-forward metros with high disposable income. Denver, Austin, Seattle, Boston, and Bay Area align perfectly with your CrossFit/HIIT audience.

These markets likely represent 15-20% of the US population but could drive 40-50% of your conversions given the audience-geography fit. This geographic concentration will help your $5 efficiency target by reducing waste in low-affinity markets.

Let me calculate the audience size: CrossFit/HIIT participants with running apps in these metros likely represents 2-3 million people. Your 500,000 conversion target would need roughly 17% of this audience to convert - ambitious but focused.

Ready to move to budget allocation? We'll determine how to distribute your $2.5M across these priority markets and whether this concentration gives you the efficiency edge you need.

Turn 7:
Let me update our projections. Adding Canada and Mexico spreads your $2.5M across three countries for 500,000 conversions, keeping your $5 efficiency target.

This makes things more challenging. Your tight US metros (Denver, Austin, Seattle, Boston, Bay Area) were already a concentrated 2-3 million audience. Adding Canada and Mexico expands your addressable market significantly but dilutes budget concentration - the opposite of what aggressive efficiency targets need.

Quick assessment: If you allocate roughly 60% US, 30% Canada, 10% Mexico based on market maturity, you'd have $1.5M for 300,000 US conversions, $750K for 150,000 Canadian conversions, and $250K for 50,000 Mexican conversions.

This creates different efficiency challenges per market. Canadian CACs typically run 20-30% higher than US, and Mexico would be largely experimental.

Do you want to adjust the total target to 500,000 conversions across all three markets, or should we recalibrate the budget to maintain realistic efficiency expectations?

Turn 8:
Perfect adjustment. So we're back to $2.5M for 500,000 US conversions = $5 efficiency target, plus expansion budgets for Canada/Mexico targeting 50,000-75,000 additional conversions.

This refocuses our core plan on those high-performing US metros where your CrossFit/HIIT audience is concentrated. The expansion markets become learning labs without compromising your primary efficiency goals.

For the expansion piece - are you thinking an additional budget beyond the $2.5M, or should we carve out a portion (say $300-400K) from the $2.5M for international expansion while keeping the majority focused on US performance?

This affects whether your US efficiency target stays at $5 or becomes even more aggressive if we reduce the US allocation.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Excellent - $2.5M for 500,000 US conversions maintaining your $5 target, plus $500K expansion budget for 50,000-75,000 international conversions.

This keeps your core efficiency challenge focused while creating proper learning budgets for expansion. Canada and Mexico will likely run $7-10 per conversion given market dynamics, but that's reasonable for expansion phases.

Total program: $3M budget targeting 550,000-575,000 conversions across three markets, with disciplined US focus where your CrossFit/HIIT audience in those fitness-forward metros gives you the best shot at aggressive efficiency.

Ready to move to Step 6 and develop your value proposition? We need messaging that resonates specifically with CrossFit/HIIT participants and running enthusiasts to maximize conversion rates in your target markets.

Turn 10:
Perfect - "gear engineered for high-intensity training" positions you as performance equipment, not just apparel. That technical positioning should resonate strongly with CrossFit/HIIT athletes who view gear as training tools.

Your "part of their training ecosystem" approach is smart - it aligns with how these athletes think about performance optimization. They invest in equipment that delivers measurable benefits.

Key messaging pillars I'm hearing: technical engineering, extreme durability, peak performance enablement. This should differentiate you from lifestyle fitness brands and connect with your audience's performance mindset.

Now we're ready for Step 7 - channel selection. Given your $5 efficiency target, performance-focused value prop, and highly defined CrossFit/HIIT audience in specific metros, which channels are you currently considering, or do you want recommendations based on where this audience is most reachable and convertible?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Perfect timing for channel strategy. With your $5 efficiency target and highly defined audience, you need precision targeting and direct response capability.

Here's my recommended channel mix for your $2.5M US budget:

**Paid Social (40% - $1M)**: Meta and Instagram for CrossFit/HIIT interest targeting, custom audiences from Strava/fitness app users, lookalikes from your best customers. Strong creative showcase for technical gear.

**Paid Search (35% - $875K)**: Google for high-intent searches like "CrossFit gear," "HIIT apparel," brand terms. Captures existing demand efficiently.

**Programmatic Display (15% - $375K)**: Retargeting website visitors, targeting fitness/CrossFit websites and apps where your audience consumes content.

**Influencer (10% - $250K)**: Partnerships with CrossFit athletes, HIIT trainers, obstacle race participants. Authentic endorsements in your target communities.

This mix prioritizes precision targeting and measurable performance. The 75% digital allocation matches your audience's digital-native behavior.

Does this channel allocation align with your performance expectations, or should we adjust the mix?
