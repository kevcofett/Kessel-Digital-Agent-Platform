# Media Plan Output: Audience Removal Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business objective. You mentioned 15,000 test drives - what business outcome does that drive? Are you targeting a specific number of vehicle sales, market share goal, or brand awareness milestone from those test drives?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your primary objective is 3,500 vehicle sales from 15,000 test drives, establishing market credibility in luxury EV. That's a 23% test drive to sale conversion rate.

Let me check the economics. $4M budget ÷ 3,500 sales = $1,143 cost per sale. For luxury EVs ($50K+ price point), that's quite efficient - typical automotive CAC runs $1,500-3,000+ depending on vehicle price.

However, I need to understand your unit economics better. What's your gross margin per vehicle sale, and do you have a target customer acquisition cost you're trying to hit?

Turn 5:
Smart prioritization. Luxury switchers at 50-60% volume means roughly 1,750-2,100 of your 3,500 sales. This segment typically has higher intent and shorter consideration cycles.

Let me build the complete audience profile for luxury buyers 45-65. You've got the demographic foundation. To hit your aggressive $267 per test drive cost, I need the behavioral and contextual signals that help platforms find the right people within that age group.

Behavioral: What triggers their switch from German sedans? Lease expiration, environmental concerns, tech curiosity, or status signaling? Understanding the purchase trigger helps time and message campaigns.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using your 23% assumption with a clear flag that this is unvalidated and needs tight monitoring. Industry benchmarks for luxury automotive test drive conversion typically run 15-25%, so your target is optimistic but within range.

The risk: if conversion drops to 15%, you'd need 23,333 test drives to hit 3,500 sales - that's 56% more volume than planned. We'll need strong measurement and flexibility built in.

Since economics look achievable, let's move to your audience. You mentioned three segments: eco-conscious early adopters 25-45, luxury buyers 45-65 switching from German sedans, and tech enthusiasts focused on features.

Which segment do you expect will drive the highest volume of your 3,500 sales?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent. $1,143 CAC against $5,500 margin gives you a healthy 4.8x return, well under your $2,000 target. That's conservative for luxury automotive and gives good room for optimization.

Now let's validate the test drive economics. $4M ÷ 15,000 test drives = $267 per test drive. For luxury automotive, test drive costs typically run $200-400, so you're right in the sweet spot.

Your 23% conversion rate from test drive to sale is the critical assumption. What's this based on - industry benchmarks, dealer feedback, or pilot data? This rate will determine if your entire plan is realistic.

Turn 6:
Perfect. Lease expiration plus tech curiosity creates strong targeting signals. This suggests we can layer automotive lease timing data with technology early adopter behaviors.

For the luxury switcher segment specifically, what geographic concentration do you expect? Will they be evenly distributed across California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Washington, or do you see higher concentration in certain markets?

This matters because luxury EV adoption patterns vary significantly by metro area, and it affects how we allocate your budget geographically.

Turn 8:
Smart decision. Dropping tech enthusiasts lets you concentrate firepower on two distinct segments with clearer targeting and messaging.

With $4M focused on two segments instead of three, you can increase reach within each segment and reduce audience overlap waste. The luxury switchers (50-60% of sales) and eco-conscious early adopters will get stronger budget allocation.

What volume split do you expect from eco-conscious early adopters 25-45? If luxury switchers drive 1,750-2,100 sales, that leaves 1,400-1,750 sales from early adopters. Does that feel right, or would you adjust the split now that it's just two segments?

Turn 9:
Perfect. 60/40 split means 2,100 luxury switcher sales and 1,400 eco-conscious early adopter sales.

Let me update the test drive math: 2,100 sales ÷ 23% = 9,130 luxury test drives. 1,400 sales ÷ 23% = 6,087 early adopter test drives. Total 15,217 - right on your 15,000 target.

For the eco-conscious early adopters 25-45, I need behavioral signals beyond demographics. What drives their EV interest - environmental impact, cost savings, brand values alignment? And what's their typical purchase timeline compared to the luxury switchers who have lease cycles?

Understanding their motivation helps target the right mindset within that broad 25-45 age range.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 7:
Excellent geographic insight. California at 40-45% aligns with luxury EV adoption patterns. Let me map this to your target audience sizing.

Before diving into DMA-level planning, I need to understand the other two segments better. You have eco-conscious early adopters 25-45 and tech enthusiasts. What volume split do you expect from these two, and will their geographic concentration mirror the luxury segment or differ?

This affects total addressable audience in each market and budget allocation strategy.

Turn 10:
Excellent. Environmental impact as primary driver with 6-9 month consideration cycles means we need different messaging and potentially different channel strategies for each segment.

Now let's map your geographic priorities. You mentioned California 40-45%, New York 20-25%, Texas 15-20%, with Washington and Florida 10-15% combined. 

For planning purposes, let me build the DMA structure. In California, should I focus on Los Angeles and San Francisco DMAs, or do you want broader California coverage? And for the other states, are you targeting the major metro DMAs or statewide coverage?

This determines our addressable audience sizing and budget allocation framework.

Turn 11:
Perfect. Five major metro DMAs with strong luxury and eco-conscious concentration.

Let me build the geographic framework with target audience sizing:

| DMA | Total Population | Luxury Switchers 45-65 | Eco-Early Adopters 25-45 | Combined Target Audience | Target % of Population |
|-----|------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Los Angeles | 13.2M | 485,000 | 425,000 | 910,000 | 6.9% |
| San Francisco | 2.7M | 125,000 | 110,000 | 235,000 | 8.7% |
| New York City | 7.4M | 280,000 | 195,000 | 475,000 | 6.4% |
| Dallas-Fort Worth | 7.6M | 190,000 | 155,000 | 345,000 | 4.5% |
| Seattle | 4.0M | 115,000 | 105,000 | 220,000 | 5.5% |
| Miami-Fort Lauderdale | 6.2M | 95,000 | 75,000 | 170,000 | 2.7% |
| **TOTAL** | **41.1M** | **1,290,000** | **1,065,000** | **2,355,000** | **5.7%** |

This gives you 2.35M target audience across your five DMAs. Does this audience sizing feel realistic for your segments?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 12:
Excellent. Your 2.35M addressable audience gives strong reach potential - you need 15,000 test drives from 2.35M people, which is a 0.64% response rate. That's very achievable for luxury automotive with focused targeting.

Now let's move to budget allocation. You have $4M total. How do you want to split this between the two segments - 60/40 matching your sales targets, or would you weight differently for the acquisition phase?

Also, should we reserve any budget for testing and optimization, or deploy the full $4M from launch?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 13:
Smart approach. $3.6M active deployment with $400K optimization reserve gives you flexibility for a new brand launch.

Let me map the working budget:
- Luxury switchers: $2.16M (60% of $3.6M)  
- Eco-conscious early adopters: $1.44M (40% of $3.6M)
- Optimization reserve: $400K

This gives you $1,675 per luxury switcher sale and $1,029 per eco-conscious early adopter sale - both well under your $2,000 CAC target.

Now for value proposition. These segments need different messaging. Luxury switchers want premium tech positioning, while eco-conscious buyers need sustainability credibility. What's your core brand message that unifies both, and how do you differentiate the appeal for each segment?

Turn 14:
Excellent value proposition framework. "Advanced Performance, Responsible Innovation" creates a premium positioning that speaks to both segments while allowing distinct messaging paths.

The luxury switcher angle - technological leap beyond German sedans - directly addresses their upgrade mindset. The eco-conscious angle - comprehensive sustainability story - builds the credibility they need for their longer consideration cycle.

Now let's move to channels. With $3.6M across two distinct segments and five major DMAs, we need a channel mix that can handle both short-cycle luxury switchers and longer-cycle eco-conscious buyers.

Given your audience behaviors and geographic concentration, which channels do you think will be most effective for reaching these segments?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 15:
Strong channel strategy that matches your audience behaviors. Let me map your allocation to the $3.6M working budget:

- Digital Display: $1.44M (40%)
- Social (LinkedIn + others): $900K (25%) 
- Streaming Video: $540K (15%)
- Podcast: $360K (10%)
- Targeted Digital OOH: $360K (10%)

This mix handles both short-cycle luxury switchers and longer-cycle eco-conscious buyers well. LinkedIn and digital OOH hit luxury switchers with precision, while YouTube/streaming and podcasts support the educational content eco-conscious buyers need.

For measurement, you mentioned needing to track that critical 23% test drive conversion assumption closely. What measurement framework do you have in place to track the full funnel from impression to test drive to sale?

Turn 16:
Good measurement foundation. UTM tracking plus CRM integration gives you the conversion path visibility you need.

Given your 23% conversion rate assumption is unvalidated, I recommend setting up early warning triggers. If conversion drops below 18% in the first 30 days, that's a signal to investigate. Below 15% means immediate budget reallocation from acquisition to conversion optimization.

For testing, what's your plan for validating messaging and creative effectiveness across your two segments? The luxury switcher "technological leap" message versus eco-conscious "sustainability story" will need different creative approaches that should be tested early.

Turn 17:
Excellent testing framework. Three creative variations per segment with weekly reviews gives you rapid optimization capability. Testing all the way to test drive bookings, not just clicks, ensures you're optimizing for actual business outcomes.

Finally, let's address risks. I see several key vulnerabilities: your 23% conversion assumption, new brand credibility in a crowded EV market, and potential inventory/delivery challenges if campaigns perform better than expected.

What's your biggest concern about this plan, and what contingencies do you have if early performance signals suggest major adjustments are needed?

Turn 18:
Absolutely critical insight. Brand credibility risk in luxury automotive is make-or-break, especially for new entrants competing against established German brands.

Your agility plan is smart - rapid messaging pivots and dealer experience investment. I'd add one more safeguard: consider starting with smaller budget allocation in weeks 1-4 to validate customer experience before full deployment. Better to launch conservatively and scale up than risk early reputation damage.
