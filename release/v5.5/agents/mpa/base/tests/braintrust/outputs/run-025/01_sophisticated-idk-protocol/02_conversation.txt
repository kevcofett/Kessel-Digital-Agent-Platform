USER:
Hey, I'm the growth lead at QuickSend. We're a remittance fintech looking to acquire 10,000 new users this quarter with a $500K media spend. Let's build out the media strategy.

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start modeling your efficiency target. $500K ÷ 10,000 users = $50 per user acquisition. For remittance fintech, that's aggressive - typical CAC runs $75-150 based on industry benchmarks.

What specific business outcome are you targeting beyond user acquisition? Are you focused on transaction volume, active users, or revenue growth?

TURN 2 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're primarily focused on driving transaction volume and active user engagement. Right now, we want to expand our user base and get more people consistently using our platform for international money transfers. I know our $50 CAC target might be aggressive, but we're looking to disrupt the traditional remittance market with a more efficient acquisition strategy.

AGENT:
Perfect. Transaction volume and active engagement is your business outcome. At $50 CAC vs. typical $75-150, you're targeting 33-67% better efficiency - definitely aggressive but achievable with tight execution.

For remittance, success typically tracks monthly active users who transact, not just signups. What's your primary KPI for measuring success? Is it monthly active transacting users, total transaction volume, or average revenue per user?

TURN 3 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We're primarily looking at monthly active transacting users as our key metric. We want to build a sticky platform where users aren't just signing up, but actually moving money consistently. Total transaction volume is important too, but we see active user engagement as the leading indicator of long-term growth.

AGENT:
Excellent - monthly active transacting users is a strong KPI that connects acquisition to business value. 

To validate your $50 efficiency target, I need to understand your unit economics. What's your average transaction fee percentage, and roughly how many transactions does a typical active user complete per month?

This will help assess if $50 CAC generates positive unit economics within a reasonable payback period.

TURN 4 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I'm still working on solidifying our unit economics, to be honest. We know our average transaction fee is around 2-3%, but I don't have precise data on average monthly transactions per user yet. We're early in scaling and are still building out our detailed financial models. Can you help me benchmark what a healthy transaction frequency looks like in the remittance space?

AGENT:
Got it. I'll model using reasonable assumptions so we can move forward. For remittance platforms, active users typically complete 2-4 transactions monthly, with average transaction size around $300-500. At 2.5% fee (midpoint of your range), that's $15-50 monthly revenue per active user.

Using conservative estimates: $25 monthly revenue per user means $50 CAC pays back in 2 months - very healthy for fintech. You can refine these numbers anytime as your data improves.

Your economics look feasible if you can hit the $50 efficiency target. The challenge is execution - remittance users are often price-sensitive and have strong existing habits.

Ready to define your target audience to build a plan that can achieve this aggressive CAC?

TURN 5 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Those benchmarks sound promising. We know our core audience is likely first and second-generation immigrants who need reliable, cost-effective ways to send money back home. We're primarily looking at working professionals in major metro areas who have international connections - thinking places like New York, California, Texas where we have significant diaspora populations. Can we dig into demographic and psychographic profiles that would help us target more precisely?

AGENT:
Perfect foundation - diaspora communities in major metros is smart targeting. To hit your aggressive $50 CAC, we need precision beyond just demographics.

Let me map key targeting signals:

**Demographics**: 25-45 years old, household income $40K-80K, employed
**Geographic**: NYC, LA, SF, Houston, Dallas, Miami metro areas
**Behavioral**: Regular international communication, existing remittance usage, price-conscious financial decisions

For the psychographic precision you need, what specific countries or regions do your users primarily send money to? This dramatically affects targeting - someone sending to Mexico has different media consumption than someone sending to Philippines or Nigeria.

Also, are you targeting people already using competitors like Western Union, or trying to capture people new to formal remittance services?
