# Media Plan Output: Basic User - Steps 1-2 Completion

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What business outcome are you trying to achieve? Are you looking to get more customers, increase sales from existing customers, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect! Getting new customers is a clear objective. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success.

What number would tell you this campaign worked? For example, are you targeting a specific number of new customers, or a sales revenue goal?

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Let me update those numbers. $250,000 ÷ 1,800 customers = $139 per customer. That's still above typical shoe retail costs of $50-80.

Here's what I'm seeing: even at 1,800 customers, you'd need to be about 75% more efficient than average. That's possible but requires really tight targeting and the right channels.

Before we figure out how to get there, I need to understand your business better. What do customers typically spend when they buy from you?

Turn 6:
That's helpful! With 30-40% repeat customers, you're getting more value than just the first sale.

Let me model this: if 35% buy again at $100 (with $45 profit), that adds $16 in value ($45 × 0.35). So each new customer is worth about $61 total ($45 first purchase + $16 from repeats).

At $139 to acquire vs $61 in value, you'd still lose about $78 per customer. That gap is too big to work.

To make this profitable, you'd need to spend closer to $50 per customer. That would get you about 5,000 customers with your $250K budget - much better than your 1,800 target. Does 5,000 new customers sound realistic for your business?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Let me check those numbers. $250,000 ÷ 2,000 customers = $125 per customer to acquire. 

That's pretty aggressive for online shoe retail, where costs typically run $50-80 per customer. At $125, you'd need either a much higher budget (around $400K) or fewer customers (maybe 1,500-1,800) to hit realistic efficiency.

What's more important - staying at the $250K budget or hitting exactly 2,000 customers?

Turn 5:
Got it. For shoe retailers, profit margins typically run 40-50%. Let me model at 45% - so you'd make about $45 profit per $100 sale. You can adjust this anytime.

Here's what this means: if you spend $139 to get a customer who buys $100 worth of shoes, you'd lose $94 on that first purchase ($45 profit - $139 cost = -$94 loss).

Do your customers typically come back and buy more shoes over time, or is this mostly a one-time purchase business?

Turn 7:
Let me update that. $250,000 ÷ 3,000 customers = $83 per customer.

That's much better! At $83 cost vs your $61 customer value, you'd lose about $22 per customer. That's still a loss, but it's in the range where many growing companies invest to build their customer base.

This means you'd spend about $66,000 more than you'd make back immediately ($22 × 3,000). But you're building a base of 3,000 new customers who might buy more over time.

Does investing $66,000 to gain 3,000 new customers feel reasonable for growing your business?

Turn 8:
Perfect! So we have a solid foundation: $250,000 budget to acquire 3,000 new customers at $83 each. That's an investment in growth that makes sense for your business.

Now let's move to Step 3 and talk about your customers. To hit that $83 efficiency target, we need to be smart about who we're targeting.

Who is your ideal shoe customer? Think about age, gender, income level, or lifestyle - whatever describes the people who love buying your shoes.
