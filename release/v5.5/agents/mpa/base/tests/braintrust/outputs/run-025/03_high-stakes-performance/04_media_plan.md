# Media Plan Output: High-Stakes Performance Campaign

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start with your merchant acquisition goal. Let me immediately model your efficiency target: $2M ÷ 50,000 merchants = $40 per merchant acquisition cost. With $850 LTV, that's a 21x return - very strong unit economics.

For fintech merchant acquisition, typical CAC runs $60-120 based on industry benchmarks. Your $40 target is aggressive but achievable with tight targeting.

What's the primary business outcome you're driving with these 50,000 new merchants - is it transaction volume growth, market share expansion, or revenue targets?

Turn 3:
Perfect. Monthly processing volume added is your primary KPI, with 50,000 merchants as the volume target to drive that outcome.

Let me validate your economics: At $40 CAC with $850 LTV, you're targeting 4.7% of lifetime value for acquisition - extremely efficient. For payments platforms, this is aggressive but achievable given your strong unit economics.

One key question: Do you know your average monthly processing volume per merchant in that $10K-$100K range? This helps us model total volume impact and ensures our targeting attracts merchants who hit your processing targets, not just merchant count.

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Excellent - transaction volume growth through merchant network expansion is clear. Your $10K-$100K monthly processing sweet spot gives us solid targeting parameters.

Now I need to understand how you'll measure success. You mentioned MRR/ARR impact - what's your primary KPI? Is it:
- Number of merchants acquired (your 50,000 target)
- Monthly processing volume added
- Revenue growth from new merchants
- Or something else?

This determines how we structure measurement and optimization throughout the campaign.

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using $35K average monthly processing volume based on your estimate - you can refine anytime. Skewing toward the higher end makes sense for network value.

Let me check the math: 50,000 merchants × $35K = $1.75B in monthly processing volume added. That's substantial network growth.

For payments, assuming 2-3% transaction fees, that projects to $35-52M in annual revenue from these acquisitions. At $40 CAC versus $850 LTV, your efficiency target requires precision targeting to attract higher-volume merchants, not just any small business.

This is ambitious but achievable. To hit $40 CAC when market typically runs $60-120, we'll need tight audience definition focusing on businesses already processing meaningful volume.

Ready to move to audience targeting, or do you want to refine the volume assumptions first?

Turn 5:
Excellent. For $40 CAC in a $60-120 market, we need exceptional targeting precision. You're targeting businesses already processing meaningful volume - that's smart for efficiency.

Let's start with the most critical signal: How do we identify businesses already doing $15K+ monthly processing? Are we targeting:

- Businesses currently using competitors (Square, Stripe, etc.)
- Businesses showing growth signals (hiring, expansion, funding)
- Specific business types known for higher transaction volume
- Businesses expressing payment pain points
- Or other indicators?

This foundational targeting layer determines everything else. What's your strongest signal for identifying high-volume processors?

Turn 6:
Perfect - professional services, e-commerce, and hospitality with proven transaction activity. Online retailers and consulting firms are especially strong signals.

Now let's layer in behavioral targeting. Beyond business type, what signals indicate they're processing meaningful volume and potentially frustrated with current solutions? Are we targeting businesses that are:

- Actively researching payment solutions online
- Showing growth indicators (job postings, website traffic spikes)
- Engaging with competitor content or reviews
- Demonstrating specific pain points (chargebacks, international processing)

At $40 CAC, we need 15-20 targeting signals minimum. Which behavioral layers best identify your high-value prospects?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 7:
Excellent signals. Let me capture your audience framework:

**Core Verticals:** Professional services, e-commerce, hospitality
**High-Value Segments:** Online retailers, consulting firms
**Growth Signals:** Job postings (sales/ops/finance roles), website traffic growth, headcount expansion
**Transaction Complexity:** Multiple payment integrations, international processing needs
**Intent Signals:** Competitor review engagement, payment friction complaints

For consulting firms, international client bases are especially valuable - that suggests both volume and complexity that drives switching motivation.

Two quick refinements:
1. Company size parameters - are we targeting 10-50 employees, 25-100, or different ranges?
2. Geographic concentration - do these high-value prospects cluster in specific metros or regions?

These parameters help us size the addressable audience and assess if 50,000 merchants is realistic from this target pool.

Turn 8:
Perfect. 25-100 employees in major metros gives us strong targeting foundation. Let me model your audience reach:

**Primary Markets:** San Francisco, New York, Chicago, Austin
**Expansion Markets:** Denver, Atlanta, Boston

For 25-100 employee businesses in professional services, e-commerce, and hospitality across these 7 metros, we're looking at roughly 150,000-200,000 potential targets. With your behavioral filters (growth signals, payment complexity, competitor engagement), that narrows to approximately 40,000-60,000 highly qualified prospects.

Your 50,000 merchant goal represents 80-125% of the refined target universe - aggressive but achievable with strong creative and channel execution.

Ready to define geographic allocation, or do you want to adjust the metro selection or audience parameters first?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 9:
Perfect. Let's structure geographic allocation strategically with optimization flexibility.

For your $2M budget across 7 metros, I recommend this initial split:

**Primary Markets (70% = $1.4M):**
- San Francisco: 25% ($500K) - highest merchant density
- New York: 25% ($500K) - largest market opportunity  
- Chicago: 12% ($240K) - strong professional services
- Austin: 8% ($160K) - high growth market

**Expansion Markets (30% = $600K):**
- Denver, Atlanta, Boston: 10% each ($200K) - test and scale approach

This gives you meaningful investment in expansion markets while prioritizing proven territories. The 30% allocation to expansion markets provides real learning budget, not just token testing.

Does this geographic split align with your market priorities, or should we adjust the primary/expansion balance?
