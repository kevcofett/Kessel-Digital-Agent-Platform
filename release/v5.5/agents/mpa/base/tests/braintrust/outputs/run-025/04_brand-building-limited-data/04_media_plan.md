# Media Plan Output: Brand Building with Limited Data

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

For GreenLeaf's West Coast launch with brand awareness goals - what specific business outcome are you trying to achieve? Are you looking to drive trial purchases, build consideration for future sales, or establish market presence for a later conversion push?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your objective is establishing brand credibility and driving trial purchases among health-conscious millennials/Gen Z on the West Coast.

To measure success, what number will tell you this campaign worked? Are you tracking trial customers acquired, total awareness lift, or something else as your primary success metric?

Turn 3:
Excellent - 5,000 trial customers is a clear success metric. Let me check the economics. 

$500K budget ÷ 5,000 customers = $100 per trial customer. For natural supplements, typical acquisition costs run $40-80 based on industry benchmarks. At $100, you're targeting about 25% above the high end - this is aggressive but achievable with precise targeting.

To validate this works financially: what's the average order value for a trial purchase, and do you know your profit margin on supplement sales?

Turn 4:
Got it. Let me model using 55% margin (mid-point of your range). 

$49.99 × 55% = $27.50 profit per trial customer. But you're spending $100 to acquire each one, creating a $72.50 loss per customer on first purchase.

For supplements, this makes sense IF customers repurchase. Typical supplement LTV runs 2-4x first purchase when retention works. At 3x, your customer would be worth $150 lifetime vs $100 acquisition cost.

This is a reasonable brand-building investment, but success depends on converting trial customers to repeat buyers. Does that math align with your expectations for this launch strategy?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 5:
Perfect. Your economics work with repeat purchase conversion - $100 acquisition targeting $150+ lifetime value. This is a solid brand-building investment if retention executes well.

Now let's define your audience precisely. You mentioned health-conscious millennials and Gen Z. With your aggressive $100 CAC target, we need tight targeting.

Starting with demographics: what age range specifically? Millennials span 28-43 and Gen Z spans 18-27, so are you targeting the full 18-43 range or focusing on a narrower segment within that?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 7:
Perfect targeting profile. Health-conscious professionals 25-40 who shop premium natural retailers, follow wellness influencers, use health tracking apps, and practice yoga/meditation. This gives us strong behavioral and interest signals.

For the West Coast launch - California, Oregon, and Washington - do you want to focus on specific metro areas like LA, SF, Seattle, Portland, or target the entire states? 

Metro targeting would be more precise but smaller reach, while state-wide gives broader awareness but less efficiency. Given your $100 CAC target, which approach fits your strategy better?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Excellent - 25-40 health-conscious professionals with wellness focus gives us a strong foundation.

To hit your aggressive $100 CAC target, we need additional targeting precision. Beyond age and health-consciousness, what other signals help identify your ideal customer? 

For example: Do they follow specific wellness influencers, shop at certain retailers like Whole Foods, engage with fitness content, use wellness apps, or have other behaviors that signal they're your target buyer?

Turn 9:
Perfect. Your $500K budget allocation across four metros creates these efficiency targets per market:

**Budget Allocation:**
- LA: $200K for 2,000 customers = $100 CAC
- SF Bay: $125K for 1,250 customers = $100 CAC  
- Seattle: $125K for 1,250 customers = $100 CAC
- Portland: $50K for 500 customers = $100 CAC

This maintains your $100 CAC target across all markets while scaling volume proportionally.

Now let's craft your value proposition. For health-conscious millennials who see supplements as part of holistic wellness - what makes GreenLeaf different from other natural supplement brands? What's your unique positioning in this crowded market?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Smart choice. SF, LA, Seattle, and Portland are wellness-forward metros with dense concentrations of your 25-40 health-conscious demographic. This metro focus supports your aggressive $100 CAC target through precise geographic efficiency.

Let me assess your budget allocation. Four major metros with $500K total budget. Based on population and market size, a typical split might be:
- LA: 40% ($200K) 
- SF Bay: 25% ($125K)
- Seattle: 25% ($125K)
- Portland: 10% ($50K)

Does this allocation align with your market priorities, or do you want to weight certain metros differently based on your business strategy?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Excellent positioning. "Intelligent wellness backed by science" differentiates you from both mass market supplements and trendy wellness brands making unsupported claims.

Your value proposition hits three key points: transparency through detailed sourcing info, credibility via clinical research partnerships, and sustainability that aligns with your audience's values. This resonates perfectly with educated professionals who want evidence-based wellness choices.

Now we're ready for channels. With your $500K budget, 25-40 health-conscious metro audience, and science-backed positioning - I'm thinking a mix of social platforms where wellness conversations happen, plus search to capture intent.

What channels are you most interested in exploring? Have you had any early thoughts about where your audience discovers new wellness brands?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Strong channel instincts. Instagram and TikTok align perfectly with your wellness influencer audience, and podcast advertising is smart for your science-backed positioning - longer format lets you explain research credibility.

Let me model a strategic mix:
- **Instagram/TikTok (60% - $300K):** Primary awareness and trial driver
- **Wellness Podcasts (25% - $125K):** Credibility building with detailed messaging  
- **Google Search (15% - $75K):** Capture intent from awareness activities

This prioritizes social discovery while podcasts build trust and search captures demand. Instagram/TikTok CPMs run $8-15, podcast CPMs $20-40, search CPCs $2-8 for supplements.

Does this allocation feel right, or would you adjust the mix based on where you think your audience discovers brands?
