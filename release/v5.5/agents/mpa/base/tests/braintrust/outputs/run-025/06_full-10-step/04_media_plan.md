# Media Plan Output: Full 10-Step Media Planning

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with the math on your targets. $750K ÷ 15,000 customers = $50 per customer. For home decor/furniture, typical acquisition costs run $60-100, so you're targeting about 17-40% better efficiency than market benchmarks. This is aggressive but achievable with tight execution.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 15,000 new customers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your objective is market share expansion through customer base growth, with revenue growth as the primary outcome. 

Now I need to understand how you'll measure success. What's the main number you'll track to know if this campaign worked? For example, is it total revenue from these 15,000 customers, or something else like customer lifetime value?

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using 35% margin which is reasonable for home decor. You can refine anytime.

Here's the reality check: At 35% margin on $150-300 products, you're making $52-105 per sale. Your $50 acquisition cost leaves $2-55 profit per customer on first purchase. That's tight but workable, especially since you mentioned repeat purchases.

For context, aggressive acquisition strategies in home decor typically target 15-25% below benchmark CAC. You're targeting 17-40% below, which puts you at the aggressive end but not impossible.

To hit $50 per customer when market shows $60-100, you'll need:
- Tight audience targeting (likely 15-25 targeting signals)
- Strong creative that drives immediate action
- Efficient channel selection

Your willingness to be aggressive on initial acquisition makes sense for market share goals, especially with repeat purchase upside.

Economics look feasible with disciplined execution. Ready to move to audience definition?

Turn 5:
Perfect. You're right that precision will be critical for $50 efficiency. Let's build a detailed audience profile.

Starting with your homeowners aged 30-55 interested in modern, affordable decor - that's a good foundation. Now let's layer in behavioral signals.

What specific behaviors or life events typically trigger someone to buy home decor and furniture? For example, are your best customers moving, renovating, getting married, buying their first home, or something else?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Excellent. So your primary KPI is total revenue from new customers, targeting $2-3 million in first-year revenue from 15,000 customers.

Let me check the math: $2-3M ÷ 15,000 = $133-200 average order value per new customer. That's solid for home decor.

With your $50 acquisition cost target and $133-200 customer value, you're looking at 2.7x to 4x return on acquisition spend. That's healthy economics if achievable.

Quick feasibility check: To hit $50 per customer in home decor, you'll need precise audience targeting and efficient channel mix. Market typically shows $60-100, so this requires about 20-40% better performance than average.

Do you have data on your current profit margins or what you can afford to spend per customer while staying profitable?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent insights. Life transitions are high-intent moments with strong purchase urgency - perfect for efficient acquisition.

Let me build on that: new homeowners, newlyweds, and relocating professionals in urban/suburban areas, budget-conscious but aesthetics-focused.

What about their media consumption and shopping behaviors? For example, where do they typically discover home decor inspiration - Pinterest, Instagram, home improvement shows, design blogs? And do they tend to research extensively before buying, or are they more impulse purchasers when they find something they like?

Turn 7:
Perfect - visual discovery platforms with high research intent but impulse potential. That's valuable targeting intel.

Let me add one more layer: What about their spending patterns and lifestyle signals? For example, do they shop frequently at places like Target, West Elm, or IKEA? Are they likely to have certain subscriptions, follow specific lifestyle brands, or engage with particular types of content beyond home decor?

This will help us identify lookalike signals and refine targeting to hit your $50 efficiency target.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Perfect. National reach with 60-70% concentration in proven metros - smart approach for efficiency.

Let me model that allocation: 60-70% of $750K = $450-525K for top metros, leaving $225-300K for broader national reach. Those metros have higher CPMs but better audience density, which should help hit your $50 efficiency target.

Your audience definition is solid: life-transition moments (new homes, marriage, relocation), urban/suburban professionals 30-55, Pinterest/Instagram discovery, Target/IKEA shopping patterns, DTC brand affinity, concentrated in major metros.

Ready to move to budget allocation? We'll determine how to split your $750K between audience segments and geographies to maximize that 15,000 customer target.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
Excellent. That's a rich behavioral profile - Target/IKEA shoppers, streaming subscribers, design influencer followers, urban lifestyle content consumers. The crossover with brands like Casper and Warby Parker shows direct-to-consumer affinity.

Now let's get geographic. You mentioned urban and suburban areas - are you targeting nationally, or focusing on specific regions, cities, or DMAs? And are there particular markets where you see stronger performance or plan to concentrate spend?

Turn 10:
I appreciate your eagerness to discuss channels - that's where the execution gets exciting. We'll build your channel strategy in Step 7 once we have your budget allocation and value proposition locked down. The right channels depend on how we split budget between metros and segments.

Let's first determine your budget allocation. You mentioned 60-70% to top metros. Within that concentration, do you want to allocate evenly across New York, San Francisco, Chicago, and Atlanta, or weight toward specific markets based on performance or opportunity?

Turn 11:
Perfect allocation strategy. Let me model that:

**Metro Budget (65% of $750K = $487K):**
- NY/SF (45%): $219K
- Chicago/Atlanta (20%): $98K
- Other metros: $170K

**National reach: $263K (35%)**

At your $50 target efficiency:
- NY/SF: 4,380 customers
- Chicago/Atlanta: 1,960 customers  
- Other metros: 3,400 customers
- National: 5,260 customers
- **Total: 15,000 customers**

This weighting makes sense - coastal markets have higher audience density for your demographic, justifying the concentration despite higher CPMs.

Now let's define your value proposition. What's your key differentiator when competing against Target, IKEA, West Elm, and other players for these design-conscious but budget-aware customers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 12:
Excellent positioning - the "attainable aspiration" sweet spot between mass market and premium design. That's a compelling value proposition for your budget-conscious but aesthetics-focused audience.

Your messaging framework is clear: curated modern design that's accessible, higher quality than mass market but more affordable than premium. The lifestyle angle resonates perfectly with your Pinterest/Instagram discovery audience.

This positioning should work well across your channel mix when we get there. Ready to move to channels? We'll determine the optimal media mix to reach your life-transition audience across those metro markets and deliver your 15,000 customers at $50 efficiency.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 13:
Perfect approach - native-feeling content that fits natural discovery patterns will be key for your $50 efficiency target.

Based on your audience profile, here's your optimal channel mix:

**Meta (40% = $300K):** Instagram/Facebook for visual discovery. Your Pinterest-browsing, design-conscious audience lives here. Strong lookalike targeting using your Target/IKEA shopper signals.

**Pinterest (20% = $150K):** Direct targeting of home decor searches and lifestyle boards. High-intent discovery platform where your audience actively seeks inspiration.

**Google (25% = $187K):** Search for life-transition keywords ("new apartment furniture," "first home decor") and shopping campaigns for product discovery.

**Programmatic Display (10% = $75K):** Retargeting across design blogs, Apartment Therapy, lifestyle sites where your audience researches.

**TikTok (5% = $37K):** Test budget for design inspiration content targeting younger end of your 30-55 range.

This mix prioritizes visual platforms where your audience naturally discovers design inspiration. The 65/35 split between social-visual channels and search-display aligns with research-then-impulse buying behavior.

Does this channel allocation feel right for your brand and audience?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 10: Risks

Turn 14:
Excellent! Your channel mix is locked: heavy visual discovery (Meta/Pinterest 60%), search intent capture (Google 25%), research retargeting (Programmatic 10%), and trend testing (TikTok 5%).

Now let's establish measurement. Beyond your primary KPI of total revenue from new customers, what specific metrics will you track to optimize toward your $50 acquisition cost and monitor campaign health?

For example, will you track platform-specific metrics like cost per acquisition by channel, or focus on blended performance across the mix?

Turn 15:
Perfect measurement approach. Granular channel tracking with budget flexibility is essential for hitting your $50 target.

**Key Metrics Framework:**
- **Primary:** CPA by channel (target $50 across all)
- **Secondary:** ROAS by channel, conversion rate from engagement to purchase
- **Optimization:** Weekly budget reallocation based on CPA performance

**Attribution Setup:** First-touch and last-touch tracking to understand discovery vs. conversion roles. Meta/Pinterest likely drive discovery, Google captures intent.

**Performance Thresholds:** 
- Channels hitting <$45 CPA: increase budget
- Channels at $50-55 CPA: maintain 
- Channels >$60 CPA: reduce or optimize creative

**Reporting Cadence:** Weekly channel performance reviews with monthly reallocation decisions.

This gives you the agility to shift that $750K toward your best-performing channels quickly.

Ready for Step 9 - testing strategy? We'll outline how to validate your creative approach and optimize toward that aggressive $50 efficiency target.
