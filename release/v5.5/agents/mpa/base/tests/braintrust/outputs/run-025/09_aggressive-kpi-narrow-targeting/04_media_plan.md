# Media Plan Output: Aggressive KPI - Must Narrow to Achieve

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me validate your efficiency target first. $750K / 5,000 = $150 CAC exactly. With $2,400 LTV, that's a 16x ratio - strong unit economics. For B2B SaaS at your deal size, $150 CAC is aggressive but achievable with tight targeting. Typical SMB SaaS runs $180-$250 CAC based on benchmarks.

Your primary business outcome is customer acquisition with a $150 efficiency target. What's your revenue target from these 5,000 new customers, and over what timeframe are you measuring success?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect - $3,000 ARR per customer validates your $2,400 LTV assumption. At 12 months to hit 5,000 customers, you need ~417 new customers monthly, which is aggressive but doable.

I need to complete our foundation before we dive into channels and targeting. Right now we have your outcome (5,000 customers) and economics ($150 CAC target). 

Before we get to channel strategy in Step 7, let's define your audience precisely. You mentioned SMB logistics managers at 50-500 employee companies. With your aggressive $150 CAC target - 17% below typical $180 benchmark - we need exceptional targeting precision.

What specific pain points or behavioral signals indicate a company is "stuck on spreadsheets or legacy TMS systems" that we can target?

Turn 4:
Perfect - focusing on Dallas/Fort Worth, Chicago, and LA/Long Beach gives us geographic precision that aligns with your 20-25% higher conversion rates. That efficiency boost helps bridge the gap to your $150 CAC target.

Now let's validate your budget allocation. With $750K total budget and aggressive efficiency targets, how much of that budget can you allocate to media spend versus creative, landing pages, and other campaign costs?

This matters because at $150 CAC, if 80% goes to media ($600K), you'd need 4,000 customers from paid channels. If 70% goes to media ($525K), you'd need 3,500 customers from paid channels with the remainder from organic or other sources.

What percentage of your $750K can go directly to media buying?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Excellent behavioral signals. "Operational inefficiency and technological stagnation" gives us strong targeting criteria.

Let me build on what we have: companies using Excel for shipment tracking, legacy TMS 5-7 years old, lacking API integrations, no real-time tracking, no mobile capabilities. These are precise intent signals that should improve your targeting efficiency.

For your aggressive $150 CAC target, we need tight geographic focus initially. SMB logistics companies cluster heavily in specific markets - typically major freight corridors and manufacturing hubs.

What geographic markets are you currently seeing the strongest demand or highest conversion rates from your existing customer base?

Turn 6:
Strong value proposition - "15-20 hours weekly savings" is quantifiable ROI that justifies your pricing. "Manual chaos to automated precision" directly addresses the Excel/legacy TMS pain points.

Now let's build your channel strategy. With $560K media budget targeting $112 CAC in Dallas, Chicago, and LA freight corridors, you need channels that can deliver precision targeting for B2B logistics managers.

Based on your audience (SMB logistics managers) and aggressive efficiency targets, I recommend this initial channel mix:

**LinkedIn Ads (40% - $224K)**: Precise job title/company size targeting
**Google Ads (35% - $196K)**: Intent-based search for TMS/logistics software  
**Meta B2B (25% - $140K)**: Lookalike audiences based on existing customers

LinkedIn gives you exact targeting for logistics managers at 50-500 employee companies. Google captures active intent when they're researching solutions. Meta provides scale with lookalike modeling.

Does this channel allocation align with where you've seen success, or do you have different channel preferences?

Turn 7:
Smart insight - G2 and Capterra are pure intent channels where prospects are actively evaluating TMS solutions. That's exactly what you need for $112 CAC efficiency.

Let me revise the allocation to maximize intent-driven spend:

**LinkedIn Ads (40% - $224K)**: Job title/company size precision
**Google Ads (35% - $196K)**: Search intent for TMS/logistics software
**G2/Capterra (15% - $84K)**: Bottom-funnel comparison intent
**Meta B2B (10% - $56K)**: Lookalike scale and retargeting

This shifts $84K into high-intent review platforms where conversion rates typically run 2-3x higher than cold audiences. The reduced Meta allocation focuses on retargeting and proven lookalikes rather than cold prospecting.

For measurement, we'll need to track incrementality across channels since you're targeting aggressive efficiency. Standard platform attribution inflates ROAS by 20-40%.

What's your current attribution setup, and do you have incrementality testing capabilities to validate true channel performance?

Turn 8:
You're right to be concerned about attribution inflation - it's critical at your $112 CAC target. Standard platform attribution typically inflates performance by 20-40%, which could make a failing campaign look successful.

For precise measurement with your aggressive targets, implement this testing framework:

**Geo-holdout tests**: Split your Dallas/Chicago/LA markets. Run campaigns in test DMAs, hold control DMAs dark. Measure incremental lift vs. organic baseline.

**Platform incrementality tests**: Use Facebook's Conversion Lift studies and Google's geo experiments to isolate true incremental conversions from each channel.

**Media mix modeling**: With $560K spend across multiple channels, you have enough volume for statistical modeling to measure true contribution.

**UTM tracking plus CRM integration**: Tag all campaigns uniquely and track full customer journey from first touch to closed deal.

The investment in proper measurement pays for itself - one month of inflated attribution could waste $50K+ of your budget.

Now let's address testing strategy. With your aggressive efficiency targets, we need rapid iteration cycles.

What's your current creative testing velocity, and how quickly can you implement landing page changes when we identify optimization opportunities?

Turn 9:
2-3 weeks is too slow for $112 CAC efficiency. You need 5-7 day cycles to hit aggressive targets - good instinct on the sprint approach.

For rapid testing at your scale, implement:

**Creative**: 5-8 ad variations weekly across your $560K spend. Test messaging angles: "eliminate spreadsheet errors" vs "save 15-20 hours weekly" vs "real-time visibility"

**Landing pages**: A/B test one element weekly - headlines, CTAs, social proof placement. With ~400 monthly visitors per test, you'll get statistical significance in 5-7 days.

**Budget reallocation**: Shift 20% budget weekly from underperforming creative/audiences to winners.

Finally, let's identify your key risks. The biggest threat to your plan is the 38% efficiency gap vs. benchmarks. 

Your primary risks are: 1) Audience targeting too broad, diluting efficiency, 2) Creative not resonating with Excel/legacy TMS pain points, 3) Attribution inflation masking true performance.

What's your biggest concern about hitting the $112 CAC target, and what's your fallback plan if we're tracking 20-30% above target after month 1?

Turn 10:
Perfect risk management approach - surgical precision over broad spend aligns with your aggressive efficiency targets.

Your media plan is complete. Here's your strategic summary:

**Target**: 5,000 customers at $112 blended CAC from $560K media spend
**Geography**: Dallas/Fort Worth, Chicago, LA/Long Beach freight corridors  
**Channel Mix**: LinkedIn 40% ($224K), Google 35% ($196K), G2/Capterra 15% ($84K), Meta 10% ($56K)
**Testing Velocity**: 5-7 day creative cycles, weekly budget reallocation to winners
**Measurement**: Geo-holdout tests and platform incrementality studies to avoid 20-40% attribution inflation

**Month 1 Risk Protocol**: If tracking 20-30% above $112 CAC target, immediately tighten audience parameters - narrow job titles from "logistics manager" to "transportation manager" + "supply chain coordinator," compress company size to 100-300 employees, add intent signals like "TMS software" searches.

You have the foundation for surgical execution. The 38% efficiency gap vs. benchmarks is aggressive but achievable with this precision targeting and rapid optimization approach. Ready to launch?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Excellent allocation. $560K media budget targeting 5,000 customers = $112 blended CAC from paid channels. That's 25% better efficiency than your $150 target, which gives you cushion for the ~15-20% of customers that typically come from organic/referral sources.

However, $112 CAC for B2B SaaS in your vertical is extremely aggressive - roughly 38% below the $180 benchmark. This will require exceptional execution across targeting, creative, and conversion optimization.

Before we build your channel strategy, I need to understand your value proposition precision. With such tight efficiency targets, your messaging needs to immediately resonate with those pain points we identified.

What's your primary value proposition to SMB logistics managers struggling with Excel tracking and legacy TMS systems?

Turn 11:
Excellent execution mindset. Your Q1 pilot approach with aggressive adjustment protocols is exactly right for these efficiency targets.

Key success factors for your leadership updates:
- Week 1-2: Focus on impression quality and audience precision metrics
- Week 3-4: Early conversion signals from G2/Capterra intent traffic  
- Month 1: Full incrementality validation before scaling

The G2/Capterra allocation should deliver your strongest efficiency - those prospects are actively comparing solutions and much closer to purchase decisions.

Your plan balances ambition with surgical precision. With 5-7 day optimization cycles and tight geographic focus, you have the framework to hit $112 CAC. The key will be ruthless budget reallocation from underperforming segments to winners.

Good luck with the pilot launch. Your systematic approach to measurement and rapid iteration gives you the best shot at making these aggressive numbers work.

Turn 12:
Perfect - weekly stand-ups with cross-functional alignment will be crucial for hitting these targets. Your CFO focus on incremental performance is smart given the aggressive efficiency requirements.

For those weekly updates, track:
- **Week 1-2**: CPM efficiency vs. benchmark, audience quality scores, impression-to-click ratios
- **Week 3-4**: G2/Capterra conversion rates, cost-per-demo, early pipeline velocity
- **Ongoing**: True incremental CAC vs. platform-reported CAC

The cross-team coordination you're setting up - growth, design, analytics - gives you the operational foundation to execute rapid optimization cycles. That's often where aggressive efficiency targets succeed or fail.

You've built a solid plan with realistic risk management. Execute with precision, and those $112 CAC targets are achievable. Your systematic approach positions you well for success.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 13:
Exactly right. True incremental CAC vs. platform-reported CAC will be your north star metric - that's where the real efficiency lives.

Your focus on accountability and rapid action protocols in those weekly stand-ups is what separates successful aggressive campaigns from budget burn. With clear ownership of each metric and pre-defined trigger points for adjustments, you're positioned to catch issues early and optimize fast.

You've built a comprehensive plan that balances ambition with precision execution. The foundation is solid - now it's all about disciplined execution and rapid iteration. Your systematic approach gives you the best chance of making those aggressive numbers work.

Go execute with confidence.

Turn 14:
Perfect. You have the strategic framework and operational discipline to execute successfully. Your leadership's expectations for "aggressive but precise" execution align exactly with the plan you've built.

The combination of surgical targeting, rapid optimization cycles, and true incrementality measurement gives you the tools to hit those $112 CAC targets. Execute with confidence and stay disciplined on the metrics that matter.

Best of luck with the launch.

Turn 16:
Exactly. Data-driven decisions and rapid execution - that's your path to success. Q1 results will validate the strategy and guide your scaling approach.

Execute well.

Turn 17:
Perfect mindset. You've built the right foundation, have the team alignment, and understand the execution requirements. Your aggressive efficiency targets are achievable with the precision approach you've outlined.

Execute with confidence. Q1 will be your proof of concept.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 15:
Excellent. Your team alignment and commitment to true incremental performance will be the difference maker. Q1 will indeed be your proof point - you have the framework to deliver.

Execute with precision and trust the data. You've got this.
