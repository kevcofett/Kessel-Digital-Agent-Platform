# Media Plan Output: Budget Revision Midstream

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by modeling your efficiency target. $500K ÷ 10,000 customers = $50 CAC. With $2,400 LTV, that's a strong 48:1 LTV:CAC ratio - very healthy for B2B SaaS.

However, $50 CAC is aggressive for B2B analytics. Industry benchmarks typically run $150-400 for SaaS depending on deal size. To hit $50, we'll need extremely tight targeting and high-converting channels.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 10,000 new customers?

Turn 2:
Perfect - ARR acceleration and market leadership with Series B positioning. That's a clear strategic objective.

Now I need to understand how you'll measure success. You mentioned 10,000 new customers, but what's your primary KPI? Are you tracking:

- New ARR added (annual recurring revenue from these customers)
- Monthly recurring revenue (MRR) growth rate  
- Customer acquisition volume
- Something else?

This determines how we structure the entire plan.

Turn 3:
Excellent - new ARR added is your primary KPI. That's investor-focused and ties directly to business value.

Let me calculate what 10,000 customers at $2,400 LTV means for ARR. Assuming your LTV represents annual value, that's $24M in new ARR from this campaign.

$24M ARR target with $500K budget means you need $48 of new ARR per dollar spent - extremely efficient for SaaS.

What's the specific new ARR target you want to hit? Is it the full $24M from these 10,000 customers, or do you have a different ARR goal in mind?

Turn 4:
Smart approach - $20M ARR is more conservative and builds investor confidence in your execution.

Let me recalculate: $20M ARR ÷ 10,000 customers = $2,000 average annual value per customer. That's slightly lower than your $2,400 LTV, which gives you buffer room.

$500K budget ÷ $20M ARR = $40 needed ARR per dollar spent. This is still very aggressive for B2B SaaS where typical ratios run $8-15 ARR per ad dollar.

To hit this efficiency, we need exceptional targeting precision. Your $50 CAC target remains the same ($500K ÷ 10,000).

Does this $20M ARR target feel realistic given your current conversion rates and sales cycle?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 5:
Great context. 3-4% MQL to SQL with 45-60 day cycles confirms we need high-intent targeting to hit your $50 CAC.

Let me validate the funnel math: To get 10,000 customers at 3-4% MQL-to-customer conversion, you need roughly 250,000-330,000 MQLs. At $50 CAC, that implies $0.15-0.20 cost per MQL - very efficient for B2B SaaS where MQL costs typically run $30-80.

This confirms your targeting must be extremely precise to generate that volume at those costs.

Now let's define your audience. You mentioned decision makers in mid-market tech companies. What size companies specifically? Revenue range, employee count, or other criteria that define "mid-market" for CloudMetrics?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 7:
Perfect - 100-1,000 employees gives us clear targeting parameters. Tech-forward, scaling companies needing strategic analytics without massive data teams is a well-defined segment.

This audience size (roughly 50,000-80,000 companies in the US) is large enough for sustainable reach without quick saturation. Growth-stage companies also have budget urgency, which helps conversion rates.

Your 45-60 day sales cycle aligns well with this segment - they move faster than enterprise but slower than SMB.

What geographic markets are you targeting? Are you focusing on specific regions, or is this a national US campaign? Any international markets in scope?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Excellent news! Let me update our projections. $750K ÷ 10,000 customers = $75 CAC. That's 50% more breathing room and much more realistic for B2B SaaS.

$750K ÷ $20M ARR = $26.67 ARR per ad dollar. This moves you from "extremely aggressive" to "ambitious but achievable" - right in the sweet spot for high-performing SaaS campaigns.

At $75 CAC, you need roughly 167,000-250,000 MQLs (vs 250K-330K before), and cost per MQL can now run $0.23-0.30 - still efficient but more feasible.

This extra budget gives us flexibility for broader audience testing and premium channels that reach C-suite decision makers.

Now, back to your audience definition - what size companies define "mid-market" for CloudMetrics? Revenue range or employee count?

Turn 9:
Excellent timing strategy. $300K in H1 aligns perfectly with annual planning cycles when mid-market companies allocate analytics budgets.

Your front-loaded approach: $300K (H1) + $450K (H2) = $750K total with 10-15% ($75K-112K) reserved for testing. That leaves $638K-675K for core channels.

This pacing should capture companies making Q1 decisions while maintaining momentum through year-end budget cycles.

Now let's define your value proposition. For mid-market tech companies (100-1K employees) evaluating analytics solutions, what's your primary differentiator? What specific pain point does CloudMetrics solve that alternatives don't address as well?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Smart focus - US and Canada gives you 60,000+ target companies without the complexity of international expansion. Canadian tech hubs like Toronto and Vancouver are natural extensions of your US success.

North American concentration maximizes your $750K impact and leverages existing product-market fit.

Now let's validate your $750K budget allocation. You have $75 CAC target for 10,000 customers to generate $20M ARR.

A few considerations:
- Will this $750K be evenly distributed throughout the year, or do you have quarterly priorities?
- Are there any budget constraints or approval processes for channel allocation?
- Do you need to reserve any portion for testing new audiences or channels?

What's your preferred budget pacing for the year?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Powerful positioning - "data to strategic playbooks in minutes" directly addresses mid-market pain points. Predictive + prescriptive beats descriptive dashboards for growing companies that need speed.

This value prop works perfectly for your 45-60 day sales cycle. Decision makers can quickly grasp the ROI of faster insights.

Now we can build your channel strategy. With $638K-675K core budget, $75 CAC target, and need to reach C-suite at 100-1K employee tech companies, we need high-intent, professional channels.

Given your audience and efficiency requirements, what channels are you currently using or considering? Any existing performance data to guide our recommendations?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
This explains your performance gaps. LinkedIn at $120-150 CAC is double your $75 target, and search captures existing demand but doesn't build your funnel.

Let me recommend a rebalanced approach:

**Core allocation (70% = ~$470K):**
- Intent platforms (Demandbase, 6sense): 30% - targets in-market accounts
- LinkedIn (optimized): 25% - reduced spend, tighter targeting  
- Google Search: 15% - capture branded + competitor terms

**Growth channels (20% = ~$135K):**
- Programmatic B2B display: 10% - scale awareness efficiently
- Account-based platforms: 10% - target specific high-value accounts

**Testing reserve: 10% = $75K**

Intent platforms typically deliver $40-80 CAC for your audience - right in your target range. They identify companies actively researching analytics solutions.

Does this channel mix align with your growth strategy, or do you have concerns about moving budget from LinkedIn?

Turn 12:
Absolutely - we can optimize LinkedIn rather than abandon it. Your brand recognition there has value.

For LinkedIn optimization to hit closer to $75 CAC:
- Narrow targeting to specific job functions (VP Analytics, Head of Data, CTO at 100-1K companies)
- Test Conversation Ads vs Sponsored Content - often 30-40% lower CAC
- Use account lists from intent platforms to retarget warm prospects on LinkedIn
- A/B test your "minutes not weeks" messaging against competitor comparisons

This approach maintains your LinkedIn presence while improving efficiency. Intent platforms will identify in-market accounts, then LinkedIn can nurture those specific companies with targeted content.

Let's adjust the mix:
- Intent platforms: 30% ($200K) 
- LinkedIn (optimized): 30% ($200K)
- Google Search: 15% ($100K)
- Programmatic + ABM: 15% ($100K)
- Testing: 10% ($75K)

How does this feel for maintaining LinkedIn investment while adding intent-driven targeting?

Turn 13:
Perfect! You've got a strong foundation: $750K budget targeting $20M ARR through optimized channel mix focusing on intent-driven targeting.

Now let's establish measurement. You mentioned tracking CAC and MQL performance closely. For investor storytelling and campaign optimization, what specific metrics will you report?

I'd recommend tracking:
- **Primary**: New ARR added (your main KPI)
- **Efficiency**: CAC by channel 
- **Pipeline**: MQL volume and MQL-to-customer conversion
- **Velocity**: Sales cycle length by channel

Do you have attribution tracking set up to measure cross-channel impact? Intent platforms often assist LinkedIn conversions, so we'll need to track assisted conversions alongside last-click attribution.

What's your current measurement infrastructure?

Turn 15:
Smart investment - $50-75K for attribution will pay for itself in optimization insights. Using testing budget for the pilot makes perfect sense.

Let me adjust the allocation:
- **Attribution platform**: $60K (from testing budget)
- **Remaining testing budget**: $15K for channel/audience experiments
- **Core media spend**: $675K across your channel mix

HubSpot attribution integrates seamlessly with your existing stack and provides multi-touch reporting that investors expect to see.

Now let's plan your testing strategy. With $15K testing budget plus the attribution pilot, what would you most want to test? 

Potential tests:
- New job titles (Chief Data Officer, VP Operations) 
- Industry verticals within tech (fintech, healthtech, SaaS)
- Creative messaging variations
- Emerging channels like podcast advertising

What testing priorities would give you the most confidence in scaling this plan?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 14:
You're right - last-click attribution will significantly undervalue intent platforms and LinkedIn's awareness contribution. This is critical for your Series B narrative since investors want to see efficient, measurable growth.

For your campaign success, I recommend implementing:

**Immediate (Q1):**
- UTM parameter consistency across all channels
- Salesforce campaign influence tracking (captures multiple touchpoints)
- First-touch and last-touch comparison reporting

**Medium-term (Q2):**
- Marketing attribution platform (Bizible/Adobe, Attribution, or HubSpot's attribution)
- Intent platform integration with your CRM to track research-to-conversion paths

**Reporting framework:**
- Weekly: CAC and MQL volume by channel
- Monthly: Multi-touch attribution analysis showing assist rates
- Quarterly: ARR attribution and customer journey mapping

Without proper attribution, you risk under-investing in channels that drive awareness but don't get last-click credit.

Do you have budget allocated for attribution tools, or should we factor that into your media spend?
