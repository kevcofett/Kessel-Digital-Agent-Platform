# Media Plan Output: Budget Decrease Midstream

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start with your business outcome. You mentioned needing 500 qualified opportunities - is your primary objective lead generation to feed your sales pipeline, or are you looking to achieve a specific revenue target from those opportunities?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So revenue generation through qualified pipeline is your objective, with 500 SQLs targeting $75M potential pipeline at $150K average deal size.

For your primary KPI - how do you measure success as a number? Are you tracking SQL count, pipeline value generated, or something else as your main success metric?

Turn 4:
Let me validate those economics. 500 SQLs × 22.5% conversion = 112 deals × $150K = $16.8M revenue. At $1M spend, that's 16.8x ROAS - excellent unit economics.

Your $2,000 cost per SQL is aggressive for enterprise data infrastructure. Based on industry benchmarks, enterprise B2B SQLs typically run $3,000-$5,000. To hit $2,000, you'll need highly efficient targeting and likely a multi-channel approach mixing lower-funnel tactics with brand awareness.

The good news: your strong conversion rate (22.5%) means you can afford higher acquisition costs than competitors. This plan is feasible but requires precision targeting.

Ready to define your audience? We need to get very specific about those data and IT leaders within 5000+ employee companies.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 5:
Good foundation - VP/Director-level data infrastructure and IT leaders focused on scalability, performance, and integration. That's your demographic and need-state.

To build targeting that can hit your aggressive $2,000 SQL cost, I need the behavioral and contextual signals:

**Behavioral**: What triggers these leaders to evaluate new data infrastructure? Is it data growth hitting limits, migration projects, compliance requirements, or performance issues with current systems?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent. So your primary KPI is $75M in qualified pipeline value from 500 SQLs at $150K average deal size.

Now for the economics. With your $1M budget targeting $75M pipeline, that's $1.33 per dollar of pipeline generated. However, what really matters is cost per SQL. $1M ÷ 500 SQLs = $2,000 cost per SQL.

For enterprise data infrastructure, what's your typical SQL-to-close conversion rate? This will help us assess if $2,000 per SQL creates profitable unit economics.

Turn 6:
Excellent behavioral signals - data volume growth, compliance mandates, performance bottlenecks, and migration projects. These create urgent, budget-backed initiatives.

**Contextual**: What industries or company types have the most acute data infrastructure challenges? Are you seeing stronger demand from financial services, healthcare, tech companies, or other verticals? And what technology environments signal the highest intent - companies using specific databases, cloud platforms, or analytics tools?

Turn 7:
Let me recalculate immediately. $600K ÷ 500 SQLs = $1,200 per SQL. That's 40% more efficient than your original $2,000 target.

For enterprise data infrastructure, $1,200 per SQL is extremely aggressive - you're now targeting 60-75% below typical benchmarks of $3,000-$5,000. This will require exceptional precision:

- Ultra-tight behavioral targeting around those pain points (data growth, compliance, performance)
- Heavy reliance on first-party data and lookalikes from your best customers
- Likely 30-40 targeting signals across all dimensions
- Account-based approach focusing on named target accounts

Alternative: Reduce target to 300 SQLs at $2,000 each, which maintains realistic efficiency but cuts pipeline to $45M. 

Which direction makes more sense - push for maximum targeting precision to hit 500 SQLs, or adjust volume targets to match the budget reality?

Turn 8:
Smart strategic pivot. You're absolutely right - $1,200 per SQL demands surgical precision over broad reach.

Before we lock in LinkedIn and intent-based programmatic in Step 7, let's finish defining your targeting precision. You mentioned contextual signals - what industries and technology environments signal highest intent? 

For example, are you seeing stronger demand from financial services dealing with regulatory data, healthcare with patient data governance, or tech companies scaling analytics infrastructure? And what technology stack signals - specific databases, cloud platforms, or analytics tools - indicate companies ready to invest in enterprise data infrastructure?

This will determine how tight we can make your targeting to hit that aggressive efficiency target.

Turn 9:
Perfect targeting foundation. Tech and financial services with Snowflake/AWS/Databricks stacks, plus legacy Oracle/Teradata modernization signals. These are high-intent, high-budget prospects.

**Geography**: Are you targeting globally, North America only, or specific regions? Enterprise data infrastructure buying patterns can vary significantly by geography, and your $1,200 per SQL efficiency target may require geographic focus on your highest-converting markets.

Turn 11:
Perfect. 500-600 total target accounts means you need roughly 1 SQL per target account - that's pure account-based strategy territory.

With such a finite universe, your $1,200 per SQL becomes more achievable through precision rather than scale:

**Targeting Precision Required:**
- Account-based lists of those 500-600 specific companies
- Role-based targeting within each account (multiple decision makers)
- Technology stack and behavioral triggers for timing
- Multiple touchpoints per account to drive conversion

**Budget Allocation Strategy:**
Your $600K budget across 500-600 accounts = $1,000-$1,200 per target account. This suggests a coordinated multi-touch approach rather than broad prospecting.

Now for Step 5 - Budget allocation. Beyond the geographic split, how do you want to allocate between acquisition of net-new accounts versus nurturing existing prospects in your pipeline?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 10:
Excellent geographic focus. US (70%), UK (20%), Germany (10%) aligns with mature enterprise buying patterns.

Let me build your targeting framework:

| Geography | Weight | Budget Allocation | Target SQLs | Cost per SQL |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|-------------|--------------|
| US | 70% | $420K | 350 | $1,200 |
| UK | 20% | $120K | 100 | $1,200 |
| Germany | 10% | $60K | 50 | $1,200 |
| **Total** | **100%** | **$600K** | **500** | **$1,200** |

**Target Audience Sizing**: Within each geography, you're targeting VP/Director-level data infrastructure leaders at 5000+ employee companies in tech and financial services, using Snowflake/AWS/Databricks or modernizing from Oracle/Teradata.

How many target accounts do you estimate exist in each market that match these criteria?

Turn 13:
Excellent value proposition framework - "infrastructure transformation" with trigger-specific messaging around elasticity, frictionless migration, and built-in governance.

**Channel Strategy**: Given your surgical targeting requirements and $1,200 per SQL efficiency target, you mentioned LinkedIn and intent-based programmatic as likely channels.

For your 500-600 target accounts requiring multiple decision-maker touchpoints, what channel mix do you think will deliver the precision you need? Are you thinking LinkedIn for direct engagement, programmatic for account-based display, and potentially direct mail or email for high-touch nurture sequences?

Turn 14:
Perfect channel strategy for your precision requirements. LinkedIn for direct engagement, intent-based programmatic for surround-sound, and personalized nurture sequences.

**Channel Allocation**: With your $600K budget across three channels targeting 500-600 accounts, how do you want to weight the spend? 

Given LinkedIn's higher CPMs but direct decision-maker access, programmatic's efficiency for awareness building, and the high-touch nature of your nurture sequences, what allocation makes sense - perhaps 50% LinkedIn, 30% programmatic, 20% nurture?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 12:
Smart allocation. 70% net-new acquisition ($420K for 350 SQLs) and 30% pipeline nurture ($180K for 150 SQLs from existing prospects).

**Budget Breakdown:**
- Net-new acquisition: $420K targeting 350 SQLs = $1,200 per SQL
- Pipeline nurture: $180K targeting 150 SQLs = $1,200 per SQL  
- Total: $600K for 500 SQLs

**Value Proposition Development**: With such surgical targeting, your messaging needs to be hyper-relevant. For your net-new acquisition, what's your core value proposition to those VP/Director-level data leaders dealing with infrastructure scaling challenges?

Are you positioning as the performance solution, the compliance-ready platform, or the seamless migration enabler - or does it vary by trigger (data growth vs. modernization vs. compliance)?

Turn 15:
Excellent allocation. LinkedIn ($300K), programmatic ($180K), nurture ($120K) targeting your 500-600 account universe.

**Measurement Framework**: With such aggressive efficiency targets, you'll need precise tracking. What's your measurement approach for validating that $1,200 per SQL across channels?

Are you tracking SQLs by source, using multi-touch attribution to credit assist channels, or running incrementality tests? Given your enterprise sales cycles and multiple decision makers per account, how will you measure channel contribution and optimize toward your pipeline value KPI?

Turn 16:
Strong measurement approach. Multi-touch attribution tracking pipeline value, not just SQL volume, with quarterly incrementality validation.

**Testing Strategy**: With your $1,200 per SQL efficiency target and finite 500-600 account universe, what's your testing approach? 

Are you planning audience tests (tech vs. financial services performance), message tests (elasticity vs. migration vs. governance), or channel optimization tests? Given your tight budget constraints, how will you balance learning with performance?

Turn 17:
Smart testing approach. Sequential audience tests (tech vs. financial services), message tests (elasticity vs. migration vs. governance), with 10-15% budget allocation per quarter for controlled learning.

**Risk Assessment**: Let's identify the key risks that could derail your aggressive $1,200 per SQL target and 500 SQL goal.

What concerns you most - audience saturation within your 500-600 account universe, competitive pressure driving up costs, attribution challenges in complex enterprise sales cycles, or budget timing constraints? And what's your contingency plan if early performance signals show you're tracking above $1,200 per SQL?

Turn 18:
Excellent risk identification. Audience saturation is your primary threat with such a finite target universe.

**Risk Mitigation Plan:**
- **Audience Saturation**: Monitor frequency caps and engagement rates weekly. If saturation signals appear, expand to adjacent verticals (manufacturing, retail with complex data needs) or broaden job titles (senior managers, architects).
- **Performance Monitoring**: Establish $1,500 per SQL as your red-line trigger. Above this, pause underperforming segments and reallocate to top performers.
- **Sales Feedback Loop**: Weekly pipeline quality reviews to ensure SQLs convert at your 22.5% historical rate.

**Plan Summary:** $600K budget, 500 SQLs at $1,200 each, targeting 500-600 enterprise accounts across US/UK/Germany, using LinkedIn/programmatic/nurture with multi-touch attribution and quarterly testing.
