TURN 1 (Step 1)

USER:
Hi, I'm the Director of Digital Marketing at SecureLife Insurance. We sell life and annuity products. I need to build a media plan for next year. We have a $750K budget and need 15,000 new policy applications. Our average LTV is about $2,800 per policyholder. Can you help?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Perfect start - you've given me strong foundation data. Let me run the numbers: $750K ÷ 15,000 applications = $50 per application. With $2,800 LTV, that's a 56:1 return ratio - very healthy for insurance.

However, I want to clarify the business outcome. Are you optimizing for 15,000 applications (top of funnel) or 15,000 actual new policyholders (conversions)? The distinction matters because application-to-policy conversion rates typically run 20-40% in insurance, which would significantly change our efficiency targets.

What's the primary business outcome you're driving toward?

TURN 2 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Wait, I need to stop you there. In insurance, we can't get anywhere near $50 per application. Our industry floor is around $120 per qualified lead, and that's on a good day. We've tried everything - that $50 number just isn't realistic for us. What does this mean for our plan?

AGENT:
You're absolutely right - thank you for that correction. $50 per application in insurance is completely unrealistic. Let me recalculate based on your $120 floor:

15,000 applications × $120 = $1.8M needed budget

You have $750K available, which projects to: $750K ÷ $120 = 6,250 applications

This creates a significant gap - you're targeting 15,000 but can realistically achieve about 6,250 with current budget and market efficiency. That's roughly 40% of your goal.

We have three paths forward:
1. Increase budget to ~$1.8M to hit 15,000 applications
2. Reduce target to ~6,250 applications within current budget  
3. Pursue aggressive efficiency improvements to drive cost per application below $120

Which direction makes most sense given your business constraints?

Wait, I need to stop you there. In insurance, we can't get anywhere near $50 per application. Our industry floor is around $120 per qualified lead, and that's on a good day. We've tried everything - that $50 number just isn't realistic for us. What does this mean for our plan?

AGENT:
You're absolutely right - thank you for that correction. $50 per application in insurance is completely unrealistic. Let me recalculate based on your $120 floor:

15,000 applications × $120 = $1.8M needed budget

You have $750K available, which projects to: $750K ÷ $120 = 6,250 applications

This creates a significant gap - you're targeting 15,000 but can realistically achieve about 6,250 with current budget and market efficiency. That's roughly 40% of your goal.

We have three paths forward:
1. Increase budget to ~$1.8M to hit 15,000 applications
2. Reduce target to ~6,250 applications within current budget
3. Pursue aggressive efficiency improvements to drive cost per application below $120

Which direction makes most sense given your business constraints?
