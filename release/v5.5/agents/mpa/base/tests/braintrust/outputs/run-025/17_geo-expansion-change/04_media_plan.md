# Media Plan Output: Geography Expansion Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business outcome. You mentioned wanting 500,000 store visits and online conversions combined. Is your primary objective customer acquisition, or are you looking to drive both new customers and repeat purchases from existing ones?

Turn 2:
Perfect - 70% new customer acquisition, 30% existing customer retention. That's a smart balanced approach for sustainable growth.

For measuring success, what's your primary KPI? Are you tracking customers acquired, total revenue, or something else as your main success metric?

And when you say 500,000 store visits and online conversions combined - are you looking at that as 500,000 new customers, or does that include repeat transactions from existing customers too?

Turn 3:
Excellent - so your objective is customer acquisition, your KPI is customer acquisition cost (CAC), and your target is 500,000 new customers.

Let me run the efficiency math: $2.5M budget ÷ 500,000 customers = $5 CAC target.

That's extremely aggressive for athletic apparel. Based on industry benchmarks, athletic/fitness brands typically see $25-75 CAC depending on price point and competition. At $5, you're targeting 80-90% below market rates.

To put this in perspective - are you thinking of very low-cost acquisition tactics, or should we reconsider either the budget or volume target to hit a more realistic efficiency?

Turn 4:
Smart adjustment. Let me recalculate: $2.5M ÷ 250,000 customers = $10 CAC.

That's still aggressive for athletic apparel - about 60% below typical benchmarks of $25-75. But it's much more realistic, especially for a growing brand with tight targeting.

To hit $10 CAC, we'll need excellent audience precision and channel efficiency. This is ambitious but achievable with the right approach.

Before we dive into who your customers are, I need to understand your unit economics. What's the average order value for a new customer, and what profit margin are you working with? This helps ensure the $10 CAC makes financial sense for your business.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 5:
Let me model your unit economics. At $180 AOV with 45% margin, that's $81 profit per new customer. With $10 CAC, you'd have $71 profit remaining - a healthy 8:1 profit-to-CAC ratio.

That's actually strong unit economics that support growth investment. Most athletic brands target 3-5:1 ratios, so you have room to be aggressive on acquisition.

Your $10 CAC target makes sense financially. The challenge is execution - athletic apparel typically runs $25-75 CAC, so hitting $10 requires exceptional targeting precision and channel efficiency.

Now that we've confirmed your economics work, let's define your audience. You mentioned "active adults 25-45" - can you describe what "active" means for your ideal customer? Are we talking daily gym-goers, weekend warriors, yoga enthusiasts, or something else?

Turn 6:
Perfect - fitness lifestyle enthusiasts with 3-4 weekly structured workouts, disposable income, and quality gear investment mindset. That's a well-defined audience with strong purchase intent.

This audience typically shows high engagement with fitness content, follows fitness influencers, and researches gear purchases. Their consideration window is usually longer since they invest thoughtfully in quality pieces.

For your $10 CAC target, this audience definition helps - fitness enthusiasts are easier to identify through behavioral signals than general "active" consumers. We can target based on gym memberships, fitness app usage, athletic brand engagement, and workout-related content consumption.

You mentioned US market - are you planning national reach, or do you want to focus on specific regions or metro areas where this audience is most concentrated?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 7:
Let me update our projections. Adding Canada and Mexico to 250,000 customers means we're now planning tri-national expansion with your $2.5M budget.

This significantly impacts targeting precision and costs. Cross-border campaigns typically run 20-40% higher CAC due to currency, logistics, and market maturity differences.

For budget efficiency, I'd recommend: US 70% ($1.75M), Canada 20% ($500K), Mexico 10% ($250K) based on market maturity and your distribution timeline.

That would target roughly:
- US: 175,000 customers at ~$10 CAC  
- Canada: 35,000 customers at ~$14 CAC
- Mexico: 15,000 customers at ~$17 CAC

Does this geographic split align with your distribution strategy and market priorities? We'll need to adjust audience targeting for cultural and competitive differences in each market.

Turn 8:
Excellent point on localized creative - fitness culture definitely varies across markets. US focuses heavily on performance metrics, Canada emphasizes outdoor/seasonal training, and Mexico has strong community/group fitness traditions.

That confirms your geography strategy is sound. Now let's define your audience more precisely for targeting.

Beyond "fitness enthusiasts who work out 3-4x weekly," what other characteristics help identify your ideal customer? For example:

- Income level (you mentioned disposable income - what range?)
- Specific interests beyond fitness (nutrition, wellness, outdoor activities?)
- Shopping behaviors (research extensively, buy premium brands, etc.?)

This precision will be crucial for hitting your aggressive $10-14-17 CAC targets across the three markets.

Turn 9:
Perfect - that's a highly targetable audience. $100-175K household income, wellness-focused lifestyle, research-driven with premium brand affinity. The Lululemon/Strava ecosystem reference is particularly valuable for targeting.

This audience profile supports your aggressive CAC targets. They're easier to identify through:
- Premium fitness brand engagement 
- Wellness app usage (MyFitnessPal, Headspace, Strava)
- High-intent research behaviors
- Disposable income signals

Their research-driven nature means longer consideration cycles but higher conversion rates once engaged.

Now for budget allocation - you have $2.5M total with our geographic split established. How much of that budget needs to be reserved for creative production, especially given your three-market localization requirements? And do you have any budget flexibility for testing and optimization, or is this a fixed allocation?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 10:
Smart planning. Let me break down your budget structure:

- Creative production: $375K (15%)
- Testing/optimization reserve: $213K (10% of remaining $2.13M media budget)
- **Active media budget: $1.91M**

This gives us:
- US: $1.34M (70%) → ~134,000 customers at $10 CAC
- Canada: $383K (20%) → ~27,000 customers at $14 CAC  
- Mexico: $191K (10%) → ~11,000 customers at $17 CAC
- **Total: ~172,000 customers vs. your 250K target**

We have a significant gap. Your reserve strategy is excellent, but we're 78,000 customers short of goal. Should we adjust the customer target to match realistic budget, or do we need to revisit total investment to hit 250K customers?

Turn 11:
Perfect - 175,000 customers is a much stronger plan. Quality over quantity, with room for optimization and premium creative. That's smart growth strategy.

Now let's define your value proposition. You're targeting research-driven fitness enthusiasts who invest in performance gear and view fitness as lifestyle.

What makes ActiveWear Pro different from Lululemon, Nike, or other premium athletic brands your audience already knows? Is it specific technical features, price positioning, style approach, or something else that gives you a competitive edge with these discerning consumers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 12:
Excellent positioning - "performance optimization through cutting-edge textile engineering" differentiates you from style-focused (Lululemon) and mass-performance (Nike) competitors.

Your value proposition of "functional innovation" with specific benefits (adaptive moisture-wicking, recovery compression, precision fit) gives research-driven consumers concrete reasons to choose you. This technical focus should resonate strongly with your CrossFit/serious training audience.

This positioning supports premium pricing and justifies the research phase your customers go through before purchasing.

Now for channels - given your technical innovation story and research-driven audience, what channels are you currently using or considering? Are you thinking digital-first, or do you want to include traditional channels like connected TV or out-of-home?

Turn 13:
Excellent channel thinking - you're matching platforms to audience behavior perfectly. Research-driven fitness enthusiasts are heavy consumers of YouTube reviews, Instagram fitness content, and wellness podcasts.

Given your $1.91M active media budget across three markets and 175,000 customer target, let me suggest an initial allocation:

**Search (35% - $668K):** Capture high-intent research behavior
**YouTube/Video (25% - $478K):** Product demos and technical features  
**Social/Influencer (20% - $382K):** Instagram fitness community
**Podcast (10% - $191K):** Wellness/fitness show sponsorships
**Connected TV (10% - $191K):** Premium audience during fitness programming

This prioritizes your research-capture channels while testing broader awareness.

Does this allocation align with how you see your customers discovering and researching ActiveWear Pro? Any channels you'd weight differently?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 14:
Perfect - increasing YouTube makes complete sense for showcasing technical fabric innovations. Let me adjust:

**Revised allocation:**
- **Search (35% - $668K):** High-intent research capture
- **YouTube/Video (30% - $573K):** Technical demos + product education  
- **Social/Influencer (18% - $344K):** Instagram fitness community
- **Podcast (10% - $191K):** Wellness show sponsorships
- **Connected TV (7% - $134K):** Premium audience reach

The extra YouTube investment supports your technical storytelling advantage and gives more budget for localized creative across markets.

For measurement, what's most important to track beyond CAC? Are you focused on view-through attribution, incrementality testing, or specific engagement metrics that indicate research-driven behavior patterns?
