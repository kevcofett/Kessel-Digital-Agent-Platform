# Media Plan Output: Audience Removal Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by modeling your efficiency target. $4M / 15,000 test drives = $267 per test drive. For automotive, test drive costs typically run $150-400, so you're in the middle range - realistic but will require solid execution.

Your business outcome is clear: drive test drives to launch the new EV. But what happens after the test drive that defines campaign success? Are you measuring just test drives, or tracking through to actual vehicle sales?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So test drives are your primary KPI at $267 each, but the real business outcome is vehicle sales conversion. 

To assess if your $267 efficiency is achievable, I need to understand the unit economics. What's the average selling price of the new EV, and what's your gross margin per vehicle sold?

This helps determine how much you can afford per test drive based on conversion rates and still hit profitability targets.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Got it - 15,000 test drives over 6 months with aggressive ramp-up in California and Texas. That's 2,500 test drives per month average, but likely front-loaded for momentum.

Your economics are solid and timeline is defined. Step 2 complete.

Now for Step 3 - Audience. You mentioned three segments: eco-conscious early adopters 25-45, luxury buyers 45-65 switching from German sedans, and tech enthusiasts focused on features.

Let's start with the luxury switchers since they likely have the highest purchase intent. For the 45-65 German sedan owners, what specific behaviors signal they're ready to consider an EV? Are they researching sustainability, frustrated with gas prices, or drawn to tech upgrades?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Let me model this. At $65K ASP with 15-20% margin, you're looking at $9,750-$13,000 gross profit per vehicle. Using the midpoint of $11,375 per vehicle:

$11,375 ÷ $267 per test drive = you need a 2.3% conversion rate from test drive to purchase to break even on media spend alone.

For luxury EVs, test drive conversion typically runs 8-15%, so your economics look solid. Even at 5% conversion, each test drive generates $569 in gross profit against $267 in acquisition cost.

This gives you healthy room for the full sales cycle costs beyond media. Your $267 target is definitely achievable given these margins.

Now that economics check out, what's your target timeline for generating these 15,000 test drives?

Turn 5:
Perfect. That segment has clear behavioral signals - researching EV performance comparisons, luxury maintenance costs, and sustainability status symbols.

For the eco-conscious early adopters 25-45, what specific environmental behaviors or interests define this group beyond just caring about sustainability? Are they already driving hybrids, following climate news, purchasing organic/sustainable products, or part of environmental communities?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Excellent - that's a well-defined behavioral profile. Active sustainability engagement, hybrid/Tesla ownership, urban professionals with premium eco-conscious shopping patterns.

Now for tech enthusiasts who care about features. What specific technology interests define this group? Are they early adopters of consumer tech, following automotive innovation, interested in autonomous features, or focused on performance specs like acceleration and range?

Turn 7:
Perfect. Three well-defined segments with distinct behavioral signals:
- Luxury switchers: researching EV performance vs German sedans, sustainability status
- Eco-conscious: active sustainability engagement, hybrid/Tesla ownership, premium eco shopping
- Tech enthusiasts: early adopter behavior, following automotive innovation, performance specs

Now for Step 4 - Geography. You mentioned California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Washington as focus states. 

For your aggressive California and Texas ramp-up strategy, which specific metro areas within those states are highest priority? Are you thinking LA/SF/San Diego for California and Dallas/Houston/Austin for Texas, or different markets?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Smart decision. Focusing on two segments lets you go deeper with $4M instead of spreading thin across three.

$4M / 15,000 test drives still equals $267 per test drive, but now you can allocate more budget per segment for better targeting precision and frequency.

With two segments, you could potentially split roughly $2M each, giving you meaningful scale in both eco-conscious early adopters and luxury switchers. This should improve performance since each segment gets sufficient budget for optimization.

Back to geography - for your California and Texas focus, which specific metro areas are highest priority for these two remaining segments?

Turn 9:
Excellent metro targeting. Bay Area/LA for eco-conscious, Austin for eco-conscious, Dallas for luxury switchers - all have strong EV infrastructure and match your segment profiles.

What about the other states? You mentioned Florida, New York, and Washington. Which metros there are priorities, and how do they split between your eco-conscious and luxury switcher segments?

Turn 10:
Perfect geography mapping:
- **Eco-conscious priority**: SF Bay Area, LA, Austin, NYC (Manhattan/Brooklyn), Seattle
- **Luxury switcher priority**: Dallas, Miami, NYC (Manhattan/Brooklyn)
- **Both segments**: NYC and Seattle

That's 7 metros with clear segment focus. Strong foundation.

Moving to Step 5 - Budget allocation. With $4M across two segments and these metros, how are you thinking about budget split between eco-conscious early adopters versus luxury switchers? Equal $2M each, or does one segment get priority based on conversion potential or market size?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 11:
Smart allocation. $2.4M for eco-conscious at 9,000 test drives = $267 per test drive. $1.6M for luxury switchers at 6,000 test drives = also $267 per test drive. Both segments maintain your target efficiency.

The 60/40 split makes sense given EV adoption readiness, and luxury switchers do typically need more proof points and longer consideration cycles.

For geographic budget allocation within segments, are you planning equal investment across metros, or do markets like SF Bay Area and Miami command premium investment due to market size or strategic importance?

Turn 12:
Perfect allocation strategy. Let me calculate the key splits:

**Eco-conscious ($2.4M):**
- SF Bay Area + LA: ~$960K (40%)
- Austin, NYC, Seattle: ~$1.44M (60%)

**Luxury switchers ($1.6M):**
- Miami + Dallas: ~$560K (35%)
- NYC, Seattle: ~$1.04M (65%)

This concentrates spend where segment density is highest while maintaining strategic presence in secondary markets.

Moving to Step 6 - Value Proposition. For your eco-conscious early adopters, what's the primary message that differentiates ElectraDrive from Tesla and other EVs they're already considering? What makes them switch from their current Prius or Model 3?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 13:
Strong sustainability differentiation - holistic environmental approach versus just electric driving. That should resonate with your highly engaged eco-conscious segment.

For luxury switchers coming from German sedans, what's your primary value proposition? Are you emphasizing performance that matches their BMW/Mercedes/Audi, or positioning ElectraDrive as superior in specific areas like technology, cost of ownership, or driving experience?

Turn 14:
Excellent positioning - performance parity with superior economics. That directly addresses their German sedan maintenance frustrations.

Step 6 complete. Now Step 7 - Channels.

Given your segment targeting and metro focus, which digital channels do you think will be most effective for reaching eco-conscious early adopters in SF Bay Area, LA, Austin, NYC, and Seattle? Are you thinking Meta, Google, connected TV, or other platforms based on where this audience spends time?
