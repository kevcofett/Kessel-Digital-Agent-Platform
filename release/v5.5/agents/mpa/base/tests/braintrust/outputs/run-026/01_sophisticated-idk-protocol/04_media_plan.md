# Media Plan Output: Sophisticated User - IDK Protocol

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've given me a great starting point - 10,000 new users with $500K spend. Let me calculate what this means:

$500K ÷ 10,000 users = $50 cost per customer

For fintech user acquisition, this is aggressive. Typical runs $75-150 based on industry benchmarks due to trust barriers and regulatory complexity.

To clarify your business outcome: Are you focused purely on user acquisition volume, or do you need these users to reach a specific activity level (like first transaction, account funding, or transaction volume)?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect - that's a much stronger success metric. Active users who complete transactions have real value versus empty signups.

Let me update the math: $500K ÷ 10,000 transacting users = $50 per activated user.

For fintech with transaction completion requirements, $50 is very aggressive. Typical activated user costs run $100-200+ due to the conversion funnel from signup to first transaction.

To assess if $50 is achievable, what's the typical value you see from a user who completes their first transaction? This could be average transaction revenue, first-year customer value, or however you measure user worth.
