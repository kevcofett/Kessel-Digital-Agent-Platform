USER:
Hi! I'm looking to get more people to buy shoes from our online store. Can you help me figure out the best way to do that?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What business outcome are you trying to achieve? For example, are you looking to get more customers, increase sales from existing customers, or build brand awareness?

USER:
I definitely want to get more customers buying our shoes online. Right now, we're not selling as much as I'd like, so bringing in new people who will purchase from our website is my main goal. I want to see our sales numbers go up.

AGENT:
Perfect! Getting new customers to buy shoes online is a clear objective. 

To measure success, what specific number would tell you this is working? For example, are you focused on total number of new customers, total sales dollars, or something else?

USER:
I'm hoping to get at least 500 new customers in the next three months. Our online sales have been pretty flat, so we really need to see some growth. I want to make sure we're bringing in new people who will actually buy our shoes, not just look around.

AGENT:
Great! So we're targeting 500 new customers in three months. That gives us a clear goal to work toward.

Now I need to understand if this target is realistic for your budget. What's a typical customer worth to your business - meaning how much revenue do you usually get from someone who buys shoes from you?
