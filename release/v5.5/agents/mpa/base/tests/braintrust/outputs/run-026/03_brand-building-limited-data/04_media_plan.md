# Media Plan Output: Brand Building with Limited Data

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You mentioned building brand awareness in the West Coast market with $500K. To start strong, I need to understand your success definition.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with this brand awareness campaign?

Turn 2:
Perfect! You want to establish GreenLeaf as a trusted supplement brand and drive online sales among health-conscious millennials and Gen Z.

Now I need to understand how you'll measure success. Brand awareness campaigns need concrete numbers to track progress.

What specific number will tell you this campaign succeeded? For example: a certain number of new customers, a sales revenue target, or a brand awareness percentage?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Great targets! Let me check the math on what you're aiming for.

$500K budget targeting 5,000 customers = $100 per customer acquisition cost. With $750K revenue from 5,000 customers, that's $150 average order value.

For natural supplements, typical customer acquisition costs run $60-120, so $100 is right in the realistic range. Your 1.5x revenue-to-budget ratio is conservative and achievable.

Now for the economics: What's a typical customer worth to you over time, or what profit margin do you usually see on supplement sales?

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Got it. For supplement brands, customers typically purchase 3-4 times in their first year with 40-50% margins. I'll model using $200 customer lifetime value based on industry benchmarks for wellness products. You can refine this as you gather data.

Let me validate your targets: At $100 cost per customer with $200 lifetime value, you're looking at a healthy 2:1 return. This is conservative and achievable for supplement brands.

Your plan looks financially sound. Moving to Step 3 - let's define your audience precisely.

You mentioned health-conscious millennials and Gen Z. What specific behaviors or interests help you identify your ideal supplement customers?

Turn 5:
Excellent audience definition! Those behavioral signals paint a clear picture of your wellness-focused customer.

Let me size this audience for your West Coast markets. Based on your criteria - fitness/nutrition interest, wellness influencer followers, premium grocery shoppers, yoga/CrossFit participants - you're looking at roughly 8-12% of millennials and Gen Z in California, Oregon, and Washington.

That gives us approximately 2.8-4.2 million people in your target audience across those three states, which is plenty of scale for your 5,000 customer goal.

Moving to Step 4 - let's get specific about geography. Within California, Oregon, and Washington, are there particular metro areas or regions you want to prioritize?

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Perfect focus! San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, and Portland are ideal for wellness brands - high income, health-conscious demographics, and strong millennial/Gen Z populations.

Those three metros represent about 40% of your total West Coast audience but likely 60-70% of your high-value prospects. Smart prioritization for brand establishment.

Moving to Step 5 - let's allocate your $500K budget. 

How do you want to split your budget between these three metro areas? Should we weight it by market size, opportunity, or do you have a preference for where to invest most heavily?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
That allocation makes perfect sense! Bay Area gets $200K (40%), Seattle $150K (30%), Portland $150K (30%).

Your reasoning is spot-on - Bay Area has the highest concentration of health-conscious tech professionals with strong purchasing power. Seattle and Portland both punch above their weight for wellness engagement.

Let me validate the math: 
- Bay Area: $200K ÷ ~2,000 target customers = $100 per customer
- Seattle: $150K ÷ ~1,500 target customers = $100 per customer  
- Portland: $150K ÷ ~1,500 target customers = $100 per customer

Clean $100 cost per customer across all markets - very manageable for supplement acquisition.

Moving to Step 6 - what makes GreenLeaf different from other supplement brands? What's your key value proposition for these health-conscious consumers?
