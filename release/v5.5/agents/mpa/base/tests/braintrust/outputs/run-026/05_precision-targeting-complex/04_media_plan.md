# Media Plan Output: Precision Targeting with Complex Attributes

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I am excited to build a media plan with you. We will cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've provided excellent detail upfront. Let me clarify your primary business objective: Are you looking to acquire new clients (convert leads to managed assets) or generate qualified leads for your sales team to nurture?

The distinction matters because it changes how we measure success and model economics.

Turn 2:
Perfect - client acquisition with $5M+ AUM as the ultimate outcome. That's a high-value, long-cycle objective.

For measuring success, what's your primary KPI? Are you tracking:
- Cost per qualified lead (with lead scoring)
- Cost per new client acquired 
- Return on ad spend based on first-year fees
- Something else?

Given the 12-18 month sales cycles typical in wealth management, I want to ensure we're measuring the right leading indicator while keeping the $5M+ AUM end goal in focus.

Turn 3:
Excellent - cost per qualified lead with lead scoring is the right approach for this cycle length.

Let me model your efficiency target: $1.5M budget ÷ 2,500 qualified leads = $600 per MQL.

For wealth management targeting $1M+ investable assets, benchmarks typically run $400-800 per qualified lead based on targeting precision and geography. At $600, you're in the middle of that range - achievable with disciplined audience targeting.

Given your CRM data on 50K clients, this looks realistic. The key will be tight lookalike modeling and behavioral signals that mirror your highest-converting prospects.

What's the typical value of a new client relationship in first-year fees? This helps validate whether $600 per lead creates positive unit economics even before the full AUM conversion.

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Outstanding economics. At $75-100K first-year fees with even 10% conversion, you're looking at $7,500-10,000 revenue per lead against $600 cost - that's 12-16x return. Very strong unit economics that justify premium targeting.

Your behavioral signals around liquidity events and business transitions are exactly right for this efficiency target. Those intent signals will be crucial for hitting qualified leads rather than just high-income browsers.

Moving to Step 3 - Audience. You've outlined the foundation: $1M+ investable assets, 45-65, executives/business owners. 

Let me dig deeper into the behavioral layer: When you say "recent liquidity events" - are we talking business sales, IPOs, real estate exits, or inheritance? The more specific we can get about these trigger moments, the better we can target people actively in transition rather than passively wealthy.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 5:
Perfect - business sales and IPO liquidity events give us precise targeting opportunities. Tech founders/executives post-liquidity are ideal because they're actively seeking solutions, not just passively wealthy.

For audience precision: Are you targeting people currently in transaction (6-12 months out from liquidity) or recently completed (0-24 months post-event)? 

The timing matters significantly for intent signals and messaging. Pre-liquidity prospects research tax strategies and wealth management options. Post-liquidity prospects need immediate portfolio structuring and ongoing management.

This distinction affects which behavioral signals we layer - forward-looking tax planning content versus post-transaction wealth preservation research.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent timing window - that 0-12 month post-liquidity sweet spot when they're strategically engaged but not yet committed elsewhere.

Moving to Step 4 - Geography. You've identified the top HNW DMAs. Given your focus on tech founders/executives, should we weight allocation toward SF Bay Area and Seattle where tech liquidity events are most concentrated? 

Or do you prefer even distribution across all ten markets? Your budget allows meaningful presence in each DMA, but concentration in tech-heavy markets might yield higher qualified lead rates given your ideal client profile.

Turn 7:
Smart allocation - concentrating 40% in SF/Seattle leverages your highest-conversion markets.

Let me model this: 40% concentration = $600K for SF/Seattle, $900K for remaining 8 markets. At $600 per MQL target, that's 1,000 qualified leads from SF/Seattle and 1,500 from other markets.

Given tech liquidity density, SF/Seattle should outperform that ratio - potentially 1,200+ leads from those markets if targeting is precise.

Moving to Step 5 - Budget allocation. Within your geographic split, how do you want to balance investment across funnel stages? 

Are you thinking 70% acquisition focus with 30% for nurturing/retargeting, or do you prefer heavier acquisition weighting given the long sales cycles and need to build qualified pipeline volume?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Excellent - 85% acquisition maximizes your qualified pipeline building. At $1.5M total, that's $1.275M for acquisition and $225K for MQL-to-SQL nurturing.

This allocation makes sense given your target's sophistication - these prospects do their research thoroughly upfront, so capturing them at first engagement is critical.

Moving to Step 6 - Value Proposition. Given you're targeting post-liquidity tech founders who are intellectually engaged but not yet committed to a wealth manager:

What's your primary value differentiator? Are you positioning around tax optimization expertise, portfolio complexity management, or something else that resonates specifically with this tech-savvy, high-net-worth audience who likely has multiple wealth management options?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Powerful positioning - "strategic partner who thinks three moves ahead" perfectly captures the intellectual sophistication these prospects expect.

Your tax optimization angle is spot-on for post-liquidity tech founders dealing with complex equity structures and multi-jurisdictional scenarios. This differentiates you from traditional wealth managers who treat them like any other high-net-worth client.

Moving to Step 7 - Channels. Given your sophisticated audience, premium positioning, and need for precise targeting:

What's your initial thinking on channel priorities? LinkedIn for professional targeting, search for active intent capture, or are you considering other channels that might reach tech executives researching tax optimization strategies?

The $600 per MQL target and 85% acquisition focus will drive our channel selection and budget allocation.
