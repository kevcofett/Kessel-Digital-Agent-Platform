# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience Unified Media Plan

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

I can see you have three distinct segments with clear demographic profiles - that's excellent strategic thinking. Before we dive into the segment-specific targeting and messaging, I need to establish the foundation.

What business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 25,000 new enrollees?

Turn 2:
Perfect - market share growth with improved acquisition efficiency is clear. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success as a number.

What's your primary KPI for this campaign? Are you focused on cost per enrollment, lifetime value to acquisition cost ratio, or another specific metric?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it - CAC under $120 per enrollment is your primary success metric. Let me run the math on your targets.

$3M budget ÷ 25,000 enrollments = $120 per enrollment exactly. You're targeting right at your efficiency ceiling with no buffer.

For health insurance, typical CACs run $150-250 based on industry benchmarks, so $120 is aggressive - about 20-50% more efficient than market standard. This is ambitious but achievable with tight targeting across your three segments.

Since you're at your exact efficiency target, any budget overrun or volume shortfall creates immediate problems. We'll need precise audience definition and channel efficiency to hit this.

Do you have a sense of what a typical customer is worth to TrueHealth over their lifetime, even roughly?

Turn 4:
Excellent - at $1,200-1,500 LTV against $120 CAC, you're targeting a 10-12.5x ratio, which is very healthy for insurance. That validates your efficiency target is sustainable if achieved.

Your economics foundation is solid. Now let's define your audiences precisely since your $120 target demands exceptional targeting accuracy.

Starting with Young Professionals (ages 26-35 in urban metros): Beyond gym membership and digital preference, what specific behavioral or professional signals identify your highest-value prospects in this segment? For example, recent job changes, income thresholds, or life events that trigger insurance shopping?

Turn 5:
Perfect - job transitions, city moves, and the $75-125K income band are excellent behavioral triggers. The combination of professional networking activity and fitness app engagement creates strong signal layering.

For Families (ages 35-50 in suburban markets): What life events or behavioral patterns signal when these families are actively shopping for health insurance? Are you seeing specific triggers like new babies, school enrollment periods, or spouse job changes that indicate high purchase intent?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Excellent trigger identification - new babies, school enrollment, and spouse job transitions are powerful intent signals. The timing around these life events creates natural shopping windows.

For Pre-Medicare (ages 55-64): What signals indicate when this segment is actively evaluating insurance options? Are you seeing patterns around early retirement planning, COBRA transitions, or specific health events that drive shopping behavior?

Turn 7:
Perfect - COBRA transitions, early retirement planning, and health status changes create clear intent windows. The 6-12 month advance planning timeline is valuable for targeting.

Now let's define your geography precisely. You mentioned specific metros for Young Professionals and suburban markets for Families. 

For Young Professionals in NYC, SF, LA, Chicago - do you want to target the entire DMAs or focus on specific urban cores and corridors within these markets?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Perfect - urban core targeting in tech/financial districts will improve efficiency significantly versus broad DMA coverage.

For Families in suburban markets around top 50 metros: Are you targeting specific suburban rings (like 15-30 miles from city centers), or do you have income/demographic criteria that define your priority suburban zones?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Excellent - that income band and suburban profile creates very targetable geography. School district quality and newer developments are smart demographic proxies.

For Pre-Medicare (ages 55-64) you mentioned national with heavy concentration in FL, AZ, TX. Are you targeting specific regions within those states, or is this more about following retirement migration patterns and warm-weather destinations?

Turn 10:
Perfect geography definition. You've identified high-value micro-markets within each state that align with retirement migration and healthcare infrastructure.

Now for budget allocation across your three segments. With $3M total budget and 25,000 enrollments at $120 CAC, how do you want to distribute volume targets across Young Professionals, Families, and Pre-Medicare segments?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Let me validate those allocations against your $120 CAC target:

**Young Professionals:** $1.05M ÷ 8,750 = $120 CAC ✓
**Families:** $1.35M ÷ 11,250 = $120 CAC ✓  
**Pre-Medicare:** $600K ÷ 5,000 = $120 CAC ✓

Your math is precise - each segment hits exactly $120. However, this assumes identical acquisition efficiency across very different audiences and geographies. In reality, Pre-Medicare typically costs more due to higher consideration periods, while Young Professionals might be more efficient through digital channels.

Should we model different CAC targets by segment based on their behavioral differences, or do you want to maintain $120 across all three as a blended average?

Turn 12:
Smart approach - segment-specific CACs with blended averaging gives you operational flexibility. Let me model realistic ranges:

**Young Professionals:** $90-100 CAC (digital efficiency)
**Families:** $115-125 CAC (moderate consideration) 
**Pre-Medicare:** $150-175 CAC (high-touch, longer sales cycle)

At these ranges, you could achieve:
- YP: $875K ÷ $95 = 9,200 enrollments
- Families: $1.35M ÷ $120 = 11,250 enrollments  
- Pre-Medicare: $775K ÷ $155 = 5,000 enrollments

Total: 25,450 enrollments at $118 blended CAC - slightly beating your target.

This reallocation (29%/45%/26% budget split) reflects realistic acquisition costs while maintaining volume goals.

Now let's develop your value propositions. For Young Professionals focused on convenience and digital experience, what's your core message that differentiates TrueHealth from competitors?

Turn 13:
Excellent positioning - "mobile-first insurance platform" and "on-demand service" speaks directly to digital native expectations. The telemedicine and transparent pricing address key young professional pain points.

For Families concerned about comprehensive coverage and cost predictability, how does TrueHealth's value proposition address their specific anxieties around protecting their children and managing healthcare expenses?

Turn 14:
Perfect - "no surprise medical bills" and "financial peace of mind" directly address family anxieties. The pediatric focus and wellness benefits show you understand family-specific needs.

For Pre-Medicare focused on stability and network quality, what's TrueHealth's value proposition around the transition to Medicare and maintaining healthcare continuity during this critical life stage?
