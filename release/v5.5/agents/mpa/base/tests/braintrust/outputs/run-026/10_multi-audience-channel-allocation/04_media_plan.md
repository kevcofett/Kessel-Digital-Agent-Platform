# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience with Segment-Specific Channels

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a sophisticated media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

I can see you've provided rich audience and geographic insights across three distinct segments. Before we dive into channel strategies, I need to establish the foundation.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 50,000 enrollments - revenue growth, market share expansion, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect - market share expansion with positioning as a credible education alternative. That's a dual objective requiring both volume and brand building.

Let me calculate the efficiency target: $5M ÷ 50,000 enrollments = $100 cost per enrollment (CAE). 

For online education, typical acquisition costs run $80-150 depending on program value. At $100, you're targeting the middle of the range - achievable but requires solid execution across your three distinct segments.

How do you define success numerically? Is it purely the 50,000 enrollments, or do you have a specific revenue target tied to those enrollments that would indicate you're hitting the right quality of students?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 4:
Got it. I'll model using 62.5% gross margin based on your 60-65% estimate - typical for digital education platforms with scalable delivery. You can refine this anytime.

Let me calculate what this means for your acquisition efficiency:

$1,500 program value × 62.5% margin = $937 gross profit per enrollment
$937 gross profit ÷ $100 CAE = 9.4x profit multiple

That's strong unit economics - well above the 3-4x minimum threshold. This gives you excellent room for the precise targeting your three segments require.

Your efficiency target is realistic and supports quality focus. The economics work for selective audience targeting across Career Changers, Gen Z, and Corporate L&D.

Ready to move to Step 3 and detail the targeting precision needed for each segment?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent. $75M revenue target with $1,500 average program value gives us clear quality benchmarks.

At $100 CAE against $1,500 program value, you're targeting a 15:1 return on acquisition spend - very healthy for education. This efficiency level supports your quality focus since you can afford selective targeting.

Before we architect the channel strategy for your three segments, I need to understand your unit economics. What's your typical gross margin on that $1,500 program revenue? This will determine how much room we have for aggressive targeting precision across Career Changers, Gen Z, and Corporate L&D segments.

Turn 5:
Perfect. With your strong unit economics, we can afford the precision targeting each segment demands.

Let me start with your Career Changers segment (28-42, tech hubs). You mentioned they do extensive research before enrolling and are heavy LinkedIn users.

For this research-driven audience, what specific behavioral signals beyond LinkedIn usage would indicate someone is actively considering career transition? For example, are they searching specific skill terms, engaging with career development content, or showing other digital behaviors that signal intent to upskill?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Excellent behavioral mapping. Those long-tail search terms and engagement patterns create a precise targeting funnel for Career Changers.

Now for your Gen Z segment (18-24, national with college town indexing). You mentioned they're creator-influenced and mobile-first on TikTok and Instagram.

What specific creator types or content themes resonate with this audience when they're considering education alternatives? Are they following career advice creators, educational content creators, or responding to different messaging around rejecting traditional college paths?

Turn 7:
Perfect - anti-establishment education narrative with skill-first success stories. That's a clear content strategy for TikTok and Instagram.

For your Corporate L&D segment (35-55, national with corporate HQ indexing), you mentioned they need an ABM approach with longer B2B sales cycles.

What specific job titles or organizational triggers indicate when these decision-makers are actively evaluating employee development solutions? Are they responding to workforce skill gaps, budget planning cycles, or specific business challenges that create urgency around upskilling initiatives?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Excellent. You have sophisticated targeting across all three segments with clear intent signals and organizational triggers.

Now for geography - you've outlined tech hubs for Career Changers, national with college town indexing for Gen Z, and corporate HQ cities for L&D. 

Given your $5M budget needs to work efficiently across these different geographic footprints, should we prioritize certain markets? For example, would you rather dominate 3-4 key tech hubs for Career Changers, or spread more broadly across the 6 cities you mentioned?

Turn 9:
Smart geographic strategy - concentrated dominance in SF, Seattle, and Austin for Career Changers will maximize brand presence and network effects.

For your Gen Z segment, you mentioned national reach indexing on college towns and urban centers. Given the concentrated approach working for Career Changers, would you prefer to identify the top 15-20 college markets for focused impact, or does the creator-driven TikTok/Instagram strategy require broader national reach to capture viral potential across all markets?

Turn 10:
Perfect - national scale with college town indexing for viral potential. That aligns with how Gen Z discovers content organically.

For Corporate L&D, you mentioned national reach indexed on corporate HQ cities. Given the ABM approach and longer B2B sales cycles, would you prefer to focus on the top 10-12 major corporate centers (NYC, SF, Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas) for concentrated account penetration, or does your sales process require broader geographic coverage to support existing prospect pipelines?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 11:
Excellent. You have a sophisticated geographic strategy: concentrated SF/Seattle/Austin for Career Changers, national with college town indexing for Gen Z, and 70/30 corporate HQ concentration for L&D.

Now for budget allocation across your three segments. With $5M total and 50,000 enrollments, each segment has different economics and geographic footprints.

Given your targeting precision requirements - concentrated tech hubs for Career Changers, national viral reach for Gen Z, and ABM for Corporate L&D - how would you initially allocate budget across these three segments? Equal thirds, or should one segment receive priority investment based on conversion potential or strategic importance?

Turn 13:
Excellent - "skill acceleration over credential accumulation" with immediate professional momentum. That's a compelling differentiation from traditional education.

Now let me adapt this core value prop to each segment's motivations:

Career Changers: "Transform your career in months, not years" - emphasizing speed and practical application over lengthy degree programs.

Gen Z: "Skip the debt, build the skills" - positioning against traditional college costs and time investment.

Corporate L&D: "Accelerate workforce capability, reduce hiring costs" - ROI-focused messaging about internal talent development.

Does this messaging framework align with how each segment responds to your value proposition, or would you adjust the emphasis for any of these audiences?

Turn 14:
Perfect. Your value proposition translates powerfully across all three segments.

Now we're ready for Step 7 - channel strategy. With your foundation locked in, I can recommend precise channel mixes for each segment:

**Career Changers ($2M, SF/Seattle/Austin):**
- LinkedIn Sponsored Content & InMail (40% - $800K): Research-driven professionals, precise geo-targeting
- Business/Tech Podcasts (30% - $600K): Aligns with their content consumption habits
- Search (20% - $400K): Capture long-tail career transition keywords
- Professional publication native content (10% - $200K): Thought leadership placement

**Gen Z ($1.5M, National):**
- TikTok creator partnerships (35% - $525K): Anti-establishment education narrative
- Instagram creator/influencer (25% - $375K): Mobile-first engagement
- YouTube pre-roll (20% - $300K): Broad reach for viral potential
- Snapchat/TikTok paid social (20% - $300K): Platform-native content

**Corporate L&D ($1.5M, 70/30 split):**
- LinkedIn ABM campaigns (40% - $600K): Decision-maker targeting
- Trade publication placements (25% - $375K): Industry credibility
- Programmatic display retargeting (20% - $300K): Extended nurture cycle
- Industry conference/webinar sponsorships (15% - $225K): Direct access to prospects

Does this channel architecture align with your segment strategies?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 12:
Smart allocation. Let me validate the efficiency math:

Career Changers: $2M ÷ 20,000 enrollments = $100 CAE
Gen Z: $1.5M ÷ 15,000 enrollments = $100 CAE  
Corporate L&D: $1.5M ÷ 15,000 enrollments = $100 CAE

Your allocation maintains the same $100 efficiency target across segments, which is strategically sound given their different value profiles and acquisition complexity.

With Career Changers getting 40% for concentrated tech hub penetration, Gen Z getting 30% for national viral reach, and Corporate L&D getting 30% for ABM precision, you have budget depth for the targeting sophistication each requires.

What's your core value proposition that differentiates EduPath from traditional education and other online learning platforms? This will drive our messaging strategy across the three distinct audience segments.

Turn 15:
Excellent - you can see how the channel architecture directly supports your market share expansion objectives across three distinct learner segments.

Now for Step 8 - measurement. Given your three different segments with varying sales cycles and attribution patterns, we need distinct measurement approaches:

**Career Changers:** Clean attribution possible through LinkedIn and search. Track enrollment conversion, but also leading indicators like whitepaper downloads and webinar attendance during their research phase.

**Gen Z:** Creator partnerships require different measurement - track engagement rates, share-through rates, and use promo codes for attribution. Platform-native content allows standard conversion tracking.

**Corporate L&D:** Longest attribution window needed. Track account engagement across touchpoints, demo requests, and sales-qualified leads rather than immediate enrollments.

What's your current measurement infrastructure? Do you have proper UTM tracking, CRM integration, and the ability to track longer B2B sales cycles, or do we need to build measurement capabilities alongside the media plan?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 16:
Perfect. Let's design measurement architecture that matches each segment's attribution complexity:

**Immediate Implementation:**
- Enhanced UTM taxonomy by segment (CC/GZ/CLD) and touchpoint sequence
- Promo code system for creator partnerships (Gen Z attribution)
- Lead scoring model for Corporate L&D's extended cycle

**90-Day Build:**
- Multi-touch attribution for Career Changers' research journey (LinkedIn → podcast → search)
- Social listening tools for Gen Z viral tracking beyond direct attribution
- Account-based measurement dashboard for Corporate L&D pipeline velocity

**Primary KPIs by Segment:**
- Career Changers: Cost per enrollment + research engagement score
- Gen Z: Blended cost per enrollment + viral coefficient tracking
- Corporate L&D: Cost per sales-qualified lead + pipeline conversion rate

Your current infrastructure handles the foundation. The enhancements will capture the sophisticated attribution these segments require.

For Step 9 - what's your biggest concern about testing and optimization across these three very different channel strategies?
