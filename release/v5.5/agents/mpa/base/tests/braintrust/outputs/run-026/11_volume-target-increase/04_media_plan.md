# Media Plan Output: Volume Target Increase

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've given me great detail to start! Let me analyze what you've shared:

**Your Numbers:**
- $400K budget ÷ 5,000 customers = $80 cost per customer
- Customer LTV of $320 means 4:1 return ratio

For home goods e-commerce, typical cost per customer runs $60-100, so your $80 target sits right in the sweet spot - ambitious but achievable.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 5,000 new customers? Are you focused on revenue growth, market share expansion, or something else?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect! Revenue growth through customer base expansion is clear. Let me update the projections:

**Revenue Impact:**
- 5,000 new customers × $320 LTV = $1.6M in customer value
- 35% sales increase suggests strong growth trajectory

Your primary KPI will be new customer acquisitions, measured as a number. With your $80 cost per customer target and $320 LTV, you're targeting a 4:1 return ratio.

One key question on the economics: Do you know what customers typically spend in their first purchase versus the $320 lifetime value? This helps us understand payback timing and cash flow.

Turn 3:
Excellent! That's a healthy first purchase range and strong repeat business model. Let me update our efficiency picture:

**Economics Check:**
- First purchase: $120-140 vs $80 acquisition cost
- Immediate payback: 1.5-1.75x (very healthy)
- Full LTV: 4x over 12-18 months

This is solid unit economics. Your immediate payback covers acquisition cost plus profit, and the long-term return is strong for e-commerce. The $80 cost per customer is definitely achievable given these fundamentals.

Moving to Step 3 - Audience. Who is your ideal customer? Can you describe the demographics and behaviors of your best-performing customers?

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Great audience definition! Design-conscious homeowners 30-55 with disposable income is a strong target. The Pinterest/Instagram behavior signals are valuable for channel planning later.

A few quick refinements to sharpen our targeting:

**Household Income:** What income range best describes your core customers? This affects media costs and channel efficiency.

**Geographic Concentration:** Do you see stronger performance in certain regions, or is demand fairly even across the US?

**Home Ownership vs Lifestyle Stage:** Are recent home buyers particularly valuable, or is it more about people in refreshing/upgrading mode regardless of when they bought?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Perfect! That income range ($85K-$150K) aligns well with your $120-140 first purchase behavior. The upgrade/refresh mindset is more sustainable than chasing just new home buyers.

**Audience Summary:**
- Homeowners 30-55, $85K-$150K income
- Design-conscious, quality-focused
- Upgrade/refresh mindset vs. move-in driven
- Strong social media engagement (Pinterest/Instagram)
- Metro concentration but national demand

Moving to Step 4 - Geography. Since you mentioned metro areas like Seattle, Denver, Austin, and Northeast perform slightly better, should we weight budget toward these stronger markets, or do you prefer even national distribution to test broader expansion?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 6:
Smart approach! 70/30 split balances optimization with growth discovery.

**Geography Plan:**
- 70% national: $280K for broad reach
- 30% metro focus: $120K in Seattle, Denver, Austin, Northeast
- Tests expansion potential while leveraging proven markets

**Updated Targets:**
- National: ~3,500 customers at $80 each
- Metro focus: ~1,500 customers with potentially better efficiency

Moving to Step 5 - Budget. You've allocated geography, but how do you want to split the $400K between acquisition channels versus retention/repeat purchase campaigns? Since your LTV model depends heavily on repeat business, some budget for existing customer reactivation might boost overall returns.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 7:
Excellent allocation! That 85/15 split prioritizes growth while protecting your LTV model.

**Budget Structure:**
- $340K acquisition (85%): Targets 4,250 new customers at $80 each
- $60K retention (15%): Drives repeat purchases to boost LTV
- **Gap Alert:** You need 5,000 customers but $340K only funds 4,250

You're 750 customers short of your 5,000 target. Two options: increase acquisition budget to $400K (no retention), or adjust target to 4,250 customers. Given your repeat-purchase model, the retention investment is smart.

Which direction makes more sense - prioritize the 5,000 customer target or maintain the retention budget?

Turn 8:
Let me update our projections. $340K acquisition budget ÷ 8,000 customers = $42.50 per customer. 

**Reality Check:**
Your target is now 47% more efficient than our $80 baseline. For home goods, $42.50 is extremely aggressive - typical runs $60-100. You'd be targeting the top 5% efficiency range.

**The Math:**
- 8,000 customers × $80 realistic cost = $640K needed
- Current acquisition budget: $340K  
- **Shortfall: $300K**

**Options:**
1. Increase total budget to ~$700K ($640K acquisition + $60K retention)
2. Target 4,250 customers with current budget (realistic)
3. Accept $42.50 efficiency target (requires perfect execution)

To hit 8,000 at $42.50, you'd need extremely tight targeting, premium creative, and likely some luck. What's leadership's flexibility on budget versus timeline?
