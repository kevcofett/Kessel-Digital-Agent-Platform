# Media Plan Output: Timeline Compression

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by calculating your implied efficiency. $1.2M ÷ 25,000 customers = $48 cost per customer. With $180 LTV, that's a 3.75x return - very strong for fashion retail where 2.5-3.5x is typical.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 25,000 new customers? Is this primarily about revenue growth, market share expansion, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect - revenue growth with market expansion is clear. Your $48 customer acquisition cost against $180 LTV gives you strong unit economics to fuel that growth.

For measuring success, what's your primary KPI? Are you tracking total revenue from these 25,000 customers, or is there another metric that best defines success for this campaign?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 4:
Great audience definition - urban professional women 25-45 who value versatile style. The social platform resonance is a strong signal for targeting precision.

A few quick questions to sharpen this: What income range defines "disposable income" for your brand? And when you say "urban" - are we talking major metros like NYC, LA, Chicago, or does this include mid-size cities too?

This will help us size the addressable market and assess if 25,000 customers is realistic within your target geography.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Excellent - so your primary KPI is total revenue from new customers, with CAC as your efficiency guardrail at $50.

Let me validate the math: 25,000 customers × $180 LTV = $4.5M total revenue target. At your $48 projected CAC, you're 4% under your $50 efficiency target, which gives you a small buffer.

Your economics look solid for Step 2. Fashion retail typically sees $45-65 CAC, so $48 is achievable but requires disciplined execution.

Ready to move to Step 3? What defines your target customer - who is the fashion-forward woman you're trying to reach?

Turn 5:
Perfect - $75K-$150K income in top 10 metros plus select Tier 2 cities gives us a well-defined target.

Let me size this quickly: Women 25-45 with $75K+ income in your target metros represents roughly 2.8-3.2M people. Your 25,000 target is less than 1% penetration, which is very realistic.

For Step 4 Geography: Do you want to split your 25,000 customers proportionally across all these markets, or do you have specific targets for Tier 1 vs Tier 2 cities? For example, 20,000 from major metros and 5,000 from expansion markets?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent split - 20,000 from core metros, 5,000 from Tier 2 test markets. That's a smart approach to balance proven performance with strategic expansion.

Let me update the budget allocation: 80% focus suggests roughly $960K for top metros ($48 CAC × 20,000) and $240K for Tier 2 testing ($48 CAC × 5,000). 

For Step 5 Budget: Does this geographic split align with how you want to allocate your $1.2M budget? Or do you want to invest more heavily in the Tier 2 markets initially to accelerate learning, even if it means higher CAC in those test markets?

Turn 7:
That's a significant timeline compression - let me recalculate immediately.

25,000 customers in 6 months = 4,167 customers per month vs 2,083 at the original pace. This doubles your required acquisition velocity.

The math still works: $1.2M ÷ 25,000 = $48 CAC holds. But the implications are serious:

- You'll need much more aggressive audience targeting from day one
- Platform learning phases must happen faster, requiring higher initial spend
- Creative fatigue will accelerate - you'll need 2-3x more creative assets
- Tier 2 market testing becomes riskier with less time to optimize

This is ambitious but achievable if we focus ruthlessly. Should we reallocate more budget to proven metro markets and reduce the Tier 2 test to minimize risk, or maintain the 80/20 split but with much tighter targeting?

Turn 8:
Absolutely - maintaining the 80/20 split with surgical precision is smart. You need to show strategic progress, not just retreat to safe markets.

For Step 6 Value Proposition: With this compressed timeline and dual-market strategy, your messaging needs to work immediately. What's your core value proposition that resonates with both metro professionals and Tier 2 expansion audiences? 

Is it "versatile professional style," "affordable luxury," or something else that bridges both markets? This will determine how tightly we can target and how quickly we can scale winning creative.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Perfect - "Effortless Style, Professional Edge" is strong universal messaging that translates across both markets. The lifestyle focus rather than specific looks gives you creative flexibility for rapid testing.

Moving to Step 7 Channels: With your 6-month timeline and need for rapid optimization, which channels are you currently using or considering? Given your audience's Instagram/TikTok engagement and the need for fast learning cycles, I'm thinking a focused digital approach - but what's your current channel mix or preferences?

Turn 12:
Excellent measurement framework - CAC, CVR, and total acquisition with channel-specific tracking methods. The unified dashboard approach is critical for your July presentation.

For Step 9 Testing: With 6 months to hit 25,000 customers, your testing needs to be rapid-fire. I'd recommend 2-week test cycles for creative and audience segments, with immediate budget reallocation to winners.

Key tests: Metro vs Tier 2 messaging variations, influencer content styles, and audience segments within your 25-45 professional women target. What's your appetite for risk in testing - are you willing to fail fast on 20-30% of spend to find the big winners, or do you need more conservative testing given the board pressure?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Smart channel focus - Instagram, TikTok, and Google Search gives you the speed and targeting precision you need for 6-month execution.

Let me map the strategy: Social platforms (Instagram/TikTok) for discovery and consideration, Google Search to capture intent. With your timeline pressure, I'd recommend:

- 60% social platforms ($720K) - split between Instagram and TikTok
- 25% Google Search ($300K) - capturing "professional clothing" and brand terms  
- 15% influencer partnerships ($180K) - authentic content creation

This prioritizes algorithm learning and rapid optimization. Does this allocation feel right, or would you shift more budget toward the influencer partnerships since they're already showing strong engagement?

Turn 11:
That math adds up to 115% - let me recalibrate. With $1.2M total budget:

- 55% social ads ($660K) - Instagram/TikTok paid targeting
- 25% Google Search ($300K) - intent capture  
- 20% influencer partnerships ($240K) - authentic content and credibility

This gives influencers the bigger role they've earned while keeping social ads as the primary driver. The 20% influencer investment makes sense for Tier 2 market credibility where you need that human connection to build brand awareness quickly.

For Step 8 Measurement: With this mix and your July deadline, what's your measurement approach? Are you tracking influencer performance differently than paid social, and how will you measure the combined impact across channels?

Turn 13:
Perfect - 25% experimental budget ($300K) with 10-day kill switches gives you aggressive discovery with smart risk management. 

For Step 10 Risks: Your biggest risks are timeline compression and dual-market execution. Key mitigation strategies:

- **Platform Learning Risk**: Front-load spend in proven metro markets while Tier 2 tests ramp
- **Creative Fatigue Risk**: Pre-produce 3x normal creative volume for rapid rotation
- **Attribution Lag Risk**: Weekly measurement reviews instead of monthly to catch issues early
- **Board Expectation Risk**: Build milestone check-ins at months 2, 4, and 6 to show progress trajectory

Your plan is ambitious but structured well. The 55% social ads, 25% search, 20% influencer split with geographic focus and rapid testing cycles should deliver your 25,000 customers. Ready to execute, or any final adjustments needed?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 14:
Perfect - you've built a comprehensive plan that balances ambition with execution discipline.

**Your Final Plan Summary:**
- **Target**: 25,000 customers in 6 months ($48 CAC, $4.5M revenue)
- **Geography**: 80% core metros (20K customers), 20% Tier 2 test (5K customers)
- **Budget**: 55% social ads ($660K), 25% search ($300K), 20% influencers ($240K)
- **Testing**: 25% experimental budget with 10-day performance gates
- **Measurement**: Unified dashboard tracking CAC, CVR, and acquisition by channel

For your July board narrative, you'll demonstrate three things: efficient customer acquisition at scale, successful market expansion learning, and a repeatable growth engine. The milestone check-ins at months 2, 4, and 6 will show trajectory toward your goals.

You're ready to execute. The plan is aggressive but achievable with the guardrails you've built in. Time to make Urban Essentials the go-to brand for professional women nationwide.
