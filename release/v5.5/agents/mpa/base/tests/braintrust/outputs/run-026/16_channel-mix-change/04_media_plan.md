# Media Plan Output: Channel Mix Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You mentioned awareness goals - what specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with this launch? Are you looking to drive trial purchases, build brand recognition for future sales, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect - trial purchases and retail credibility is a clear business objective. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success.

What's your primary KPI? Are you tracking number of trial purchases, total revenue from the launch, or something else as your main success metric?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - trial units sold is a measurable KPI that aligns with your retail credibility goals. 

What's your target number of trial units sold during the launch period? This will help me assess if your efficiency targets are realistic given your $3M budget.

Turn 4:
Let me run the math on your targets. $3M budget ÷ 500,000 units = $6 cost per trial unit sold. 

This is quite aggressive for CPG trial acquisition. Based on industry benchmarks, organic snack brands typically see $8-15 per trial unit when including full media costs. At $6, you're targeting 25-50% more efficiency than market typical.

This is ambitious but not impossible - it would require very tight audience targeting and strong conversion rates. To hit this efficiency, we'll need precise targeting of your highest-intent health-conscious families.

What's the retail price point for your organic snack packages?

Turn 5:
Got it - $4.99 retail price with $6 acquisition cost means you're spending 120% of product value to drive trial. This makes sense for a launch strategy focused on market credibility and retailer confidence.

For context, many successful CPG launches invest 100-150% of product value in trial acquisition, so you're within reasonable range. The key will be converting those trial customers into repeat purchasers post-launch.

Do you have data on your gross profit margin per unit, or should I model using typical organic snack benchmarks of 35-45% margin?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Perfect - I'll model at 40% gross margin, which gives you about $2.00 gross profit per $4.99 unit.

Let me validate the economics: At $6 cost per trial unit with $2.00 gross profit, you're investing 3x gross profit to acquire each trial customer. This confirms your launch strategy is about market penetration and retailer credibility rather than immediate profitability - which is smart for establishing a new product line.

Your efficiency target of $6 per trial unit is definitely aggressive but achievable with precise targeting. We'll need to focus on the highest-converting segments of health-conscious families.

Ready to move to Step 3 and define your target audience in detail?

Turn 7:
Great foundation - 25-54, $75K+ income, organic interest gives us a solid starting point. To hit your aggressive $6 efficiency target, we need to layer in more precision.

Beyond demographics, what behavioral signals identify your highest-intent families? For example, do they shop at specific retailers, buy certain product categories, follow particular brands, or engage with health/wellness content?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
This is a significant constraint that affects our efficiency targets. Meta and TikTok typically offer the most precise behavioral targeting at scale - exactly what we need for your aggressive $6 per trial unit goal.

Without social platforms, we'll rely on Google, programmatic display, connected TV, and potentially traditional channels. These can still work but generally have higher CPMs and less granular targeting, which may push your cost per trial unit toward $8-10 range.

Before we adjust targets, let me understand your behavioral targeting better. Do your highest-intent families shop at specific retailers like Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, or Target? Or engage with particular health/wellness brands or content categories?

Turn 9:
Perfect - those behavioral signals give us strong targeting options even without social platforms.

For Google, we can target searches around organic snacks, clean eating, and specific health/wellness terms. For programmatic display, we can target visitors to Well+Good, nutrition sites, and fitness content. Connected TV lets us reach them during health/wellness programming.

The Whole Foods/Sprouts shopping behavior is particularly valuable - we can use retail data partnerships and lookalike modeling based on organic grocery purchasers.

How geographically concentrated are these premium organic shoppers? Are you seeing stronger performance in specific regions like West Coast, Northeast metros, or is it truly distributed nationally?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 11:
Perfect - the 60/40 geographic allocation gives us a clear framework to optimize efficiency where it matters most while supporting your retail strategy.

Now for budget allocation within that $3M. You mentioned this is for a three-month launch period. How do you want to distribute that budget - evenly across the three months, or do you need heavier investment in specific periods to align with retail launches or seasonal shopping patterns?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Smart approach - concentrating 60% of media spend in high-intent markets while maintaining national presence for retail support makes strategic sense.

Let me calculate the geographic impact: If we allocate 60% of your $3M budget ($1.8M) to those concentrated markets and 40% ($1.2M) nationally, we can achieve much more efficient targeting in your core regions while still building the national awareness retailers want to see.

In your high-concentration markets, we could potentially hit that $6 per trial unit target. In broader national markets, we'd likely see $8-10 per unit, but that's acceptable for the retail credibility benefit.

Does this 60/40 geographic split align with your distribution strategy and retail partnership goals?

Turn 12:
Excellent - the 30/50/20 distribution perfectly aligns with your retail launch timing. Month 1 builds awareness, Month 2 drives trial during Whole Foods launch, and Month 3 sustains momentum.

Let me calculate your monthly budgets:
- Month 1: $900K (awareness building)
- Month 2: $1.5M (retail launch support) 
- Month 3: $600K (momentum sustain)

This front-loaded approach should create strong trial velocity right when Whole Foods buyers are watching performance metrics.

Now let's talk value proposition. What's your key message to health-conscious families? Is it the organic quality, specific health benefits, taste, convenience, or a combination that differentiates you from other premium snacks?
