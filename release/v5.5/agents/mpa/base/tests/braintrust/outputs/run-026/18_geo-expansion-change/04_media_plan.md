# Media Plan Output: Geography Expansion Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by understanding your business outcome. You mentioned wanting 500,000 store visits and online conversions combined. Is your primary goal customer acquisition, or are you also focused on brand awareness and consideration among active adults?

Turn 2:
Perfect - customer acquisition with revenue growth as the primary outcome. 

For measuring success, what's your main KPI? Are you tracking:
- New customers acquired (the 500,000 visits/conversions)
- Revenue generated from new customers
- Or another specific metric?

I want to make sure we're optimizing toward the number that matters most for your business goals.

Turn 3:
Got it - new customer acquisition is your primary KPI with 500,000 as your target volume. Revenue generation is the secondary focus ensuring those customers are valuable.

Let me run the basic math on your efficiency target: $2.5M ÷ 500,000 = $5 per customer acquisition. 

For athletic apparel, that's extremely aggressive. Industry benchmarks typically run $25-60 for new customer acquisition in this category. At $5, you're targeting 80-90% better efficiency than market standard.

This is ambitious but not impossible - it would require very precise targeting and high-converting experiences. 

Before we strategize how to achieve this, what's the typical value of a new customer to ActiveWear Pro? Understanding customer value helps determine if this efficiency target makes business sense.

Turn 4:
No problem. I'll model using industry benchmarks for athletic apparel which suggest customer lifetime value of $450-650 based on typical repeat purchase patterns. You can adjust this anytime.

Using $550 LTV as our baseline: at your $5 acquisition cost, you'd achieve a 110:1 LTV to acquisition ratio - exceptionally strong unit economics that justify aggressive acquisition.

However, that $5 target remains very challenging. To hit it, we'd need extremely efficient targeting and likely a mix of owned channels (email, social) with paid media.

Moving on, let's define your audience more precisely. You mentioned active adults 25-45. To build targeting that can achieve $5 efficiency, what specific behaviors or interests define "active" for your ideal customers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 2: Economics

Turn 5:
Excellent - performance-driven fitness enthusiasts who invest in quality gear. That's a strong behavioral foundation.

To hit your aggressive $5 acquisition target, I need two more targeting dimensions:

**Behavioral triggers**: What typically prompts them to buy new athletic apparel? New training program, seasonal sport transition, gear replacement, or specific events like race prep?

**Media consumption**: Where do they spend time online? Fitness apps like Strava or MyFitnessPal, training content on YouTube, specific fitness influencers, or performance-focused communities?

These signals help platforms find the right people within that committed fitness demographic and improve our efficiency toward that $5 target.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 6:
Perfect - that gives us strong behavioral and contextual signals. Research-driven fitness enthusiasts with seasonal purchase patterns and heavy digital engagement.

For geography, you mentioned the US market. With your $5 efficiency target, are you planning nationwide reach, or would you prefer to focus on specific regions or metro areas where ActiveWear Pro has stronger brand presence or better conversion rates?

Concentrating geographically often improves efficiency, especially with aggressive targets like yours.

Turn 8:
Perfect. Let me calculate the budget allocation:

- US: $1.75M for 350,000 customers = $5.00 per customer
- Canada: $500K for 100,000 customers = $5.00 per customer  
- Mexico: $250K for 50,000 customers = $5.00 per customer

Your efficiency target remains consistent across markets, but Canada will be challenging since acquisition costs typically run 15-20% higher there. Mexico may offer some efficiency advantages to help balance this.

Now let's define your value proposition. For performance-driven fitness enthusiasts who research their gear purchases, what makes ActiveWear Pro stand out from competitors like Lululemon, Under Armour, or Athleta? 

Understanding your unique positioning helps craft messaging that converts efficiently toward that $5 target.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 7:
Let me update our projections. Adding Canada and Mexico expands your addressable market but changes efficiency dynamics.

$2.5M across three countries for 500,000 customers still equals $5 per customer, but now we're spreading that across different market maturity levels and cost structures.

Canada typically runs 15-20% higher acquisition costs than US due to smaller scale. Mexico can be more efficient but may have different customer value patterns. This means your US efficiency needs to be even better than $5 to offset higher costs in Canada.

For allocation, are you thinking roughly 70% US, 20% Canada, 10% Mexico based on market size and your distribution strength? Or do you have different priorities for the country split?

Turn 10:
Excellent - that allocation gives us the foundation to hit your targets.

Now for channels. With your research-driven audience and technical positioning, I recommend this mix for your $1.5M acquisition budget:

**Search (40% - $600K)**: Capture high-intent research behavior when they're evaluating gear
**Meta (30% - $450K)**: Target fitness enthusiasts on Instagram with performance-focused creative  
**YouTube (20% - $300K)**: Reach them in fitness content with technical demonstrations
**Influencer partnerships (10% - $150K)**: Leverage trusted fitness authorities for credibility

This prioritizes channels where your technical messaging can demonstrate value to serious athletes doing research.

For your brand building budget, we'd focus on YouTube and influencer content that showcases the science behind your gear.

Does this channel mix align with where you see your customers spending time and researching purchases?

Turn 11:
Perfect! Now for measurement. Given your $5 acquisition target and technical positioning, I recommend tracking:

**Primary KPIs:**
- New customer acquisitions by channel and geography
- Customer acquisition cost (actual vs. $5 target)
- Revenue per new customer (to validate LTV assumptions)

**Secondary KPIs:**
- Brand awareness lift among target fitness enthusiasts
- Technical performance messaging recall
- Cross-border performance (Canada/Mexico vs. US efficiency)

**Key measurement approach:** Use incrementality testing to validate true acquisition impact, especially important with your aggressive efficiency targets. Platform-reported numbers often inflate results.

For testing strategy, what's most important - optimizing creative messaging around technical benefits, or testing audience precision within that performance-driven segment?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 9:
Strong positioning - scientifically engineered performance for serious athletes. That technical differentiation should resonate well with your research-driven audience.

For your $2.5M budget allocation, how much flexibility do you have? I'm thinking:

- 60% ($1.5M) for customer acquisition across all three markets
- 25% ($625K) for brand building to support that technical positioning
- 15% ($375K) as optimization reserve for responding to performance data

This balance lets us drive immediate acquisition while building the brand authority that serious athletes expect from premium technical gear. The reserve helps us shift budget toward what's working best.

Does this allocation align with your growth priorities, or would you prefer a different split between acquisition and brand building?

Turn 13:
Excellent strategic thinking - prioritizing efficiency over volume protects your unit economics and forces optimization discipline.

**Your Complete Media Plan Summary:**

**Outcomes:** 500,000 new customer acquisitions (flexible down to maintain $5 efficiency)
**Economics:** $5 target CAC with $550 estimated LTV (110:1 ratio)
**Audience:** Performance-driven fitness enthusiasts, research-oriented, sport-specific segments
**Geography:** US (70%), Canada (20%), Mexico (10%)
**Budget:** $2.5M total - 60% acquisition, 25% brand building, 15% optimization reserve
**Channels:** Search (40%), Meta (30%), YouTube (20%), Influencer (10%)
**Measurement:** New customer CAC by segment, incrementality testing, cross-border performance
**Testing:** 2-week audience precision sprints, sport-specific targeting optimization
**Risk Management:** Volume flexibility to maintain efficiency targets

This plan balances aggressive growth with disciplined efficiency. Your technical positioning and research-driven audience approach should help achieve that challenging $5 target through precision rather than scale.

Ready to execute, or any final adjustments needed?

Turn 14:
Excellent! You're set up for success with a plan that prioritizes precision over volume - exactly the right approach for your aggressive efficiency targets.

**Next Steps for Execution:**
1. Set up tracking infrastructure for incrementality measurement across all three markets
2. Launch first 2-week sprint with $30-45K testing marathon/endurance vs. CrossFit/strength vs. yoga/flexibility segments
3. Prepare creative assets showcasing technical performance benefits for each sport vertical
4. Establish weekly performance reviews to identify efficiency winners quickly

Your focus on audience precision testing will be crucial for cracking that $5 acquisition cost. The combination of technical positioning, research-driven targeting, and disciplined budget management gives you a strong foundation.

Great work building this plan together - you've grown more strategic about the connection between audience precision and efficiency targets. That insight will serve you well as you scale ActiveWear Pro's customer acquisition.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 12:
Smart approach - audience precision is critical for hitting that $5 target.

For testing, I recommend:

**Audience Precision Tests:**
- Sport-specific segments: Marathon/endurance vs. CrossFit/strength vs. yoga/flexibility
- Training intensity: Competitive athletes vs. dedicated enthusiasts vs. consistent fitness maintainers
- Purchase triggers: Seasonal gear replacement vs. new training program adoption vs. performance upgrade seeking

**Test structure:** Run 2-week sprints with $10-15K per audience segment to identify efficiency winners, then reallocate budget toward top performers.

Finally, let's address risks. Your biggest risk is the aggressive $5 efficiency target in a category where $25-60 is typical. If early tests show $8-12 acquisition costs, would you prefer to:
- Reduce volume targets to maintain budget, or
- Request additional budget to hit volume goals?

Having this decision framework ready prevents delays when optimization data comes in.

Turn 15:
Perfect! You're thinking like a true performance marketer - getting analytics and creative aligned from day one is exactly right.

That kickoff meeting will be crucial for ensuring everyone understands the precision testing approach and efficiency targets. Make sure your analytics team knows we need segment-level CAC tracking and your creative team understands the sport-specific messaging requirements.

You've built a solid strategic foundation here. The real value will come from how quickly you can iterate based on those first sprint results. Your willingness to prioritize efficiency over volume gives you the flexibility to optimize without pressure.

Looking forward to hearing how those initial audience tests perform. You've got all the pieces in place to crack that $5 acquisition target through smart targeting rather than just scale.
