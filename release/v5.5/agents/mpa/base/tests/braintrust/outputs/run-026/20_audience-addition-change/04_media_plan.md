# Media Plan Output: Audience Addition Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've given me excellent detail upfront. Let me model what you've shared:

**Your targets:** $2M budget ÷ 5,000 leads = $400 cost per lead. With $15K LTV, that's a 37.5x return - very strong economics for wealth management.

I have your objective (qualified leads) and volume target (5,000). To complete Step 1, what's your primary success metric? Is it total qualified leads, or do you track conversion to clients, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect. So your primary KPI is qualified leads with $1M+ AUM potential, targeting 5,000 leads.

Let me update the economics: At $400 cost per lead and $15K LTV per client, you need about a 3% lead-to-client conversion rate to break even ($400 ÷ $15K = 2.7%). 

For wealth management targeting HNW individuals, this is conservative - the industry typically sees 5-15% conversion on well-qualified leads based on my benchmarks.

Your efficiency target looks very achievable. The $400 cost per lead is reasonable for this audience, and your conversion economics provide strong cushion.

Step 1 complete. Moving to economics - do you have data on your typical lead-to-client conversion rate, or should I model using industry benchmarks around 8-10% for this segment?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent. At 8% conversion, your economics look strong:

5,000 leads × 8% = 400 new clients
400 clients × $15K LTV = $6M revenue
$6M revenue ÷ $2M investment = 3x return

Your $400 cost per lead translates to $5,000 cost per client ($400 ÷ 8%), which is outstanding efficiency for wealth management where industry benchmarks typically run $8K-$15K per client.

This gives you room to invest in premium targeting and channels that reach your HNW audience effectively. The strong unit economics support higher-quality, potentially higher-cost media placements.

Step 2 complete. Moving to audience definition - you mentioned 55+ individuals with $1M+ investable assets approaching retirement. Beyond age and assets, what behavioral or lifestyle signals indicate someone is actively considering wealth management services?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Perfect signals. Those behavioral indicators - life transitions, retirement planning content engagement, financial calculator downloads, and investment education consumption - are excellent for identifying in-market prospects.

Let me capture your audience definition:
- **Demographics:** 55+ with $1M+ investable assets
- **Life stage:** Approaching/in retirement or major transition
- **Behavioral signals:** Career milestone activity, financial planning research, retirement calculator usage, investment content engagement

This audience typically represents 2-4% of the total 55+ population in wealth markets, which gives us good targeting precision without being too narrow.

Step 3 complete. Moving to geography - you mentioned the top 30 wealth markets. Do you have a specific list of DMAs you want to target, or should I recommend the standard wealth management markets based on HNW population density?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Based on HNW concentration and wealth management performance, here are the top 30 markets I'd recommend:

**Tier 1 (Premium):** San Francisco, New York, Boston, DC, Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago
**Tier 2 (Strong):** Miami, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, Denver, Phoenix, Minneapolis, Philadelphia
**Tier 3 (Emerging):** Austin, Nashville, Charlotte, Raleigh, San Diego, Tampa, Portland, Salt Lake City

**Tier 4 (Secondary):** Orlando, Las Vegas, Kansas City, Cincinnati, Columbus, Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, St. Louis

The markets you mentioned - SF Bay, NYC, Boston, Chicago, Miami - are all in my top recommendations. These five alone represent about 35% of US HNW population.

For budget allocation, I'd suggest 60% to Tier 1 markets where your cost per lead may be higher but conversion quality is typically stronger.

Would you prefer to focus on fewer markets with deeper investment, or spread across all 30 for broader reach?

Turn 6:
Excellent strategic thinking. Focusing on Tiers 1-2 with that allocation maximizes your ROI potential.

**Geographic allocation:**
- **Tier 1 (60% = $1.2M):** SF, NYC, Boston, DC, LA, Seattle, Chicago
- **Tier 2 (40% = $800K):** Miami, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, Denver, Phoenix, Minneapolis, Philadelphia

This gives you 15 premium markets representing roughly 65% of US HNW population. At these investment levels, you'll have meaningful presence to optimize performance in each market.

Step 4 complete. Moving to budget structure - with your $2M total budget, how do you want to allocate between lead generation and brand awareness? Wealth management typically benefits from some upper-funnel investment to build trust before prospects are ready to engage.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Smart allocation. The 70/30 split recognizes that HNW prospects need both immediate capture and longer-term trust building.

**Budget breakdown:**
- **Lead generation (70% = $1.4M):** Direct response, search, lead magnets
- **Brand awareness (30% = $600K):** Thought leadership, brand content, trust-building

This gives you $280 per lead for direct acquisition ($1.4M ÷ 5,000) while investing $600K in brand equity that should improve conversion rates over time. The brand investment should help lift your conversion above that 8% target.

For your value proposition, HNW individuals typically respond to expertise demonstration rather than sales pitches. What's your core differentiator - is it specialized retirement planning, tax optimization, estate planning, or comprehensive wealth management approach?

Turn 8:
This changes everything strategically. You now have two distinct audiences with different behaviors, channels, and messaging needs. Let me reframe our approach.

**Dual-audience implications:**
- **Retirees (55+, $1M+):** Wealth preservation, risk management, retirement income
- **Emerging affluent (30-45, $250K-$1M):** Wealth building, growth, inheritance planning

Key questions to resolve:
1. **Lead allocation:** How do you want to split the 5,000 leads between these segments?
2. **LTV difference:** Is the $15K LTV the same for both, or does it vary by segment?
3. **Conversion rates:** Will your 8% conversion apply to both audiences?

These segments require different channels, messaging, and likely different costs per lead. The younger segment may be cheaper to reach but have lower immediate conversion, while retirees cost more but convert faster.

What's your target split between the two audiences for the 5,000 total leads?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Perfect segmentation. Let me model both audiences:

**Retiree segment (3,500 leads):**
- Budget allocation: ~$1.4M (70% of $2M)
- Cost per lead: $400
- Conversion: 8% = 280 clients
- LTV: $15K = $4.2M revenue
- Cost per client: $5,000

**Emerging affluent (1,500 leads):**
- Budget allocation: ~$600K (30% of $2M) 
- Cost per lead: $400
- Conversion: 5.5% = 83 clients  
- LTV: $10K = $830K revenue
- Cost per client: $7,227

**Combined economics:** 363 total clients, $5M revenue, 2.5x return

Both segments show strong ROI, though retirees are more efficient. Your channel instincts are spot-on - LinkedIn/podcasts for younger professionals, financial media/webinars for retirees.

For value proposition, do you plan separate messaging frameworks, or one adaptable approach that speaks to wealth building vs. wealth preservation?

Turn 10:
Excellent messaging differentiation. You've captured the core emotional drivers perfectly.

**Value proposition framework:**
- **Retirees:** Security-focused messaging around wealth preservation, peace of mind, retirement confidence
- **Emerging affluent:** Growth-focused messaging around wealth acceleration, strategic opportunity, building legacy
- **Brand bridge:** Personalized expert guidance across both journeys

This dual-track approach will require segment-specific creative, landing pages, and lead magnets. Retirees likely respond to retirement income calculators and estate planning guides, while younger prospects want investment strategy content and wealth-building tools.

Step 6 complete. Moving to channels - given your audience split and messaging needs, you'll need a multi-channel approach. For the retiree segment targeting traditional financial media, and LinkedIn/digital audio for emerging affluent, what's your comfort level with managing 6-8 different channel strategies simultaneously?
