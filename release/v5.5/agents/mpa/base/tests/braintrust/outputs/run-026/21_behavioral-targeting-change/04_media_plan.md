# Media Plan Output: Behavioral Targeting Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've given me great detail upfront. Let me capture what I heard: acquire 50,000 new subscribers with $800K budget, targeting fitness enthusiasts 25-55 nationwide, with $420 LTV.

Let me calculate your implied efficiency: $800K ÷ 50K subscribers = $16 cost per customer (CAC). With $420 LTV, that's a 26:1 LTV:CAC ratio - extremely strong unit economics.

For subscription nutrition, typical CAC runs $25-45 based on industry benchmarks. Your $16 target is 36-64% more efficient than market norms. This is aggressive but achievable with precise targeting.

What specific business outcome drives this subscriber acquisition goal? Is it revenue growth, market expansion, or something else?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect. Revenue growth through subscriber acquisition targeting serious amateur athletes and weekend warriors - that's a clear objective.

Now I need to understand how you'll measure success. You mentioned 50K new subscribers as the target volume. What's your primary KPI - the main number you'll track to know if this campaign is working? 

For example, is it total new subscribers acquired, monthly recurring revenue added, or something else?

Turn 3:
Excellent. So your primary KPI is new subscriber acquisition (50K target), with monthly recurring revenue as a critical secondary metric focusing on subscriber quality and retention.

You've defined the complete picture for Step 1: revenue growth objective, 50K subscriber target, and quality-focused measurement approach.

Now for Step 2 - Economics. You mentioned $420 LTV, which gives us that strong 26:1 ratio at your $16 CAC target. 

To assess if this efficiency is realistic, I need to understand your subscriber economics better. What's the average monthly subscription value, and do you have a sense of how long subscribers typically stay active?

Turn 4:
Perfect. Let me validate your economics: $39/month × 10.5 months average = $409.50 LTV, which aligns closely with your $420 figure.

At $16 CAC with $420 LTV, you're targeting a 26:1 ratio. For subscription businesses, healthy ratios typically run 3:1 to 5:1, with excellent performance at 8:1+. Your target is exceptionally strong unit economics.

However, your $16 CAC is 36-64% below typical nutrition subscription benchmarks of $25-45. This is aggressive but achievable given your strong LTV. The key will be precise targeting of serious amateur athletes who convert efficiently.

Your retention opportunity is significant - if you can extend average lifespan from 10.5 to 13+ months through better engagement, your LTV grows to $500+, making acquisition even more profitable.

Economics look solid with the efficiency challenge noted. Ready to move to Step 3 - defining your audience more precisely than "fitness enthusiasts 25-55"?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Excellent insight. Serious endurance athletes are a much higher-intent audience than general fitness enthusiasts - that precision targeting is exactly what you need to hit your aggressive $16 CAC.

Let me capture what you've outlined: triathletes, marathon runners, and long-distance cyclists who take training seriously. These are athletes investing in performance optimization, not casual exercisers.

To build a complete audience profile, what behavioral signals help you identify these serious endurance athletes? For example, do they follow specific training programs, participate in events, use certain apps or gear, or engage with particular content?

Turn 6:
Perfect. You're building a highly qualified audience with clear intent signals.

Let me summarize your audience definition:
- Primary: Triathletes, marathon runners, long-distance cyclists
- Behavioral signals: Strava users, registered for organized events (IRONMAN, Boston Marathon qualifiers)
- Content engagement: Follow pro athletes/coaches, consume training content, gear reviews, performance optimization
- Mindset: Performance-focused, willing to invest in training support

This precision targeting should absolutely support your aggressive $16 CAC - these aren't casual fitness enthusiasts, they're committed athletes with proven spending behavior.

For audience sizing, this represents roughly 2-4% of the general fitness population. In your 25-55 age range nationally, we're looking at approximately 1.5-3 million targetable individuals.

Ready to move to Step 4 - Geography? Will you focus this nationally, or are there specific markets where endurance sports are more concentrated?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Excellent refinement! Marathon runners actively training for races is much more precise than our earlier definition. This focused targeting should significantly improve your conversion efficiency.

Let me update the audience profile:
- Primary: Marathon runners actively preparing for races
- Behavioral signals: Registered for upcoming marathons, active Strava users, recent running gear purchases, consuming marathon training content
- Intent level: High - actively training with specific race goals

This is a much smaller but higher-converting audience. Marathon runners preparing for races represent roughly 0.3-0.5% of your original 25-55 fitness population - so about 300,000-500,000 targetable individuals nationally instead of 1.5-3 million.

Smaller audience but dramatically higher intent. This precision targeting strongly supports hitting your aggressive $16 CAC since these athletes are actively seeking performance nutrition during training cycles.

The tradeoff: you'll need to expand this core audience or add secondary segments to reach your full 50K subscriber goal, since this focused group may not provide sufficient scale alone.

Ready to discuss geography, or do you want to define additional audience segments first?

Turn 8:
Perfect strategy. You're balancing precision with scale intelligently.

Updated audience framework:
- **Primary**: Marathon runners actively training for races
- **Secondary**: Long-distance cyclists and triathletes with similar performance focus
- **Combined scale**: Approximately 800K-1.2M targetable individuals nationally

Geographic concentration in major marathon markets is smart - these metros have 3-5x higher concentrations of serious endurance athletes compared to national average.

Let me validate the math: Your 50K subscriber target from ~1M targetable audience requires 5% market penetration. That's aggressive but realistic given the high intent and your strong value proposition for performance nutrition.

The metro focus (NYC, Chicago, Boston, SF) represents about 25% of US population but likely 40-50% of your target audience. This concentration should improve efficiency and support your $16 CAC target.

Ready for Step 5 - Budget allocation? We'll need to discuss how to distribute your $800K across these geographic markets and audience segments.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Excellent positioning. "Training partner, not just nutrition" resonates perfectly with serious athletes who view every element as part of their performance system.

Your value proposition hits three critical athlete pain points:
- **Sustained energy**: Addresses bonking/hitting the wall fears
- **Faster recovery**: Enables consistent high-volume training
- **Reduced muscle fatigue**: Direct competitive advantage

The sports science backing differentiates you from generic brands and appeals to these data-driven athletes who research everything they put in their bodies.

This positioning strongly supports your aggressive $16 CAC - performance-focused athletes pay premium for proven competitive advantages, and your clinical research provides the credibility they demand.

Your messaging framework is solid for converting high-intent marathon runners actively seeking performance optimization during training cycles.

Ready for Step 7 - Channels? Given your audience of tech-savvy, research-driven endurance athletes concentrated in major metros, we'll want to identify the most efficient platforms to reach marathon runners, cyclists, and triathletes where they're actively consuming training content.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Smart allocation strategy. Let me break down your budget distribution:

- NYC & Chicago: $320K (40%) - $160K each
- Boston: $200K (25%) 
- San Francisco: $160K (20%)
- Testing/flex budget: $120K (15%)

This weighting makes strategic sense. NYC and Chicago offer the largest addressable markets for endurance athletes. Boston has exceptional marathon culture but smaller scale. SF has high-income athletes but premium competition.

The 15% flex budget is particularly smart - it allows you to double down on outperforming markets or test expansion into secondary metros like Austin, Denver, or Seattle where endurance sports are growing.

Quick efficiency check: At your $16 CAC target, this translates to roughly 10K subscribers from NYC, 10K from Chicago, 12.5K from Boston, 10K from SF, and 7.5K from testing markets to hit your 50K total.

Boston's allocation yields the highest subscriber density per dollar, which aligns with their marathon concentration.

Ready for Step 6 - Value Proposition? How will you position EnduraFuel specifically to these performance-focused marathon runners and endurance athletes?

Turn 11:
Excellent channel strategy. You've identified the three platforms where serious endurance athletes actively engage with performance content.

Let me suggest allocation based on your audience and efficiency targets:

**Instagram/YouTube (50% - $400K)**: Highest volume reach for performance content consumption. Target athletes following coaches, pro athletes, training channels. Strong creative opportunities to demonstrate sports science backing.

**Strava (30% - $240K)**: Highest intent targeting - active training athletes with behavioral proof. Premium CPMs but exceptional conversion potential for your $16 CAC target.

**Endurance Podcasts (20% - $160K)**: Engaged, loyal audiences during long training sessions. Host-read ads from trusted voices build credibility for science-backed positioning.

This mix balances scale (Instagram/YouTube) with precision (Strava) and credibility (podcasts). All three channels support your "training partner" positioning through valuable content rather than interruption advertising.

The key will be creating content that educates about performance nutrition science rather than generic supplement promotion - exactly what these research-driven athletes expect.

Ready for Step 8 - Measurement? We'll need to track both acquisition efficiency and subscriber quality across these channels to optimize toward your MRR goals.

Turn 13:
Excellent testing framework. You're building systematic optimization around the core question: what messaging converts serious endurance athletes into long-term subscribers.

**Creative Testing Priority**:
- **Performance science vs. emotional journey**: Critical for your sports science positioning
- **Elite vs. weekend warrior personas**: Different motivation triggers for same audience
- **Deep science vs. conversational podcast reads**: Credibility vs. relatability balance

**Testing Structure**:
- Week 1-2: Launch baseline creative variants
- Week 3-4: Early conversion data + first retention signals
- Week 5-6: Pivot based on quality metrics, not just CAC
- Month 2: Scale winning combinations, test new variants

**Key Success Metrics**: 
- 30-day retention by creative variant (quality indicator)
- Engagement depth (serious athletes research thoroughly)
- Subscription upgrade rates (commitment signal)

Your nimble approach is essential - this precise audience will quickly signal what resonates. The combination of systematic testing with rapid iteration should optimize both efficiency and subscriber quality.

Ready for Step 10 - Risk assessment? We'll identify potential challenges with your aggressive targeting and efficiency goals, plus mitigation strategies.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 12:
Absolutely. Granular measurement is critical for optimizing toward high-quality subscribers rather than just volume.

Your measurement framework should include:

**Channel-Specific Metrics**:
- CAC by channel and creative/placement
- First-month retention rate by source
- Initial order value (indicates commitment level)
- 90-day LTV by acquisition channel

**Quality Indicators**:
- Subscription upgrade rates (serious athletes often upgrade)
- Engagement with training content/community features
- Repeat purchase timing (consistent training cycles)

**Dashboard Structure**:
- Real-time CAC tracking vs $16 target
- Channel LTV comparison (some channels may justify higher CAC)
- Cohort retention curves by source
- MRR contribution by channel over time

**Critical Insight**: Strava-acquired subscribers may have $25 CAC but $500+ LTV due to higher commitment. Instagram might hit $15 CAC but $350 LTV. The dashboard should surface these efficiency vs. quality tradeoffs.

This measurement approach lets you optimize for true subscriber value, not just acquisition cost - exactly what you need to hit both volume and MRR goals.

Ready for Step 9 - Testing strategy? We'll want systematic approaches to improve both targeting precision and creative performance.

Turn 14:
Excellent risk identification. Let me map out the key risks and mitigation strategies:

**AUDIENCE SCALE RISK**
- Risk: 800K-1.2M targetable audience may not yield 50K subscribers at $16 CAC
- Early warning: CAC rising above $20 by month 2
- Mitigation: Pre-planned audience expansion to ultrarunners, obstacle racers, or serious recreational athletes with similar performance mindsets

**COMPETITIVE PRESSURE RISK** 
- Risk: Established brands (Gatorade, UCAN, Maurten) targeting same high-intent athletes
- Early warning: CPMs increasing 20%+ or conversion rates declining
- Mitigation: Double down on sports science differentiation, potentially increase budget for winning channels

**EFFICIENCY DEGRADATION RISK**
- Risk: $16 CAC target proves unsustainable as you scale
- Early warning: Quality subscribers acquired at $25+ CAC
- Mitigation: Shift to LTV-optimized bidding, accept higher CAC for proven high-retention subscribers

**MARKET SATURATION RISK**
- Risk: Major metros reach saturation faster than expected
- Mitigation: Your 15% flex budget enables rapid expansion to secondary markets (Austin, Denver, Seattle)

Your sports science positioning is indeed your strongest defense against competitive pressure. Lean into clinical research credibility - it's harder to replicate than marketing spend.

Your media plan is now complete with clear execution roadmap and risk mitigation strategies.
