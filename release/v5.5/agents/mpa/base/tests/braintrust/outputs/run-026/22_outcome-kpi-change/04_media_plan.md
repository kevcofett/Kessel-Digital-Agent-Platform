# Media Plan Output: Outcome KPI Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

Let me start by calculating your efficiency target. $5M ÷ 25,000 policies = $200 per acquisition. With $2,800 LTV, that's a 14:1 LTV-to-CAC ratio - very strong for insurance where 8-12:1 is typical.

Your objective is clear: 25,000 new policy acquisitions. What's the primary KPI you'll use to measure success? Is it simply policy count, or do you track a specific metric like qualified leads that convert to policies?

Turn 2:
Perfect. Your primary KPI is total new policies issued, with qualified leads as your leading indicator. That 14:1 LTV-to-CAC ratio gives you excellent efficiency headroom.

Let me validate the economics. At $200 cost per policy with $2,800 LTV, you're targeting strong unit economics. For insurance, this is conservative - many successful campaigns run 8-12:1 ratios, so you have room for optimization.

What's your average conversion rate from qualified lead to issued policy? This helps me understand how many leads we need to generate to hit your 25,000 policy target.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent. At 15-18% conversion, you need 139,000-167,000 qualified leads to hit 25,000 policies. Using your midpoint of ~150,000 leads, that's $33 per qualified lead ($5M ÷ 150,000).

For insurance lead generation, $33 per qualified lead is very achievable - industry benchmarks typically run $25-50 for homeowner insurance leads depending on geography and competition.

Your economics are solid and realistic. Now let's define your audience more precisely. You mentioned homeowners 35-65 with $100K+ income during life events. Which of these life events converts best for you currently - home purchase, new baby, or pre-retirement? This will help us prioritize our targeting strategy.

Turn 4:
That's valuable insight. Home buyers at 22% conversion versus 12-15% for other life events means we should prioritize recent home purchasers as your primary audience.

At 22% conversion for home buyers, you'd need ~114,000 qualified leads from this segment versus 167,000 from mixed life events - that's 32% fewer leads needed for the same policy volume.

For audience precision, how recent does the home purchase need to be for optimal conversion? Are we targeting people who bought in the last 30 days, 90 days, or longer? And what's your current data source for identifying recent home buyers - do you have access to deed records, mortgage data, or are you relying on platform signals?

Turn 5:
Perfect. The 60-90 day window gives us a precise targeting timeframe, and your mix of deed records plus platform signals provides strong audience precision.

Let me model the audience implications. Recent home buyers (60-90 days) in your income bracket represent roughly 2-4% of your total addressable market versus 15-20% for broader life events. This tighter audience will drive higher efficiency but may limit scale as you optimize.

With your strong first-party data advantage, this audience strategy supports your aggressive efficiency targets well.

Now for geography - are you targeting specific states, regions, or going national? Insurance regulations and competition vary significantly by state, which affects both your targeting strategy and cost efficiency.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Great. National coverage with emphasis on high-growth markets is smart given your existing policy concentration and demographic alignment.

Let me structure this geographically for optimal planning. I'll create a DMA-level breakdown focusing on your priority markets:

**GEOGRAPHY PLAN - PHASE 1**

| DMA | Total Population | Target Audience Size | Target Audience % |
|-----|-----------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **TEXAS** | | | |
| Dallas-Ft Worth | 7,900,000 | 85,000 | 1.1% |
| Houston | 7,200,000 | 78,000 | 1.1% |
| Austin | 2,500,000 | 32,000 | 1.3% |
| San Antonio | 2,600,000 | 28,000 | 1.1% |
| **Texas Subtotal** | 20,200,000 | 223,000 | 1.1% |
| **CALIFORNIA** | | | |
| Los Angeles | 13,200,000 | 125,000 | 0.9% |
| San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose | 7,800,000 | 95,000 | 1.2% |
| San Diego | 3,300,000 | 32,000 | 1.0% |
| **California Subtotal** | 24,300,000 | 252,000 | 1.0% |
| **FLORIDA** | | | |
| Miami-Ft Lauderdale | 6,200,000 | 58,000 | 0.9% |
| Tampa-St Pete | 3,200,000 | 35,000 | 1.1% |
| Orlando-Daytona Beach | 3,800,000 | 38,000 | 1.0% |
| **Florida Subtotal** | 13,200,000 | 131,000 | 1.0% |
| **SOUTHEAST** | | | |
| Atlanta | 6,100,000 | 72,000 | 1.2% |
| Charlotte | 2,800,000 | 35,000 | 1.3% |
| Nashville | 2,000,000 | 26,000 | 1.3% |
| **Southeast Subtotal** | 10,900,000 | 133,000 | 1.2% |
| **REST OF US** | 265,400,000 | 1,761,000 | 0.7% |
| **NATIONAL TOTAL** | 334,000,000 | 2,500,000 | 0.7% |

This gives you ~2.5M target audience nationally, with 739,000 in your priority markets. Does this geographic concentration align with your current policy distribution?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Excellent - the geographic alignment validates our targeting strategy. With 739,000 prospects in priority markets representing 30% of your national audience, we can allocate budget efficiently.

Now let's establish your budget allocation framework. With $5M total budget, I recommend this initial split:

**BUDGET ALLOCATION BY GEOGRAPHY**
- Priority Markets (TX, CA, FL, SE): $3.0M (60%)
- National/Other Markets: $1.5M (30%) 
- Testing & Optimization Reserve: $500K (10%)

This concentrates investment where you have proven performance while maintaining national presence and flexibility for optimization.

What's your current understanding of customer acquisition costs across these different geographic markets? Do you see meaningful CAC variations between Texas versus California, or is performance fairly consistent across your priority regions?

Turn 8:
That's a significant strategic shift. Let me recalibrate our entire plan around this new brand awareness objective.

Your new primary KPI is 15% brand awareness lift in your target demographic. This completely changes our economics - we're no longer optimizing for $200 CAC but rather cost-per-awareness point.

For insurance brand campaigns, achieving 15% awareness lift typically requires 8-12 reach points against your target audience over 8-12 weeks, depending on creative strength and competitive noise.

With your competitor launching simultaneously, you'll need higher frequency to break through. Industry benchmarks suggest 15-20% budget premium in competitive situations.

What's your current baseline brand awareness level in the target demographic? And do you have a timeline for achieving this 15% lift - is this a 3-month sprint or 6-month build?

Turn 9:
Perfect. Moving from 35% to 50% awareness in 6 months with competitive pressure is achievable but requires strategic focus.

For insurance, achieving 15 percentage point awareness lift typically requires 60-80 gross rating points (GRPs) per month against your target demographic. With competitive interference, plan for the higher end - roughly 80 GRPs monthly.

Your $5M budget over 6 months gives us strong reach potential. For context, 80 monthly GRPs against 2.5M target audience typically costs $600K-800K monthly depending on channel mix.

Since you mentioned positive brand perception alongside awareness, what specific brand attributes are most important to defend against this competitor? Trust, value, customer service, or something else? This shapes whether we emphasize reach for broad awareness or frequency for message reinforcement.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 11:
Perfect. A 60-40 traditional-digital split aligns well with trust-building objectives for your demographic. Traditional media provides the credibility foundation while digital enables precision targeting and frequency optimization.

**RECOMMENDED CHANNEL MIX**

**Traditional (60% - $3M)**
- Broadcast TV: $1.8M (36%) - Prime credibility driver
- Cable TV: $600K (12%) - Targeted reach efficiency  
- Radio: $400K (8%) - Local market reinforcement
- Print: $200K (4%) - Professional/financial publications

**Digital (40% - $2M)**
- Connected TV: $800K (16%) - Premium digital environment
- Social Video: $600K (12%) - Testimonial amplification
- Display/Native: $400K (8%) - Educational content
- Search: $200K (4%) - Defensive brand protection

This mix prioritizes video storytelling for trust-building while maintaining targeted efficiency. Connected TV bridges traditional credibility with digital precision.

What's your creative asset situation - do you have existing trust-focused creative, or do we need to factor production into this budget?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Excellent. Trust-building requires sustained messaging and credible touchpoints - this shifts our strategy toward channels that build authority rather than just reach.

For insurance trust-building, effective campaigns typically emphasize:
- Financial stability messaging (AM Best ratings, years in business)
- Customer testimonials during actual claims
- Educational content positioning you as the expert advisor
- Consistent presence across credible media environments

Trust campaigns require 3-4 months minimum to show measurable perception shifts, so your 6-month timeline is realistic.

Now for budget allocation. With trust as the primary message and competitive defense as the goal, we need channels that deliver both reach and credibility. Traditional media often outperforms digital for trust-building in insurance.

What's your current media mix preference - are you open to significant TV investment for credibility, or do you need to stay primarily digital? This affects both our channel strategy and budget efficiency.

Turn 12:
Good planning. $250-300K for trust-focused creative is reasonable for broadcast-quality production. That leaves us $4.7-4.75M in working media budget.

Let me adjust our channel allocation:

**REVISED BUDGET WITH CREATIVE**
- Creative Production: $275K
- Working Media: $4.725M

**CHANNEL ALLOCATION ($4.725M)**
- Broadcast TV: $1.7M (36%)
- Connected TV: $750K (16%) 
- Cable TV: $565K (12%)
- Social Video: $565K (12%)
- Radio: $380K (8%)
- Display/Native: $380K (8%)
- Search (Defensive): $190K (4%)
- Print: $190K (4%)

For measurement, brand awareness requires survey-based tracking. Do you have an existing brand tracking study in market, or do we need to establish baseline measurement? This typically requires $50-75K over 6 months for reliable tracking against your awareness lift goal.

Turn 13:
Excellent. Enhanced tracking will be crucial for optimizing against your competitor. Let me finalize the measurement allocation:

**FINAL BUDGET ALLOCATION**
- Creative Production: $275K
- Enhanced Brand Tracking: $65K  
- Working Media: $4.66M

This gives us strong measurement capability to track both awareness lift and competitive positioning shifts throughout the 6-month campaign.

For testing strategy, I recommend A/B testing two message approaches within your trust framework:
1. **Heritage Focus**: "Protecting homeowners for 40+ years" 
2. **Expertise Focus**: "When experience matters most"

We can split-test these across connected TV and social video to optimize message resonance before scaling to broadcast.

What are your biggest concerns about this plan? Competitive response, message breakthrough, budget efficiency, or timeline execution? Understanding your primary risk will help us build appropriate contingencies.

Turn 15:
Perfect. 24-hour approval cycles and pre-authorized emergency funding give you excellent competitive agility. Your board's commitment to defending market position is exactly what's needed.

**FINAL MEDIA PLAN SUMMARY**

**Objective**: Increase brand awareness from 35% to 50% (15-point lift) over 6 months while defending against competitive entry

**Budget**: $5M total
- Working Media: $4.66M
- Creative Production: $275K  
- Enhanced Tracking: $65K

**Channel Strategy**: 60/40 Traditional/Digital for credibility
- Broadcast TV leads for authority building
- Connected TV bridges traditional credibility with precision
- A/B testing optimizes trust messaging

**Competitive Defense**: 
- $500K emergency reserve activated within 24 hours
- Daily spend monitoring with weekly tracker pulses
- Pre-negotiated vendor relationships for rapid scale

**Success Metrics**: 15% awareness lift with maintained/improved trust perception vs. competitor

This plan positions you to proactively defend while building sustainable awareness. You're ready to launch and respond dynamically to competitive pressure. Any final questions before implementation?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 14:
Smart concern. Competitive response capability is critical when facing well-funded market entrants. Let me outline a proactive defense framework:

**COMPETITIVE RESPONSE STRATEGY**

**Early Warning System (Weeks 1-4)**
- Daily competitive spend monitoring via Pathmatics/MediaRadar
- Weekly brand tracker pulse surveys for competitive mention trends
- Social listening for brand sentiment shifts
- Trigger: If competitor outspends by 2:1 or awareness gaps narrow by 5+ points

**Rapid Response Protocol (48-72 hours)**
- $500K emergency reserve for immediate scale-up
- Pre-negotiated rate protection with key TV/CTV vendors
- Creative variants ready for deployment
- Message testing results inform immediate pivots

**Quarterly Reallocation Reviews**
- Shift budget from underperforming channels to high-impact vehicles
- Geographic reallocation based on competitive pressure by DMA
- Message optimization based on A/B test winners

Your biggest advantage: established relationships and rate efficiencies vs. their premium new-entrant pricing.

What's your decision-making timeline if we need to activate emergency budget or pivot messaging? Same-day, 24-hour, or longer approval cycles?
