# Media Plan Output: Audience Removal Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You've given me great initial details. Let me clarify your primary business outcome: Are you optimizing for test drive volume (15,000 drives) or for actual vehicle sales that result from those drives?

The distinction matters because it affects how we measure success and allocate budget across your three segments.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Perfect. So test drives are your primary KPI with sales conversion as the ultimate goal. 

Let me calculate the efficiency target: $4M ÷ 15,000 test drives = $267 per test drive.

For automotive test drives, industry benchmarks typically run $150-$400 depending on vehicle price point. At $267, you're in a reasonable range for EV launches, though on the higher end.

What's the approximate price point of your new EV? This helps me assess whether $267 per test drive aligns with realistic conversion economics.

Turn 3:
Got it. For premium EVs in the $55-65K range, $267 per test drive is actually quite reasonable - potentially even conservative. Tesla and other premium EV brands often see $300-500+ per qualified test drive.

I'll model using industry benchmarks: premium auto typically converts test drives to sales at 15-25%. At your price point with solid margins, even 15% conversion ($55K × 15% = ~$8,250 gross value per test drive) would justify $267 acquisition cost.

This suggests your efficiency target is achievable. You can refine these economics anytime as you get more precise data.

Now let's move to your audience strategy. You mentioned three segments: eco-conscious early adopters, luxury German sedan switchers, and tech enthusiasts. Which of these three segments do you expect will be most responsive to test drive offers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Excellent insight. Tech enthusiasts as your most responsive segment makes strategic sense - they're typically eager to experience new technology firsthand.

Let me understand the size and priority across your three segments. If you had to allocate your 15,000 test drive target across the three groups, what would be your ideal split?

For example: 40% tech enthusiasts, 35% luxury switchers, 25% eco-conscious? This helps determine budget allocation and targeting precision needed for each segment.

Turn 5:
Perfect. That gives us:
- Tech enthusiasts: 6,750 test drives (45%)
- Luxury switchers: 4,500 test drives (30%) 
- Eco-conscious: 3,750 test drives (25%)

This allocation makes sense given tech enthusiasts' higher responsiveness. The split allows you to lean into your strongest segment while maintaining meaningful volume across all three.

Now let's define your geography more precisely. You mentioned California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Washington. Are you thinking state-level campaigns, or do you want to focus on specific metro areas within those states?

For EV launches, metro-level targeting often performs better due to charging infrastructure and demographic concentration.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Excellent metro selection. Those markets have strong EV adoption rates and align perfectly with your segments - especially Silicon Valley and Seattle for tech enthusiasts, NYC/LA for luxury switchers.

Let me now calculate your budget allocation. With $4M across 7 metros targeting 15,000 test drives:

**By Segment:**
- Tech enthusiasts: $1.8M (6,750 drives)
- Luxury switchers: $1.2M (4,500 drives) 
- Eco-conscious: $1.0M (3,750 drives)

**By Metro** (rough allocation based on market size):
- SF Bay/Silicon Valley: ~$1.2M (largest tech concentration)
- LA: ~$800K
- NYC: ~$700K
- Seattle: ~$500K
- Austin: ~$400K
- Miami: ~$400K

Does this geographic weighting feel right, or would you adjust the metro priorities? For example, should we weight Austin higher given Texas's EV incentives?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Great call. Austin's tech boom and Texas EV incentives make it a high-opportunity market. Let me adjust:

**Revised Metro Allocation:**
- SF Bay/Silicon Valley: $1.1M 
- LA: $800K
- NYC: $700K
- Austin: $550K (increased from $400K)
- Seattle: $450K
- Miami: $400K

This gives Austin more firepower to capture that emerging EV adoption while maintaining strong presence in your core markets.

Now let's develop your value proposition for each segment. Starting with your strongest - tech enthusiasts: What are the 2-3 most compelling technology features that would motivate them to book a test drive? Think about what they can't experience through online research alone.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
Smart decision. Focusing on two segments with $4M will give you much stronger market penetration and clearer messaging.

Let me recalculate with just eco-conscious early adopters and luxury switchers:

**New Target Split:**
- Luxury switchers: 9,000 test drives (60%) = $2.4M
- Eco-conscious: 6,000 test drives (40%) = $1.6M

This gives you $267 per test drive for each segment - same efficiency but with deeper budget to dominate these audiences.

**Key Benefits:**
- Stronger frequency and reach within each segment
- Clearer, more focused messaging per audience
- Better optimization budget for learning and scaling

Does a 60/40 split toward luxury switchers feel right, or would you prefer different weighting between these two segments?

Turn 9:
Perfect adjustment. Luxury switchers at your price point definitely justify the heavier weighting.

**Final Allocation:**
- Luxury switchers: 9,750 test drives (65%) = $2.6M
- Eco-conscious: 5,250 test drives (35%) = $1.4M

Still $267 per test drive, but now you have $2.6M to really dominate the luxury switching audience across your metros.

Now let's define your value propositions. For luxury switchers coming from German sedans, what are the 2-3 most compelling reasons they should test drive your EV instead of sticking with their current brand loyalty?

Think about what overcomes the "why switch?" barrier for someone currently driving BMW, Audi, or Mercedes.
