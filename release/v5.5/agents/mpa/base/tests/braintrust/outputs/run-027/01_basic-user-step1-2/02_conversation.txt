TURN 1 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
Hi! I'm looking to get more people to buy shoes from our online store. Can you help me figure out the best way to do that?

AGENT:
Hi! I'm excited to help you grow your shoe sales. We'll work through ten key areas together: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last to create your best plan.

Let's start with what matters most - what specific business outcome are you trying to achieve? For example, are you looking to get more new customers, increase sales from existing customers, or boost overall revenue?

TURN 2 (Step 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
I want to get more new customers buying our shoes online. Right now, we're mostly selling to people who already know about us, but I want to expand and reach more people who might not have heard of StepRight Shoes before.

AGENT:
You want to acquire new customers for StepRight Shoes - that's clear. Based on Knowledge Base, ecommerce typically tracks new customer acquisition through metrics like Cost Per Acquisition (CAC), conversion rate, and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS).

How many new customers are you targeting over the next 3-6 months?

TURN 3 (Step 1)

USER:
I'm not totally sure about exact numbers. Maybe around 5,000 new customers? We haven't set a firm target yet, but that seems like a good goal for expanding our reach. Our online store has been doing okay, but we really want to grow beyond our current customer base.

AGENT:
Got it, I'll model using 5,000 new customers as your target. Based on Knowledge Base, typical ecommerce CAC is $20-80. You can adjust anytime.

Step 1 complete with Objective: new customer acquisition, KPI: new customers, Target: 5,000. Now Step 2 Economics.

With 5,000 customers, we need to check if this is realistic. What's your total budget for getting these new customers?

TURN 4 (Step 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER:
We have about $250,000 to spend on marketing this year. I'm hoping that will help us reach those 5,000 new customers, but I'll be honest - I'm not totally sure how far that budget will go.

AGENT:
Perfect. With your $250K budget and 5,000 customer target, that's $50 per customer acquisition cost. Based on Knowledge Base, typical ecommerce CAC is $20-80, so your target sits right in the sweet spot.

This is realistic and achievable. Your efficiency target aligns well with industry benchmarks, giving us room to optimize across channels.

Step 2 complete. Your $50 CAC target is achievable based on Knowledge Base benchmarks.

Now let's talk audience. Who is your ideal new customer for StepRight Shoes?
