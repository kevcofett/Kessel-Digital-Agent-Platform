# Media Plan Output: Full 10-Step Media Planning

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Your $50 CAC target is right in the sweet spot. Based on Knowledge Base, typical ecommerce CAC is $20-80, so this is very achievable.

What specific business outcome are you trying to drive with these 15,000 new customers?

Turn 2:
Excellent. With $450 LTV and $50 CAC, your 9:1 ratio is strong. Based on Knowledge Base benchmarks, healthy ecommerce LTV:CAC ratios typically range 3:1 to 8:1, so you're well-positioned for profitable growth.

Step 1 complete with revenue growth objective, new customer acquisition KPI, and 15,000 customer target. Now Step 2 Economics.

What's your average order value for new customers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Perfect. With $185 AOV and $450 LTV, that implies 2.4 purchases per customer over their lifetime. Based on Knowledge Base benchmarks, healthy ecommerce repeat purchase rates typically range 20-40%, so your customer retention looks solid.

Your economics check out: $50 CAC against $450 LTV gives you 9x return. This target is achievable.

Step 2 complete. Your efficiency target is realistic based on strong unit economics.

Who is your ideal customer for these home decor purchases?

Turn 4:
Your targeting is precise and well-defined. Based on Knowledge Base, homeowners 30-55 with household income $60K+ interested in home decor reaches approximately 2.1M people nationally. That's excellent scale for your 15,000 customer target.

What geographic markets are you focusing on - national, specific regions, or metro areas?

Turn 5:
Smart geographic focus. Based on Knowledge Base, your target audience in top 20 DMAs is approximately 1.5M people - still excellent scale for 15,000 acquisitions without oversaturation.

Step 3 complete with homeowner audience 30-55, $60K+ income. Step 4 complete with top 20 metro focus.

With your $750K budget and 15,000 customer target, how do you want to allocate spend across the year?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Your seasonal allocation is spot-on. Based on Knowledge Base benchmarks, home decor typically sees 35-45% of annual sales in Q4, so your 40% weight aligns perfectly with consumer behavior patterns.

Your Q2 spring emphasis at 25% is smart - that's peak home refresh season. The remaining split gives you steady presence year-round.

What's your value proposition that differentiates HomeStyle from other home decor retailers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Excellent value proposition - curated collections that work together is a strong differentiator. The interior design consultation adds real value and justifies premium positioning.

Step 5 complete with seasonal budget allocation. Step 6 complete with coordinated design value proposition.

Based on Knowledge Base benchmarks for home decor ecommerce, your strongest channel mix typically includes paid social for visual products, search for high-intent shoppers, and display for retargeting. With your $750K budget, we can fund 3-4 channels effectively.

What channels have you used before, and which performed best for customer acquisition?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 8:
Your channel experience aligns perfectly with industry patterns. Based on Knowledge Base benchmarks, Google search typically delivers the highest conversion rates for home decor while social platforms like Facebook/Instagram excel at volume and visual engagement.

Your display struggles are common - often targeting or creative issues rather than channel viability. For home decor, display works best for retargeting website visitors.

Given your performance data, I recommend 50% search, 35% social, 15% display retargeting. This leverages your proven channels while fixing display execution.

What's your current monthly spend split between Google and Facebook/Instagram?

Turn 9:
Perfect insight. Based on Knowledge Base benchmarks, your current 60% social/40% search split is actually backwards for optimal efficiency. Home decor campaigns typically see search CACs 20-40% lower than social due to higher purchase intent.

With your proven $14K monthly search performance, scaling to $31K (50% of $62.5K monthly) should maintain efficiency while significantly boosting volume.

Your social channels stay strong at $22K monthly but focus on upper-funnel awareness to feed search demand.

How comfortable are you with this reallocation, and do you have capacity constraints on either platform?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 10:
Smart concern about search capacity. Based on Knowledge Base benchmarks, home decor campaigns can typically support 3-5x current keyword volume through expanded product categories, seasonal terms, and long-tail variations. Your current $14K likely covers core terms - scaling to $31K opens room for broader match types and shopping campaigns.

Step 7 complete with 50% search, 35% social, 15% display allocation.

For measurement, what's most important - tracking individual channel performance, overall ROAS, or customer lifetime value?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 10: Risks

Turn 11:
Perfect focus on LTV measurement. Based on Knowledge Base, successful home decor campaigns track LTV by channel using 90-day cohort analysis. This reveals which channels attract repeat buyers versus one-time customers.

Recommended measurement framework: 7-day click attribution for immediate ROAS, plus 90-day LTV cohorts by channel. Search typically shows 20-30% higher LTV due to purchase intent, while social excels at customer volume.

Step 8 complete with LTV-focused measurement approach.

What testing priorities matter most - creative variations, audience segments, or budget allocation experiments?

Turn 12:
Excellent priorities. Based on Knowledge Base, creative testing is critical for home decor where visual appeal drives engagement. Recommend testing 4-6 creative variants monthly, focusing on lifestyle imagery showcasing your curated collections.

For audience expansion, lookalike testing typically yields 15-25% efficiency gains when based on high-LTV customer segments.

Step 9 complete with creative-first testing approach.

What's your biggest concern that could derail this plan?
