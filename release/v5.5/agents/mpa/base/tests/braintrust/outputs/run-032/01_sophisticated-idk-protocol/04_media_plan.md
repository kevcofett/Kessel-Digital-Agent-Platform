# Media Plan Output: Sophisticated User - IDK Protocol

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You mentioned acquiring 10,000 new users this quarter - that's a clear volume target. What's the primary business outcome you're trying to achieve beyond user acquisition (revenue growth, market share expansion, geographic expansion, etc.)?

Turn 2:
Perfect - revenue growth through higher transaction volume is your objective, with user acquisition as the KPI targeting 10,000 new users. 

With your $500K budget targeting 10,000 users, that's $50 per user acquisition. My estimate for fintech CAC typically ranges $80-150, so your target is aggressive but achievable with tight execution.

What's your target timeline to hit these 10,000 users - is this spread across the full quarter or do you need them by a specific date?
