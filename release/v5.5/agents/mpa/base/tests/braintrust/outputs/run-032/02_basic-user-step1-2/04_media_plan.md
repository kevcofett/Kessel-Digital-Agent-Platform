# Media Plan Output: Basic User - Steps 1-2 Completion

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What business outcome are you trying to achieve - are you looking to increase total sales, attract new customers, or get existing customers to buy more frequently?

Turn 2:
Great! Increasing total sales for StepRight gives us a clear direction. Now I need to understand how you'll measure success.

For growing online shoe sales, you could track different metrics - total revenue growth, number of new customers acquired, or number of shoes sold. Which metric matters most to you, and do you have a specific target in mind for the next 6-12 months?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it, I'll model using a 35% monthly growth target. Based on Knowledge Base, ecommerce brands typically see sustainable growth rates of 20-40% when scaling with media, so your instinct is spot-on.

Step 1 complete with Objective: Increase total sales, KPI: Monthly revenue growth, Target: 35% increase. Now Step 2 Economics.

To hit 35% growth, we need to understand your unit economics. What does it typically cost you to get one new customer right now, and what's the average value of a first shoe purchase?
