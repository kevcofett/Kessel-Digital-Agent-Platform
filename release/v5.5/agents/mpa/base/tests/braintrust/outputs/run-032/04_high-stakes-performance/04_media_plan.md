# Media Plan Output: High-Stakes Performance Campaign

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You mentioned acquiring 50,000 new merchants with $850 LTV (Lifetime Value) - that's a clear volume target. Before we dive into the economics, I need to understand the business outcome driving this growth.

What specific business outcome are you trying to achieve with these 50,000 new merchants?

Turn 2:
Perfect. Step 1 complete with Objective: $42.5M new ARR, KPI: new merchant acquisitions, Target: 50,000 merchants. Now Step 2 Economics.

With your $2M budget and 50,000 target, that's $40 CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) per merchant. Given your $850 LTV, that's a 21:1 LTV:CAC ratio - extremely efficient. My estimate for fintech CAC typically ranges $80-200, so your target is quite aggressive.

This efficiency requires either exceptional organic conversion rates or highly precise targeting to minimize waste.

What's your current merchant acquisition CAC from existing channels?

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Your current $125 CAC is realistic - my estimate for B2B fintech typically ranges $100-250. Moving from $125 to $40 requires a 68% efficiency improvement, which is ambitious but achievable with programmatic precision.

Step 2 complete. Your $40 target is aggressive but your 21:1 LTV:CAC ratio provides excellent margin for testing. The path to efficiency is tight targeting in expansion markets where competition may be lower.

Now for Step 3 Audience. You mentioned smaller markets beyond metro footprint. What defines your ideal merchant beyond geography - business size, transaction volume, or industry verticals?

Turn 4:
Good demographics start. You've defined business size ($10K-$100K monthly transactions) and verticals (contractors, professional services, retail). With your aggressive $40 CAC, we need behavioral precision beyond firmographics.

What triggers these businesses to switch payment processors - growth spurts requiring better infrastructure, compliance issues with current provider, or seasonal cash flow problems needing better terms?

Turn 5:
Excellent - cash flow triggers and payment speed pain points give us behavioral precision. These businesses actively seek solutions during growth phases or when processing costs squeeze margins.

With your $40 CAC target, this precision helps but programmatic B2B inventory for these segments can run $15-25 CPMs. The targeting paradox: tighter behavioral signals increase conversion but reduce inventory scale.

What's your current platform mix beyond LinkedIn and Google - are you open to programmatic display, connected TV, or other channels for reaching these businesses?

Turn 6:
Perfect audience definition with cash flow triggers as behavioral layer. Step 3 complete.

Now Step 4 Geography. You mentioned expansion into smaller markets beyond current metro footprint. Based on Knowledge Base, small business owners processing $10K-$100K monthly transactions represent approximately 6.0% of the business population nationally.

Which specific markets are you targeting for expansion - secondary DMAs like Austin, Nashville, or smaller metros under 1M population?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Based on Knowledge Base, small businesses processing $10K-$100K monthly transactions represent approximately 6.0% of the business population in secondary metros. Here's your target market sizing:

| DMA | Business Population | Target Audience | Target % |
|-----|-------------------|-----------------|----------|
| Austin | 125K | 7,500 | 6.0% |
| Raleigh | 95K | 5,700 | 6.0% |
| Salt Lake City | 80K | 4,800 | 6.0% |
| **TOTAL** | **300K** | **18,000** | **6.0%** |

Your 50,000 target across 18,000 addressable businesses requires 278% market penetration - mathematically impossible. Either expand geography significantly or adjust volume expectations.

What's your flexibility on either target volume or geographic scope?

Turn 8:
Expanding to six markets improves your math significantly:

| DMA | Business Population | Target Audience | Target % |
|-----|-------------------|-----------------|----------|
| Austin | 125K | 7,500 | 6.0% |
| Raleigh | 95K | 5,700 | 6.0% |
| Salt Lake City | 80K | 4,800 | 6.0% |
| Charlotte | 110K | 6,600 | 6.0% |
| Denver | 140K | 8,400 | 6.0% |
| Phoenix | 160K | 9,600 | 6.0% |
| **TOTAL** | **710K** | **42,600** | **6.0%** |

Your 50,000 target now requires 117% penetration - still aggressive but achievable if you include adjacent verticals. Based on Knowledge Base, expanding to healthcare services, food service, and home services could add 30-40% more addressable businesses.

Should we model with broader vertical scope or adjust to 42,600 realistic target?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Perfect. Based on Knowledge Base, expanding to healthcare services, food service, and home services typically increases addressable audience by 35-40%. Here's your updated sizing:

| DMA | Business Population | Target Audience | Target % |
|-----|-------------------|-----------------|----------|
| Austin | 125K | 10,500 | 8.4% |
| Raleigh | 95K | 8,000 | 8.4% |
| Salt Lake City | 80K | 6,700 | 8.4% |
| Charlotte | 110K | 9,200 | 8.4% |
| Denver | 140K | 11,800 | 8.4% |
| Phoenix | 160K | 13,400 | 8.4% |
| **TOTAL** | **710K** | **59,600** | **8.4%** |

Step 4 complete. Your 50,000 target now requires 84% market penetration - ambitious but realistic with strong execution.

Step 5 Budget. You have $2M total. How do you want to allocate between brand building for market awareness and performance marketing for direct acquisition?
