# Media Plan Output: Mass National Campaign - Simplicity Test

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

You mentioned driving awareness for your national snack launch with brand lift measurement. For Step 1, I need to get specific about your target. Brand awareness campaigns typically aim for reach metrics like total impressions, unique reach, or frequency caps.

What specific awareness outcome are you targeting - is it reach (like "reach 50M adults 3+ times") or a brand lift metric (like "increase unaided awareness by 15%")?

Turn 2:
Perfect. Step 1 complete with Objective: National awareness, KPI: Unique reach, Target: 50M adults with 3+ frequency. Now Step 2 Economics.

With your $8M budget targeting 50M adults at 3+ frequency (150M total impressions), that's roughly $53 CPM. My estimate for national brand awareness campaigns typically runs $35-65 CPM depending on channel mix, so your efficiency target is realistic.

Your $8M budget provides solid scale for broad reach across multiple channels. National TV, digital video, and programmatic display can all deliver at this efficiency level.

Do you have any internal efficiency targets or cost-per-reach goals from previous campaigns that should guide our planning?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it, I'll model using industry benchmarks for CPG brand awareness. Based on Knowledge Base, CPG snack campaigns typically achieve $40-60 CPM for broad national reach, putting your $53 target right in the realistic range. 

Step 2 complete. Your $53 CPM target is achievable for national snack awareness.

Now Step 3 Audience. You mentioned adults 18-54 who buy snacks - that's roughly 140M people nationally. But high-performing campaigns define audiences beyond demographics. For snacks, behavioral triggers matter: frequent snackers versus occasional, health-conscious versus indulgent, workplace versus home consumption.

What behavioral patterns or snacking occasions should we prioritize for FreshBite's positioning?

Turn 4:
Excellent - health-conscious, on-the-go professionals is much more precise than broad demographics. Based on Knowledge Base, this audience represents approximately 6.0% of US adults, or roughly 15M people nationally.

This creates an interesting precision versus scale consideration. Your 50M reach target is 3x larger than your core audience. We can either:
1. Expand beyond core audience to hit 50M (includes casual snackers)
2. Adjust reach target to focus on your 15M core audience with higher frequency

With your $53 CPM, reaching all 50M adults means broader targeting and some efficiency trade-off. Focusing on 15M core audience would allow 10+ frequency for deeper impact.

Which approach aligns better with your launch strategy - maximum breadth or focused impact on core audience?

Turn 5:
Perfect - maximum breadth for launch awareness makes strategic sense. Based on Knowledge Base, your expanded snack buyer audience (adults 18-54 who buy snacks) represents approximately 140M people nationally, which aligns with your 50M reach target at 36% penetration.

Your targeting expands from 15M health-conscious professionals to 140M general snack buyers. This broader approach sacrifices some precision but maximizes trial opportunity for a new brand launch.

Now Step 4 Geography. For national reach of 50M adults, we need to prioritize DMAs by efficiency and scale. Top 25 DMAs typically deliver 65% of national reach at lower CPMs than smaller markets.

Should we weight spending toward major metros for efficiency, or do you need even distribution across all markets for retail support?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Got it - even distribution to support national retail. Here's your audience sizing by top DMAs for 50M reach target:

| DMA | Total Population | Target Audience | Target % |
|-----|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| New York | 20.1M | 1.21M | 6.0% |
| Los Angeles | 13.2M | 792K | 6.0% |
| Chicago | 9.5M | 570K | 6.0% |
| Philadelphia | 7.4M | 444K | 6.0% |
| Dallas-Ft Worth | 7.4M | 444K | 6.0% |
| San Francisco | 6.8M | 408K | 6.0% |
| Boston | 4.9M | 294K | 6.0% |
| Washington DC | 4.9M | 294K | 6.0% |
| Atlanta | 4.6M | 276K | 6.0% |
| Houston | 4.1M | 246K | 6.0% |
| **Top 10 DMAs** | **82.9M** | **4.97M** | **6.0%** |
| **All 210 DMAs** | **330M** | **83.3M** | **6.0%** |

Based on Knowledge Base, your target audience represents 6.0% of total population. To reach 50M adults, you'll need coverage across all 210 DMAs with proportional spend allocation.

Does this geographic distribution align with your retail rollout priorities?

Turn 7:
Perfect. Step 4 complete with national DMA coverage supporting retail rollout. Now Step 5 Budget.

With your $8M budget and 210 DMA coverage, that's approximately $38K average per DMA. Based on Knowledge Base, brand awareness campaigns typically allocate 60-70% to broad reach channels (TV, video), 20-30% to digital awareness, and 10-20% to support channels.

For FreshBite's national snack launch, this suggests roughly $5.6M for TV/video reach, $2M for digital awareness, and $400K for search support. This allocation maximizes your 50M reach target while maintaining efficiency.

Does this budget framework align with your media expectations, or do you have preferences for traditional versus digital weighting?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 8:
Excellent. Step 5 complete with $8M allocation: $5.6M TV/video, $2M digital awareness, $400K search support.

Now Step 6 Value Proposition. For brand awareness, your message hierarchy determines creative effectiveness. Based on Knowledge Base, CPG awareness campaigns need clear category entry points - when consumers think "healthy snack," you want them to think "FreshBite."

Your better-for-you positioning for busy lifestyles suggests messaging around convenience without compromise. Primary message could be functional benefit (nutrition + taste), secondary could be situational (workplace, post-workout energy).

What's your core brand promise that should anchor all creative - is it the nutritional superiority, the taste experience, or the lifestyle fit?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 9:
Perfect. Step 6 complete with core promise: nutrition without sacrificing taste. Now Step 7 Channels.

Based on Knowledge Base, brand awareness campaigns allocate 60-70% to broad reach (TV, video), 20-30% to digital awareness, 10-20% to support. Your $8M breakdown fits this framework perfectly.

For FreshBite's taste-focused positioning, I recommend:
- **TV/Video ($5.6M)**: National TV + connected TV for broad reach
- **Digital Awareness ($2M)**: Social video + programmatic display for engagement  
- **Search Support ($400K)**: Brand search + category terms for intent capture

This channel mix maximizes your 50M reach while supporting the "nutrition + taste" message through video storytelling. TV builds mass awareness, digital enables targeting refinement.

Which channels feel most critical for establishing FreshBite as the taste breakthrough in better-for-you snacks?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Excellent choice. Based on Knowledge Base, YouTube and Connected TV are ideal for video storytelling campaigns, typically delivering $25-45 CPM for targeted reach.

Your video-first approach perfectly supports "nutrition without sacrificing taste" messaging. YouTube enables precise targeting of health-conscious professionals during relevant content moments, while CTV provides premium brand-safe environment with household-level targeting.

Suggested allocation within your $5.6M video budget:
- **Connected TV ($3.5M)**: Premium reach, 15-30 second spots
- **YouTube ($2.1M)**: Targeted storytelling, skip-able and non-skip formats

This 60/40 split maximizes broad reach through CTV while leveraging YouTube's superior targeting for your core audience.

What creative formats are you planning - short-form taste demonstrations or longer storytelling pieces?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 11:
Perfect. Your 15-second taste demonstration approach is smart. Based on Knowledge Base, short-form video creative (15-30 seconds) typically delivers strong brand recall lift in awareness campaigns while maintaining cost efficiency.

Step 7 complete with video-first channel strategy: CTV ($3.5M) + YouTube ($2.1M) for 15-second taste demonstrations.

Now Step 8 Measurement. You mentioned brand lift studies for success measurement. For national awareness with your $8M investment, I recommend quarterly brand lift studies measuring ad recall, awareness lift, and consideration lift. This approach validates whether your "nutrition without taste compromise" message is breaking through.

Your 15-second creative format should drive strong ad recall metrics, typically seeing 10-25% lift in exposed versus control groups.

What's your timeline for measuring success - quarterly tracking or campaign-end evaluation?
