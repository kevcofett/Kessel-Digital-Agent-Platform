# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience Unified Media Plan

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
With your $3M budget and 25,000 enrollment target, that implies a $120 CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) across all segments. My estimate is this is aggressive for health insurance, where acquisition costs typically run $150-300+ due to high consideration and regulatory requirements.

Are you measuring success by total enrollments, or do you have different value targets per segment since Young Professionals likely have different LTV (Lifetime Value) than Pre-Medicare customers?

Turn 2:
Perfect. Your segment approach is smart - Pre-Medicare likely has 3-5x higher LTV than Young Professionals due to tenure and premium levels. My estimate for health insurance CAC ranges $150-400 depending on segment complexity and competition.

With different LTVs per segment, we should weight budget allocation by efficiency opportunity, not just volume. Young Professionals might need $80-120 CAC for speed, while Pre-Medicare could justify $200-300 given higher value.

Step 1 complete with Objective: 25K enrollments, KPI: Total enrollments, Target: $120 blended CAC. Now Step 2 Economics - do you have LTV estimates per segment, or should I model using insurance industry assumptions?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it, I'll model using insurance industry assumptions. My estimate for health insurance LTV by segment:

**Young Professionals**: $2,400 LTV (24 months average tenure x $100 monthly profit)
**Families**: $4,800 LTV (36 months tenure x $133 monthly profit - higher premiums, more stable)  
**Pre-Medicare**: $7,200 LTV (48 months tenure x $150 monthly profit - highest premiums, most stable)

This suggests optimal CAC targets: Young Professionals $120 (20:1 LTV:CAC), Families $240 (20:1), Pre-Medicare $360 (20:1). Your $120 blended target is achievable if you weight spend toward Young Professionals, but you'd miss higher-value opportunities.

Should we model budget allocation by LTV opportunity, or do you need equal volume per segment for business reasons?

Turn 4:
Perfect approach - balancing value optimization with pipeline building. Here's my recommended allocation:

**Pre-Medicare (45% - $1.35M)**: 3,750 enrollments at $360 CAC
**Families (25% - $750K)**: 3,125 enrollments at $240 CAC  
**Young Professionals (30% - $900K)**: 18,125 enrollments at $120 CAC

This gets you 25K total enrollments with weighted average CAC of $200 (vs your $120 target). The higher investment reflects realistic market costs - my estimate for health insurance CAC typically runs $180-350 depending on segment competition.

Step 2 complete. Your blended target is ambitious but the value-weighted approach is smart strategy.

Now Step 3 Audience - your demographic definitions are solid, but what behavioral triggers drive each segment to shop for health insurance?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Perfect content ecosystem mapping. Your platform insights align with my experience - Young Professionals on LinkedIn/streaming, Families on Facebook/local digital, Pre-Medicare on financial/health sites.

Now let's size these audiences. Based on Knowledge Base, young professionals ages 26-35 health-conscious gym members audience in urban metros NYC SF LA Chicago is approximately 6.0% of total population.

For your three segments across target geographies:

**Young Professionals**: Urban metros (NYC, SF, LA, Chicago) - ~1.2M target audience
**Families**: Suburban markets around top 50 metros - need to size this  
**Pre-Medicare**: National with FL/AZ/TX concentration - need to size this

Should we focus on top 10 DMAs for Families, or do you need broader suburban reach across all 50 metros?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 5:
Excellent behavioral insight - life events are the highest-converting triggers for insurance. Based on Knowledge Base, behavioral targeting typically increases conversion 40-60% but raises CPMs 20-30% due to limited inventory.

With your CAC targets ($120/$240/$360), the precision is worth it:
- Young Professionals: Job change/relocation targeting justifies higher CPMs through conversion lift
- Families: School enrollment/spouse job change signals high intent
- Pre-Medicare: Retirement planning content consumption indicates active shopping

The targeting paradox: tighter behavioral signals boost conversion but cost more. For health insurance's competitive landscape, my estimate is 25% CPM increase but 50%+ conversion improvement - net positive for your targets.

What contextual signals matter - do segments prefer different content environments or platforms for insurance research?

Turn 7:
Smart concentration strategy. Based on Knowledge Base, families with children under 18 ages 35-50 audience in top 10 DMAs suburban markets is approximately 6.0% of total population.

| DMA | Population | Target Audience | Target % |
|-----|-----------|----------------|----------|
| New York | 20.1M | 1.21M | 6.0% |
| Los Angeles | 13.3M | 798K | 6.0% |
| Chicago | 9.6M | 576K | 6.0% |
| Philadelphia | 7.2M | 432K | 6.0% |
| Dallas-Fort Worth | 7.8M | 468K | 6.0% |
| San Francisco | 7.2M | 432K | 6.0% |
| Boston | 5.0M | 300K | 6.0% |
| Washington DC | 6.3M | 378K | 6.0% |
| Atlanta | 6.0M | 360K | 6.0% |
| Houston | 7.1M | 426K | 6.0% |
| **TOTAL** | **89.6M** | **5.4M** | **6.0%** |

This gives you 5.4M targetable families across top 10 DMAs - plenty of scale for your 3,125 enrollment target.

For Pre-Medicare segment, should we focus on FL/AZ/TX metros specifically, or model national reach?

Turn 8:
Perfect focus on high-density retirement markets. Based on Knowledge Base, pre-Medicare ages 55-64 approaching retirement audience in FL/AZ/TX metros is approximately 6.0% of total population.

| DMA | Population | Target Audience | Target % |
|-----|-----------|----------------|----------|
| Miami-Fort Lauderdale | 4.4M | 264K | 6.0% |
| Tampa-St. Petersburg | 3.2M | 192K | 6.0% |
| Orlando-Daytona Beach | 3.2M | 192K | 6.0% |
| Phoenix | 5.0M | 300K | 6.0% |
| Dallas-Fort Worth | 7.8M | 468K | 6.0% |
| Houston | 7.1M | 426K | 6.0% |
| San Antonio | 2.5M | 150K | 6.0% |
| Austin | 2.3M | 138K | 6.0% |
| **TOTAL** | **35.5M** | **2.1M** | **6.0%** |

This gives you 2.1M targetable Pre-Medicare prospects across FL/AZ/TX - strong scale for your 3,750 enrollment target.

Step 4 complete with total addressable: Young Professionals 1.2M, Families 5.4M, Pre-Medicare 2.1M. Now Step 5 Budget - should we model the $1.35M/$750K/$900K allocation we discussed earlier?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Perfect. Step 5 complete with $1.35M Pre-Medicare, $750K Families, $900K Young Professionals allocation. Now Step 6 Value Proposition - each segment needs distinct messaging.

**Young Professionals**: "Tech-forward convenience meets comprehensive coverage" - emphasize mobile app, quick decisions, transparent pricing
**Families**: "Comprehensive protection for what matters most" - focus on pediatric networks, predictable costs, family coverage  
**Pre-Medicare**: "Stable transition to your next chapter" - highlight network continuity, Medicare bridge planning, established relationships

Based on Knowledge Base, segmented value props typically improve conversion 20-30% vs generic messaging.

Which segment's value proposition feels most critical to refine - where do you see the biggest messaging risk?

Turn 10:
Exactly - Pre-Medicare messaging requires sophisticated empathy. Based on Knowledge Base, healthcare buying cycles are event-driven, and this transition is their biggest healthcare event.

Refined Pre-Medicare messaging: "Navigate your healthcare transition with confidence" - emphasizes guidance through complexity rather than aging. Focus on expertise helping them make informed decisions about bridge coverage before Medicare kicks in.

The anxiety isn't about getting older - it's about making the wrong choice during a once-in-a-lifetime transition. Position TrueHealth as the knowledgeable guide who understands this specific moment.

Step 6 complete. Now Step 7 Channels - given your content ecosystem insights, should we model Young Professionals heavy on LinkedIn/streaming, Families on Facebook/local digital, and Pre-Medicare on financial news sites?
