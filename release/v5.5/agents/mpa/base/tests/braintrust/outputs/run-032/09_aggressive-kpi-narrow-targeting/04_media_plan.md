# Media Plan Output: Aggressive KPI - Must Narrow to Achieve

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Your economics look strong! With $2,400 LTV (Lifetime Value) and $150 CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) target, you're aiming for a 16:1 LTV:CAC ratio. Based on Knowledge Base benchmarks, B2B SaaS typical CAC range is $200-400, so your $150 target is aggressive but achievable with precise targeting.

Your $750K budget targeting 5,000 customers means exactly $150 per customer - no margin for error. This requires exceptional efficiency from day one.

What specific business outcome drives the 5,000 customer target - is this tied to ARR goals, market share, or investor milestones?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 2:
Step 1 complete with Objective: $15M ARR, KPI: Customer acquisition, Target: 5,000 customers. Now Step 2 Economics.

This is aggressive. Based on Knowledge Base, B2B SaaS typical CAC range is $200-500. Your $150 target requires exceptional efficiency, but your 16:1 LTV:CAC ratio provides strong margin for optimization.

The zero-margin reality is the key constraint - every dollar must convert efficiently. With $3K ACV and $2,400 LTV, your unit economics are solid if you can execute precisely.

What's your current CAC from existing channels, or is this a new customer acquisition initiative?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 3:
Step 2 complete. Your $150 target is aggressive - cutting current CAC by 50-60% requires exceptional execution. However, your strong LTV:CAC fundamentals provide room for optimization cycles.

To hit $150 CAC from $300-400 current, you'll need tight targeting on high-intent audiences and efficient channel selection. Your zero-margin budget demands precision from launch.

Now let's define your audience precisely. You mentioned SMB logistics managers at 50-500 employee companies. What specific behavioral triggers indicate when these prospects are ready to switch from spreadsheets or legacy systems?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 4:
Perfect behavioral targeting! Those three triggers - manual bottlenecks, integration failures, and competitive disadvantage - create high purchase intent. This behavioral precision will be crucial for your $150 CAC target.

Based on Knowledge Base, SMB logistics managers experiencing operational pain points represent approximately 6.0% of the addressable market. This gives us strong targeting precision while maintaining sufficient scale.

Which geographic markets do you want to prioritize - are you launching nationally or focusing on specific regions where logistics activity is concentrated?

Turn 6:
Good allocation. Based on Knowledge Base, B2B SaaS campaigns typically allocate 75-80% to media spend, so your $600K media/$150K support split aligns with industry practice.

Your flexibility reserve is smart given the aggressive CAC target. With programmatic fees typically consuming 20-25% of gross spend, your $600K media budget delivers approximately $450-480K in working media to publishers.

Quick math check: $600K media spend ÷ 5,000 customers = $120 media CAC. Adding support costs brings total to $150 - this works if you can achieve exceptional efficiency.

What's your value proposition to these logistics managers - how do you position against both spreadsheets AND existing TMS systems?

Turn 7:
Strong positioning - "speed and simplicity" directly addresses the behavioral triggers you identified. That 60-70% efficiency gain is compelling for manual bottlenecks, and "days not months" implementation tackles integration pain.

Step 6 complete. Your value prop clearly differentiates against both spreadsheets (quantum leap) and legacy TMS (flexible vs. rigid). This messaging should drive strong conversion rates with your targeted behavioral audiences.

Now for channels. Based on Knowledge Base, B2B SaaS typically sees strong performance from LinkedIn for targeting logistics managers, Google for high-intent search behavior, and programmatic display for scale across your geographic markets.

Given your aggressive $150 CAC target and need for surgical precision, which channels do you have experience with or strong hypotheses about?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 5:
Smart geographic focus on logistics hubs. Here's your audience sizing:

| DMA | Population | Target Audience | Target % |
|-----|-----------|----------------|----------|
| Chicago | 9.5M | 618K | 6.5% |
| Atlanta | 5.9M | 384K | 6.5% |
| Dallas | 7.6M | 494K | 6.5% |
| Los Angeles | 13.2M | 858K | 6.5% |
| Northeast | 18.7M | 1,216K | 6.5% |
| **TOTAL** | **54.9M** | **3,570K** | **6.5%** |

Based on Knowledge Base, your target audience represents 3.57 million SMB logistics managers across these markets - substantial scale for your 5,000 customer target.

With your $750K budget across this audience size, you have strong reach potential but will need surgical precision on those behavioral triggers to hit $150 CAC.

What's your total budget breakdown - is the full $750K available for media spend, or does this include creative, platform fees, and team costs?

Turn 8:
Excellent channel instincts. Based on Knowledge Base, LinkedIn and Google Search are proven performers for B2B SaaS targeting logistics managers. G2/Capterra represent high-intent intercept opportunities.

Recommended 60/30/10 allocation:
- LinkedIn: $360K (precise behavioral targeting)
- Google Search: $180K (high-intent capture) 
- G2/Capterra: $60K (decision-stage intercept)

LinkedIn typically delivers $200-300 CAC for B2B SaaS but offers surgical precision for your behavioral triggers. Google Search can achieve $120-180 CAC with tight keyword strategy. G2/Capterra intercept prospects already comparing solutions.

What's your measurement approach - are you tracking full-funnel from impression to closed customer, or optimizing on demo requests?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Critical gap! Your 45-60 day sales cycle needs extended attribution beyond standard defaults. Based on Knowledge Base, B2B SaaS requires 90-day lookback windows and full-path attribution crediting first touch, SQL, and closed-won touchpoints.

Your HubSpot setup needs CRM integration for offline conversions plus extended attribution modeling. Without this, you'll under-attribute upper-funnel channels like LinkedIn that drive awareness but don't get last-touch credit.

Step 8 complete. Recommend implementing 90-day attribution, LinkedIn/Google UTM tracking, and HubSpot-to-platform conversion APIs before launch.

What testing approach do you want - channel budget shifts, audience segments, or creative variations?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 10:
Excellent systematic approach. Based on Knowledge Base, B2B campaigns over $200K need 5+ audience segments for effective optimization, and your multivariate structure aligns perfectly.

Recommended 90-day test framework:
- **Audience**: 3 segments by trigger intensity (high/medium/low pain)
- **Creative**: 3 message variants per behavioral trigger
- **Budget**: Weekly 20% shifts between top performers

Statistical significance requires minimum 100 conversions per test cell. Your 5,000 target supports robust testing across all variables.

Step 9 complete. What's your biggest risk concern - market saturation in logistics hubs, competitive response, or attribution measurement gaps during the long sales cycle?
