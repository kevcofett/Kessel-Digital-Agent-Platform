# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience with Segment-Specific Channels

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Your $100 CAC target is ambitious but achievable. My estimate based on online education benchmarks suggests typical CAC ranges from $75-200 depending on program value and competition.

Before we dive into segment-specific channel strategies, what's your primary KPI beyond enrollments - is it total enrollments, qualified leads, or revenue, and what's the target timeframe for these 50,000 enrollments?

Turn 2:
Step 1 complete with Objective: 50,000 enrollments, KPI: total enrollments, Target: 12 months. Now Step 2 Economics.

Your $100 CAC target is aggressive. My estimate for online education suggests typical CAC ranges $75-200 depending on program value and lifetime value. With your $5M budget targeting 50,000 enrollments, that's exactly $100 per enrollment - zero margin for error.

What's your average student lifetime value, and do you have data on repeat enrollments or upsells to additional courses?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it - I'll model using assumptions. Based on your $500-2,500 course range, I'll estimate average student value at $1,200 with 1.3x repeat enrollment rate, suggesting LTV around $1,560. Your $100 CAC target creates a healthy 15.6:1 LTV:CAC ratio - that's sustainable.

Step 2 complete. Your $100 target is aggressive but achievable with tight targeting and strong creative.

Now let's size your audiences. Starting with Career Changers in tech hubs - what percentage of mid-career professionals in those six metros would realistically consider online upskilling in a 12-month period?

Turn 5:
Your 15-18% estimate is optimistic. Based on Knowledge Base, college-age students exploring alternative education represents approximately 6.0% of the national 18-24 population - roughly 1.8 million potential students. This creates massive scale but lower conversion rates on social platforms.

For Corporate L&D decision-makers - what percentage of mid-to-large companies actively evaluate new training programs annually?

Turn 7:
Perfect. Your top 30-35 metros with college populations and tech ecosystems create focused reach while maintaining scale.

Step 4 complete. Total addressable audience: 3.2M across three distinct segments with minimal overlap.

Now Step 5 Budget. Based on Knowledge Base, multi-segment campaigns require independent budget allocation per audience. With your $5M total budget and three very different segments, how would you initially allocate across Career Changers, College-Age, and Corporate L&D?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 4:
Your 8-10% estimate aligns well with market data. Based on Knowledge Base, mid-career professionals in tech hubs across your six metros represents approximately 6.0% of total metro population - about 1.2 million professionals actively considering upskilling.

Your targeting is precise but creates a competitive environment - expect higher CPMs in these markets, especially on LinkedIn where this audience clusters.

For College-Age segment nationally - what percentage of 18-24 year-olds would realistically consider online alternatives to traditional college in the next 12 months?

Turn 6:
Your 25-30% estimate is aggressive. Based on Knowledge Base, Corporate L&D decision makers at mid to large companies in US national is approximately 6.0%, representing roughly 185,000 active evaluators annually. This is your smallest but highest-value segment - longer sales cycles but higher deal sizes.

Now let's map this geographically. Here's your audience sizing across segments:

| Segment | Geography | Target Audience | Strategy |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Career Changers | 6 Tech Metros | 1.2M | LinkedIn/Podcasts |
| College-Age | National | 1.8M | TikTok/Instagram |
| Corporate L&D | National | 185K | ABM/LinkedIn |
| **TOTAL** | **Mixed** | **3.2M** | **Multi-Channel** |

Which specific markets should we prioritize for your College-Age segment beyond "national" - top 20 metros, college towns, or broader reach?

Turn 8:
Your allocation is strategically sound. Based on Knowledge Base, multi-segment campaigns require independent budget allocation, and your split reflects both audience size and channel cost realities.

Let me calculate what this means per segment:
- Career Changers: $2M ÷ ~20,000 enrollments = $100 CAC (achievable)
- College-Age: $1.75M ÷ ~25,000 enrollments = $70 CAC (aggressive but realistic)  
- Corporate L&D: $1.25M ÷ ~5,000 enrollments = $250 CAC (premium but justified for B2B)

Step 5 complete. Your budget allocation balances efficiency targets with channel realities.

What's your core value proposition that differentiates EduPath from traditional education and other online competitors?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 9:
Your skills-first, career-aligned positioning is strong. Based on Knowledge Base, multi-segment campaigns require distinct value proposition messaging per audience since each has different motivations and decision frameworks.

Step 6 complete. Your differentiation - industry-validated skills for immediate career mobility - resonates across all three segments.

Now Step 7 Channels. Your segment-specific approach is spot-on. For Career Changers with $2M budget, LinkedIn and podcasts make sense, but LinkedIn CPMs in tech metros run $15-25. For College-Age with $1.75M, TikTok offers scale at $8-12 CPMs. Corporate L&D needs ABM approach - likely LinkedIn + programmatic display.

Which channels within each segment should we prioritize first for testing and optimization?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 10:
Your channel priorities are strategically sound. My estimate suggests LinkedIn CPMs in tech metros run $18-25 for professional targeting, podcast sponsorships range $15-30 CPM, TikTok creator partnerships cost $8-15 CPM, and programmatic display in trade publications runs $5-10 CPM.

Step 7 complete. Your channel mix balances precision targeting with cost efficiency per segment.

Now Step 8 Measurement. With three distinct segments and different attribution windows (immediate for social, longer for B2B), what's your primary success metric beyond enrollments - cost per lead, cost per qualified prospect, or straight cost per enrollment?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Perfect segmented approach. Based on Knowledge Base, B2B attribution typically requires 60-90 day windows versus 7-30 days for B2C, and your measurement framework should match purchase cycle complexity.

Recommended attribution:
- Career Changers/College-Age: 14-day click attribution, cost per enrollment
- Corporate L&D: 90-day click attribution, cost per qualified lead + pipeline velocity

Step 8 complete. Your segment-specific measurement recognizes different purchase journeys.

Now Step 9 Testing. With three distinct segments and channels, what's your priority for initial testing - creative formats, audience precision, or channel performance validation?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 8: Measurement

Turn 12:
Your audience-precision-first approach is smart. Based on Knowledge Base, multi-segment campaigns require independent optimization per audience before creative testing to avoid wasted spend on wrong targets.

Recommended testing sequence:
Week 1-2: Audience precision (LinkedIn job titles, TikTok creator archetypes, L&D company sizes)
Week 3-4: Creative format testing within validated audiences
Week 5-8: Optimization and scaling winners

Step 9 complete. Your testing prioritization minimizes waste while maximizing learning.

Final step - what's your biggest concern about executing this three-segment strategy over the next 12 months?
