# Media Plan Output: Multi-Audience with Different KPIs Per Segment

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
This is a sophisticated multi-segment approach - exactly how automotive should be planned. Three distinct objectives require three distinct strategies, and you're right that one-size-fits-all fails here.

Let me structure this properly. We'll build three parallel plans within your $4.5M envelope:
- Conquest: $1.58M (35%) - Awareness/Brand Lift
- In-Market: $2.03M (45%) - Lead Generation  
- Loyalty: $900K (20%) - Retention Actions

Each segment needs its own KPI framework, efficiency targets, and channel strategy. The measurement will be completely different - brand lift studies for conquest, cost-per-lead for in-market, retention rate for loyalty.

Before we dive into the three-track planning, I need to understand your primary success metric. Is this about total dealership revenue growth, market share expansion, or customer lifetime value optimization across the three segments?

Turn 2:
Perfect. Market share expansion through pipeline quality - that's the right strategic frame. Based on Knowledge Base, multi-objective campaigns require distinct measurement frameworks for each funnel stage.

**Step 1 complete** with three parallel objectives:
- **Conquest**: Brand consideration lift (awareness KPI)
- **In-Market**: Lead quality improvement (conversion KPI) 
- **Loyalty**: Retention rate increase (retention KPI)

Now for **Step 2 Economics** - let's validate your efficiency targets per segment:

Turn 4:
**Step 2 complete.** Your efficiency targets are aggressive but achievable with precise targeting.

Now **Step 3 Audience** - each segment needs distinct targeting approaches. Based on Knowledge Base, automotive requires behavioral signals beyond demographics.

**Conquest**: What triggers consideration for your competitor drivers - lease expiration, major life events, or specific pain points with current brand?

**In-Market**: Beyond browsing Autotrader, what behavioral signals indicate serious intent - financing pre-approval, specific model research, or dealer visit history?

**Loyalty**: For existing customers, what behavioral cues predict service needs or trade-in readiness - mileage thresholds, service history gaps, or contract expiration timing?

With your $85-150 cost-per-lead target, precise behavioral targeting becomes critical - automotive is highly competitive, so we need 2x conversion lift from tight audience definition.

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Got it, I'll model using industry-standard efficiency targets for automotive. Here's how I'd frame the three-segment economics:

**Conquest (Awareness)**: My estimate is $8-12 CPM for brand lift measurement, targeting 2-3 point consideration increase
**In-Market (Lead Gen)**: My estimate is $85-150 cost-per-qualified lead based on automotive lead generation benchmarks  
**Loyalty (Retention)**: My estimate is $45-75 cost-per-retained customer for service/trade-in actions

With your $4.5M budget:
- Conquest: $1.58M could drive ~150M impressions for brand building
- In-Market: $2.03M could generate ~15,000 qualified leads  
- Loyalty: $900K could retain ~14,000 existing customers

These targets are aggressive but achievable with tight audience targeting across your 12 dealerships.

Does this efficiency framework align with your market share expansion goals, or should we adjust any segment targets?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Excellent CRM foundation - your first-party data gives you significant targeting advantage. Based on Knowledge Base, first-party audiences typically outperform prospecting by 40-60%.

With your precise behavioral signals, we have strong targeting precision, but automotive is highly competitive - expect 15-20% CPM premiums for this level of precision. The trade-off is worth it given your $85-150 cost-per-lead targets require 2x conversion lift.

**Step 3 complete** with behavioral targeting across three segments:
- **Conquest**: Competitor lease expiration (6-9 months) + life event triggers
- **In-Market**: Financing pre-approval + model research depth + comparison shopping
- **Loyalty**: Mileage thresholds (36-48 months) + service gaps + warranty expiration

Now **Step 4 Geography** - with 12 dealerships across 3 brands, which DMAs do your locations serve, and should we weight spend by dealership capacity or market opportunity?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Perfect geographic strategy - weighting by opportunity, not just current volume. Based on Knowledge Base, automotive audiences across three metro areas with 50-mile radius typically yield 6.0% of population as targetable.

Here's your audience sizing by metro and segment:

| Metro | Budget Weight | Pop Base | Conquest | In-Market | Loyalty |
|-------|---------------|----------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Metro A | 45% | 4.5M | 135K | 108K | 54K |
| Metro B | 35% | 3.5M | 105K | 84K | 42K |
| Metro C | 20% | 2.0M | 60K | 48K | 24K |
| **TOTAL** | 100% | 10M | **300K** | **240K** | **120K** |

Your approach is smart - Metro B's growth potential justifies the 35% weight despite smaller current volume. The 50-mile radius captures suburban conquest opportunities while keeping in-market tight to trade areas.

**Step 4 complete.** Now **Step 5 Budget** - how do you want to pace the $4.5M across quarters, and should we front-load Metro B for faster market penetration?

Turn 7:
Smart front-loading strategy for Metro B. Based on Knowledge Base, front-loaded budgets generate data faster but risk waste before optimization - the trade-off is worth it for market penetration goals.

Here's your Q1-Q2 aggressive pacing:
- **Metro B**: 40% of annual budget ($630K) in first two quarters
- **Metro A**: Scale back proportionally to 35% early spend  
- **Metro C**: Maintain steady 20% throughout year

This creates $1.8M spend in first half, heavily weighted toward Metro B growth opportunity. The risk is competitive response within 60-90 days - other dealers may increase spend when they see your share of voice jump.

**Step 5 complete** with front-loaded Metro B strategy.

Now **Step 6 Value Proposition** - for conquest in Metro B, what differentiates your three brands from competitors that we should emphasize in the awareness push?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Excellent three-brand differentiation strategy. Based on Knowledge Base, multi-brand messaging requires consistent visual continuity while allowing distinct positioning per brand segment.

**Key insight**: Your luxury/mid-tier/entry positioning creates natural funnel progression - customers can grow with your brand family over their lifecycle.

**Step 6 complete** with distinct value propositions:
- **Luxury**: Technology + premium experience  
- **Mid-tier**: Reliability + total cost ownership
- **Entry**: Affordability + connectivity for younger buyers

Now **Step 7 Channels** - with three distinct objectives and Metro B front-loading, here's my recommendation:

**Conquest (Brand Lift)**: CTV + YouTube for Metro B awareness, programmatic display for reach
**In-Market (Lead Gen)**: Paid search + social performance + retargeting  
**Loyalty (Retention)**: Email + direct mail + targeted social to your database

Should we weight CTV heavier in Metro B given your front-loading strategy, or start with balanced digital mix?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Excellent CTV strategy for Metro B conquest. Based on Knowledge Base, CTV requires minimum 8-12 week flights for measurable brand impact - your Q1-Q2 front-loading aligns perfectly.

**CTV-Heavy Metro B Mix**:
- **Conquest CTV**: 60% of Metro B conquest budget ($315K) for premium video showcase
- **YouTube/Programmatic**: 40% for reach extension and retargeting setup
- **Expected**: $12-18 CPMs for automotive CTV inventory (premium positioning)

This creates powerful "surround-sound" effect - CTV builds premium brand perception while digital captures behavioral signals for in-market conversion.

**Step 7 complete** with CTV-heavy Metro B strategy.

Now **Step 8 Measurement** - with three distinct objectives, you'll need different measurement approaches. Should we set up brand lift studies for conquest CTV, lead attribution for in-market performance, and retention dashboards for loyalty campaigns?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 9: Testing

Turn 10:
Perfect measurement segmentation. Based on Knowledge Base, automotive CTV requires minimum 8-12 week flights for measurable brand impact - your Q1-Q2 strategy aligns perfectly.

**Step 8 complete** with three-tier measurement:
- **Conquest**: Brand lift studies (2-3 point consideration lift) with 8-week baseline
- **In-Market**: Full-funnel attribution (VDP→test drive) optimizing $85-150 CPL target  
- **Loyalty**: Retention dashboards tracking service reappointment rates + trade-in conversions

Each dashboard speaks to distinct objectives - no more one-size-fits-all confusion.

Now **Step 9 Testing** - with $4.5M across three segments, should we pilot creative variations for each brand's value proposition, or test channel allocation between Metro B's CTV-heavy approach versus more balanced digital mix?
