# Media Plan Output: Volume Target Increase

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Your $80 CAC target is realistic - my estimate for home goods e-commerce typically ranges $60-120. What specific business outcome are you prioritizing: revenue growth, market share expansion, or customer base building?

Turn 2:
Perfect - customer base building with your $320 LTV (Lifetime Value) gives strong unit economics for acquisition investment. Your $80 CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) target is achievable - my estimate for home goods e-commerce typically ranges $60-120.

Step 1 complete with Objective: customer base building, KPI: new customer acquisition, Target: 5,000 customers. Now Step 2 Economics.

With your $400K budget targeting 5,000 customers, you have solid margin for optimization. Your 4:1 LTV:CAC ratio is healthy for sustainable growth. What's your typical customer payback period - how long until that $320 LTV is realized?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Your 10-12 month payback aligns well with customer base building strategy. Based on Knowledge Base, ecommerce LTV:CAC ratios vary by segment, and your 4:1 ratio provides strong foundation for patient acquisition.

Step 2 complete. Your $80 CAC target is achievable given typical home goods ranges.

Now let's define your homeowner audience. You mentioned 30-55 age range - what behavioral triggers make someone likely to purchase home goods? Are you targeting new homeowners, renovators, or general home improvement enthusiasts?

Turn 4:
Excellent - visually motivated homeowners refreshing spaces gives us strong behavioral targeting. Pinterest and Instagram usage signals purchase intent for home décor.

Based on Knowledge Base, homeowners refreshing living spaces with disposable income represents approximately 6.0% of the US population - roughly 19.8M adults. With your $80 CAC and visual platform preference, this audience size supports sustainable scale.

What geographic scope are you considering - national reach or focusing on specific regions where HomeStyle Direct has stronger brand presence or logistics advantages?

Turn 5:
Perfect - national reach maximizes your market opportunity. Based on Knowledge Base, homeowners refreshing living spaces with disposable income audience in US national is approximately 6.0%, representing roughly 19.8M adults nationwide.

| Market Scope | Population | Target Audience | Target % |
|--------------|------------|-----------------|----------|
| US National  | 330M adults| 19.8M          | 6.0%     |

With 5,000 customer target from 19.8M addressable audience, you need just 0.025% conversion - very achievable with your $80 CAC budget.

Step 4 complete with national targeting of visually motivated homeowners.

How will you allocate your $400K budget across the year - equal monthly spend, or seasonal weighting toward home improvement periods like spring?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 6:
Smart seasonal weighting - 40% toward March-June captures peak home improvement motivation. Based on Knowledge Base, spring periods typically see increased competition and CPMs, but home improvement categories benefit from higher intent.

Your April-May peak timing is optimal for homeowner engagement when tax refunds and weather drive project planning.

Step 5 complete. Your $400K budget with seasonal weighting toward peak intent periods maximizes efficiency.

What's your core value proposition to these homeowners - are you positioning as affordable style, premium quality, or unique/hard-to-find pieces that differentiate from big box retailers?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 7:
Excellent positioning - "curated, affordable style" differentiates perfectly between big box commodity and premium unattainable. This messaging resonates strongly with your visually motivated homeowners seeking design value.

Your "smart alternative" positioning gives clear competitive advantage and justifies slightly higher price points than mass retailers while staying accessible.

Step 6 complete. Your value proposition aligns with audience motivation and budget capacity.

Based on Knowledge Base, home goods campaigns with visual positioning typically perform best on Pinterest and Instagram for inspiration-driven discovery, plus Google for intent capture. Given your $400K budget and 5,000 customer target, which channels feel most aligned with where your audience discovers home décor inspiration?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
With the budget cut to $400K for 8,000 customers, that drops your CAC to $50 - this is aggressive. My estimate for home goods e-commerce typically ranges $60-120, so you'd need exceptional efficiency.

To hit $50 CAC, you'd need tighter targeting (higher CPMs but better conversion), stronger creative performance, or landing page optimization. Your 6.4:1 LTV:CAC ratio is still healthy, but margin for error shrinks significantly.

Which feels more realistic - pushing efficiency to hit 8,000 customers, or requesting budget increase to $640K for sustainable $80 CAC?

Turn 9:
Exactly right - 6,000 customers at $67 CAC is much more defendable than stretching to 8,000 at $50. Your team's instinct to prioritize performance over arbitrary targets is smart.

My estimate for home goods e-commerce CAC typically ranges $60-120, so $67 sits comfortably within proven ranges. At $50, you'd need everything to go perfectly with no optimization time.

Going back with "we can efficiently deliver 6,000 customers or need $500-600K for 8,000" shows strategic thinking. Which option do you want to model first - the efficient 6,000 customer scenario or the expanded budget case?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 10:
Perfect approach. Let's model 6,000 customers at $67 CAC first - this puts you in the efficient zone within typical home goods ranges.

Based on your visual audience and seasonal weighting, I'd recommend Pinterest for discovery, Instagram for inspiration, and Google for intent capture. Your "curated, affordable style" positioning works perfectly across this funnel.

With March-June seasonal weighting and visual platform focus, what's your current sense of creative capacity - can your team produce fresh Pinterest pins and Instagram content consistently, or would you need creative support?
