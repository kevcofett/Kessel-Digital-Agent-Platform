# Media Plan Output: Timeline Compression

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
Your $48 CAC target is realistic. Based on Knowledge Base, typical retail CAC is $20-80, so you're well within achievable range.

Beyond customer acquisition, what specific business outcome are you trying to drive - is it revenue growth, market share expansion, or something else?

Turn 2:
Perfect - revenue growth through market share expansion with 25K new customers at $48 CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost). Your focus on social channels aligns well with that demographic.

Step 1 complete with Objective: Revenue growth, KPI: Customer acquisition, Target: 25K customers. Now Step 2 Economics.

With your $1.2M budget and 25K target, that's $48 per customer. Based on Knowledge Base, retail typical CAC is $20-80, so your target is achievable. With $180 LTV (Lifetime Value), your LTV:CAC ratio is 3.75:1 - solid foundation for profitable growth.

What's your typical customer purchase frequency over that $180 lifetime value?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Excellent - your economics are strong. With 2-3 purchases annually at $85 AOV (Average Order Value), you're building genuine customer relationships, not one-and-done transactions. Based on Knowledge Base, repeat customers within 6 months indicate healthy retention patterns.

Step 2 complete. Your $48 CAC target is achievable with solid 3.75:1 LTV:CAC ratio.

Now let's define your audience precisely. You mentioned 25-45 year old urban fashion women, but high-performing campaigns need deeper targeting. What triggers these women to buy - is it seasonal trends, special occasions, lifestyle changes, or something else?

Turn 4:
Excellent behavioral targeting - lifestyle transitions and seasonal triggers are powerful purchase motivators. Based on Knowledge Base, behavioral signals like "work-to-evening wardrobe" and "seasonal refreshers" significantly improve targeting precision.

With your $48 CAC, this behavioral precision helps conversion, but fashion targeting is competitive - expect 15-20% higher CPMs on Instagram and TikTok. The conversion lift from precise targeting typically offsets the cost increase.

What geographic markets are you prioritizing - top metro areas, specific regions, or national reach?

Turn 5:
Smart geographic strategy - starting with tier 1 metros builds strong foundation before expansion. Based on Knowledge Base, urban professional women 25-45 fashion-forward audience in top 10 DMAs represents approximately 6.0% of population.

| DMA | Population | Target Audience | Target % |
| New York | 20.1M | 1.21M | 6.0% |
| Los Angeles | 13.2M | 792K | 6.0% |  
| Chicago | 9.6M | 576K | 6.0% |
| San Francisco | 4.7M | 282K | 6.0% |
| **TOTAL TOP 4** | **47.6M** | **2.86M** | **6.0%** |

Your 25K customer target represents less than 1% of this audience - plenty of headroom for efficient acquisition without saturation.

What's your total budget allocation between these tier 1 markets versus tier 2 expansion markets?

Turn 6:
Strong budget allocation strategy. Based on Knowledge Base, tier 1 metro concentration typically delivers 15-20% higher efficiency before scaling to tier 2 markets.

Your $840K in tier 1 metros targets 2.86M audience pool - that's $294 cost per thousand people, allowing selective high-value targeting without market saturation.

Step 4 complete. Now Step 5 Budget.

With $840K tier 1 and $360K tier 2 allocation, what's your value proposition that differentiates Urban Essentials from other fashion brands targeting these same professional women?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 7:
Timeline compression significantly changes your efficiency requirements. With 6 months instead of 12, you need 25K customers in half the time - that's aggressive but achievable with the right approach.

Based on Knowledge Base, compressed timelines typically require 20-30% higher spend efficiency due to limited optimization time and seasonal CPM variations. Your Q1-Q2 timing is actually favorable - January-May CPMs run 20-30% lower than Q4.

With $1.2M over 6 months targeting 25K customers, you'll need tight execution from day one. What's your value proposition that differentiates Urban Essentials - this becomes critical for immediate conversion without lengthy brand building?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 8:
Perfect value prop - "workwear that transitions" solves a real pain point for busy professionals. The versatility message reduces purchase friction compared to single-occasion fashion.

Step 6 complete. Your mix-and-match positioning creates immediate value clarity.

Now Step 7 Channels. With 6 months and $1.2M, you need channels that can scale quickly. Based on Knowledge Base, Instagram and TikTok are strong for fashion retail, but require $2K-5K monthly minimums for optimization.

Your compressed timeline demands efficiency from day one - which channel should be your primary driver, Instagram or TikTok?

Turn 9:
Excellent choice - Instagram is the right primary channel for professional women 25-45. Based on Knowledge Base, 60-65% allocation to Instagram allows proper optimization while maintaining channel diversification.

With compressed timeline, you need channels that scale immediately. Instagram's targeting precision for "workwear transition" messaging should drive strong early performance.

What's your secondary channel for the remaining 35-40% budget - search to capture purchase intent, or another social platform for broader reach?

Turn 10:
Perfect channel combination - Instagram for lifestyle storytelling plus Google Search for high-intent capture. Based on Knowledge Base, this Instagram-heavy/Search secondary mix is optimal for fashion retail with compressed timelines.

With 60-65% Instagram and Search as secondary, you're capturing both inspiration and intent. Long-tail keywords like "professional mix-and-match clothing" align perfectly with your value prop.

Step 7 complete. Now Step 8 Measurement.

With 6-month compressed timeline, what KPI will you track weekly to ensure you're on pace for 25K customers - total acquisitions, channel-specific CAC, or something else?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 11:
Strong weekly KPI focus - total acquisitions and blended CAC at $48 with $60 alarm threshold gives you tight control. Based on Knowledge Base, compressed 6-month timelines require immediate optimization since learning phases consume first 1-2 weeks of each channel.

Step 8 complete. Now Step 9 Testing.

With your aggressive timeline, what's your testing approach - will you A/B test creative concepts on Instagram, or run parallel campaigns to validate your Instagram-heavy allocation against other channel mixes?
