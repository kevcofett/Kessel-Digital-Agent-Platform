# Media Plan Output: Behavioral Targeting Change

This document contains the key outputs from the media planning conversation.

## Step 1: Outcomes

Turn 1:
My estimate for subscription nutrition CAC typically ranges $25-45. Your $16 target is aggressive but achievable with tight targeting and strong conversion optimization.

What specific business outcome are you prioritizing - total subscriber volume, profitable growth, or market share expansion?

Turn 2:
Perfect. Step 1 complete with Objective: profitable growth, KPI: CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost), Target: $16. Now Step 2 Economics.

Your $420 LTV against $16 CAC target gives you a 26:1 ratio. My estimate for healthy subscription businesses is 15:1 minimum, with 20:1+ being excellent. You have strong margin for error.

What's your typical subscriber retention curve - how long do customers stay active on average?

## Step 3: Audience

Turn 3:
Step 2 complete. Your $16 CAC target is aggressive. Based on Knowledge Base, your 26:1 LTV:CAC ratio is excellent - healthy subscription businesses target 3:1 to 5:1 ratios. Your 25-30% quarterly churn aligns with typical subscription patterns.

Now Step 3 Audience. You mentioned fitness enthusiasts 25-55 - let's get more precise. What triggers someone to start using endurance nutrition products?

Turn 4:
Great trigger insight - event training creates urgency and commitment. Based on Knowledge Base, endurance athletes training for marathons, triathlons, and cycling events represent approximately 6.0% of the US adult population.

With your $16 CAC target, this precision helps but creates inventory constraints on platforms. What's their typical training timeline - how far out do they start planning nutrition?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 4: Geography

Turn 5:
Perfect behavioral insight - 12-16 week planning window creates sustained search behavior. Based on Knowledge Base, endurance athletes training for marathons, triathlons, and cycling events represent approximately 6.0% of the US adult population, giving you roughly 15.6M potential targets nationally.

Which geographic markets matter most - are there regions with higher concentrations of endurance events or stronger fitness cultures?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 5: Budget

Turn 6:
Based on Knowledge Base, here's your audience sizing for key endurance markets:

| DMA | Population | Target Audience | Target % |
|-----|------------|----------------|----------|
| New York | 20.1M | 1.2M | 6.0% |
| Los Angeles | 13.2M | 792K | 6.0% |
| San Francisco | 4.7M | 282K | 6.0% |
| Chicago | 9.5M | 570K | 6.0% |
| Boston | 4.9M | 294K | 6.0% |
| Seattle | 4.0M | 240K | 6.0% |
| Denver | 2.9M | 174K | 6.0% |
| **TOTAL** | **59.3M** | **3.6M** | **6.0%** |

Step 4 complete. Your core markets give you 3.6M targetable endurance athletes. With 50K subscriber target, you need 1.4% market penetration - realistic for subscription nutrition.

What's your total budget breakdown - is the full $800K for media, or does this include creative production and other costs?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 6: Value Proposition

Turn 7:
Much tighter targeting - smart for product fit. Based on Knowledge Base, marathon runners actively training represents roughly 1-2% of your original fitness enthusiast audience, so maybe 500K-1M nationally versus 15.6M.

With your $16 CAC, this precision helps conversion but expect 25-40% higher CPMs due to inventory constraints. Need 2x+ conversion lift to offset cost increase.

What's your total budget breakdown - is the full $800K for media spend?

Turn 8:
Step 5 complete. With $740-750K media budget and 50K subscriber target, that's $14.80-15.00 per acquisition - slightly under your $16 CAC target. Good cushion for efficiency.

Based on Knowledge Base, subscription businesses should optimize for customers likely to deliver long-term value, not maximum volume. What makes a marathon runner more likely to stay subscribed long-term versus churn quickly?

────────────────────────────────────────

## Step 7: Channels

Turn 9:
Excellent value prop insight - discipline and goal orientation are strong retention predictors. Based on Knowledge Base, optimizing for customers likely to deliver long-term value beats maximum volume. Marathon runners' structured approach suggests higher-quality subscribers.

Your messaging should emphasize performance optimization over convenience or price - this attracts committed athletes who value results over discounts.

What channels are you considering for reaching active marathon runners?

Turn 10:
Smart channel selection for marathon runners. Based on Knowledge Base, Google Search and social platforms where athletes are active typically deliver strong efficiency for subscription nutrition.

Your $14.80-15.00 per acquisition budget needs careful channel allocation. Instagram/Facebook likely $25-35 CPMs for marathon targeting, Google Search $3-6 CPCs for nutrition keywords.

How do you want to split the $740K across these channels?

Turn 11:
Strong channel allocation strategy. Based on Knowledge Base, your 40% Search / 35% Social split aligns with best practices for subscription nutrition - Search captures high-intent research, Social builds awareness.

Your $296K Search budget at estimated $4-5 CPCs should deliver 15-20K subscribers. Your $259K Social budget faces higher CPMs for marathon targeting but enables retargeting.

How will you measure incrementality across channels to avoid attribution overlap?

Turn 12:
Step 8 complete. Based on Knowledge Base, multi-touch attribution plus incrementality testing is the gold standard. Your marathon runner audience likely has 3-4 touchpoint journeys, so MTA reveals true channel interactions.

For $740K budget, plan geo holdout tests quarterly - 10% budget for control markets. This isolates true incrementality versus attribution overlap.

What testing priorities matter most - creative variations, audience segments, or channel efficiency?
