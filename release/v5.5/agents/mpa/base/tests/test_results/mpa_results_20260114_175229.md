## IDK-001: I Don't Know Protocol - User Uncertainty ❌
Duration: 67.2s | Turns: 10/10

### Turn 1
**User:** Media plan for a new coffee brand.
**Agent:** Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What business outcome are you trying to achieve with this coffee brand launch?
**Scores:** {'single_question': 1.0}

### Turn 2
**User:** Customer acquisition. Not sure how many we need.
**Agent:** Got it. I'll model using reasonable customer targets for a new coffee brand launch and you can refine anytime.

How will you measure success? Are you tracking customers acquired, revenue generated, or something else as your primary number?
**Scores:** {'single_question': 0.0, 'idk_protocol': 0.5}

### Turn 3
**User:** Budget is around $200K. I don't know what a realistic target is.
**Agent:** Perfect - $200K budget noted. Let me work backwards from that to show you what's realistic.

Based on Knowledge Base benchmarks for CPG brands, coffee customer acquisition typically costs $25-75 depending on channel mix and targeting precision. 

With $200K, that suggests 2,700-8,000 new customers i...
**Scores:** {'idk_protocol': 0.5, 'source_citation': 1.0}

### Turn 4
**User:** I don't know our customer LTV either.
**Agent:** Got it. I'll model using industry benchmarks for coffee brands - typically $75-150 customer lifetime value based on Knowledge Base data for subscription and repeat purchase patterns. You can adjust anytime.

With your $200K budget targeting ~4,000 customers (mid-range), you'd need roughly $50 custom...
**Scores:** {'idk_protocol': 0.5, 'progress_over_perfection': 0.5}

### Turn 5
**User:** I'm not sure who our target customer is exactly.
**Agent:** Got it. I'll model using typical premium coffee brand audiences based on Knowledge Base data. You can refine anytime.

Coffee brands typically target 25-45 year olds, household income $50K+, who buy premium products and value quality/sustainability. This gives us ~40 million people in the US to work...
**Scores:** {'idk_protocol': 0.5, 'progress_over_perfection': 0.5}

### Turn 6
**User:** No idea about geography either.
**Agent:** Got it. I'll model using a regional launch approach - typically 3-5 major metro areas for new coffee brands to test and optimize before scaling. You can refine anytime.

This actually helps your efficiency. Concentrating $200K across 15-20 million people in key markets like Seattle, Portland, Austin...
**Scores:** {'idk_protocol': 0.5, 'progress_over_perfection': 0.5}

### Turn 7
**User:** Continue with assumptions.
**Agent:** Got it. I'll model using premium positioning based on Knowledge Base data for successful coffee launches - focus on quality sourcing and sustainability which resonates with target audience. You can refine anytime.

With premium positioning, we can justify the $50 CAC target through higher-value cust...
**Scores:** {'idk_protocol': 0.5, 'progress_over_perfection': 0.5}

### Turn 8
**User:** What have you assumed so far?
**Agent:** Here are my assumptions so far:

**Customer Target:** ~4,000 new customers (mid-range of 2,700-8,000 possible with $200K)

**Economics:** $100 customer lifetime value, $50 customer acquisition cost, 2:1 LTV:CAC ratio

**Audience:** 25-45 years old, $50K+ household income, premium product buyers, qua...
**Scores:** {'self_referential_learning': 0.5, 'source_citation': 1.0}

### Turn 9
**User:** Actually I know our margin is 65%.
**Agent:** Perfect! That changes everything in a good way.

With 65% margin, your unit economics are much stronger than I modeled. If your average order value is reasonable - say $25-40 for premium coffee - you're looking at $16-26 gross profit per order.

For repeat customers, this could easily support the $1...
