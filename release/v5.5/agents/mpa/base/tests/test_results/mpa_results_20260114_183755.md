### Turn 1
**User:** Hi, I need help creating a media plan.
**Agent:** Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What business outcome are you trying to achieve?
**Scores:** {'response_length': 1.0, 'single_question': 1.0, 'tone': 0.5}

### Turn 2
**User:** We want to generate qualified leads for our B2B software product.
**Agent:** Perfect. Lead generation is clear.

How do you measure a qualified lead - what makes a lead "qualified" for your team?
**Scores:** {'single_question': 1.0, 'step_completion': 0.5}

### Turn 3
**User:** A qualified lead is someone who books a demo with our sales team.
**Agent:** Got it - demo bookings as your primary KPI. That's clean and measurable.

How many demo bookings do you want to generate?
**Scores:** {'single_question': 1.0, 'step_completion': 0.5}

### Turn 4
**User:** We want 500 demo bookings this quarter. Our budget is $150,000.
**Agent:** Step 1 complete with Objective: qualified leads, KPI: demo bookings, Target: 500. Now Step 2 Economics.

With your $150K budget and 500 demo targets, that's $300 per demo. Here's the thing - that's aggressive for B2B software. Based on Knowledge Base benchmarks, typical cost per demo runs $400-800 d...

### Turn 5
**User:** Is that a realistic target?
**Agent:** Based on your $300 cost per demo target, it's ambitious but not impossible. Knowledge Base data shows typical B2B software demo costs run $400-800, so you're targeting the aggressive end.

To hit $300 per demo, we'll need tight audience definition and efficient channel selection. Doable with the rig...

### Turn 6
**User:** What's the typical lifetime value for customers in this space?
**Agent:** Got it, I'll model using typical B2B software LTV. Based on Knowledge Base data for this category, typical LTV ranges $15K-50K depending on deal size and retention. You can adjust anytime.

What percentage of your demos typically convert to paying customers?
**Scores:** {'source_citation': 1.0, 'proactive_intelligence': 1.0}

### Turn 7
**User:** Our average contract is $50,000 annually with 80% gross margin.

What percentage of your demos typically convert to paying customers?
**Scores:** {'proactive_intelligence': 1.0, 'step_completion': 0.5}

### Turn 8
**User:** Who should we be targeting?
**Agent:** We'll get to audience targeting next, but first I need to complete the economics.

What percentage of your demos typically convert to paying customers?
**Scores:** {'step_boundary': 0.5, 'single_question': 1.0}

### Turn 9
**User:** IT directors and CIOs at mid-market companies, 500-5000 employees, in financial services and healthcare.
**Agent:** That's helpful for Step 3 Audience, but I need one more piece for economics first.

What percentage of your demos typically convert to paying customers?
**Scores:** {'proactive_intelligence': 1.0, 'source_citation': 1.0}

### Turn 10
**User:** Where should we focus geographically?
**Agent:** I'll model using typical B2B software demo conversion. Based on Knowledge Base benchmarks, typical demo-to-customer conversion is 15-25%. You can adjust anytime.

At 20% conversion, your 500 demos yield 100 customers worth $4M revenue ($3.2M gross profit). Your $150K spend against $3.2M profit shows...

### Turn 12
**User:** We already said our budget is $150K. What else do you need?
**Agent:** You're right - we have the $150K total budget covered.

Step 5 complete. Now Step 6 Value Proposition.

What's your core value proposition - how do you position your software to IT directors and CIOs?
**Scores:** {'self_referential_learning': 0.5, 'single_question': 1.0}

### Turn 13
**User:** The campaign runs Q2, April through June.
**Agent:** Got it - Q2 timing noted for implementation.

What's your core value proposition - how do you position your software to IT directors and CIOs in financial services and healthcare?
**Scores:** {'proactive_intelligence': 1.0, 'step_completion': 0.5}

### Turn 14
**User:** What makes our product unique is that we reduce compliance costs by 40% guaranteed.
**Agent:** Strong value prop - 40% guaranteed compliance cost reduction. That's compelling for your target audience, especially in heavily regulated sectors like finance and healthcare.

Step 6 complete. Now Step 7 Channels.

Given your narrow but high-value audience of IT executives, which channels are you co...
**Scores:** {'step_completion': 0.5}

### Turn 15
**User:** Now what channels should we use?
**Agent:** With your tight audience of 8K-12K IT executives and $300 cost per demo target, here's what works:

**LinkedIn ads** - Best for precise targeting of IT directors/CIOs by company size and industry. Expect $50-80 CPCs, 2-4% CTR to landing page.

**Account-based display** - Reaches your target accounts...
**Scores:** {'step_boundary': 0.5, 'proactive_intelligence': 1.0}

### Turn 16
**User:** Why LinkedIn over other options?
**Agent:** LinkedIn wins for three reasons with your specific targets:

**Precision targeting** - You can target exactly "IT Director/CIO at 500-5000 employee companies in Financial Services/Healthcare in NYC/SF/Chicago/Boston/LA." No other channel gets this granular.

**Decision-maker reach** - Your audience ...

### Turn 17
**User:** What about Google?

Search volume for "compliance software" or "reduce compliance costs" is limit...
**Scores:** {'source_citation': 0.0, 'proactive_intelligence': 1.0}

**User:** How should we split the budget across channels?
**Agent:** Based on your targets and audience, here's my recommended split:

Here's your measurement framework:

**Primary:** Demo bookings by channel (target: 500 total)
**Secondary:** Cost per demo by channel (target: $300 average)  
**Leading indicators:** Click-through rates, landing page...
**Scores:** {'step_boundary': 0.5, 'source_citation': 0.0}

### Turn 20
**User:** Should we use ROAS as our primary metric?
**Agent:** No - ROAS is misleading for your campaign. Here's why:

**Platform inflation** - LinkedIn and Google inflate revenue attribution, often claiming 300-500% ROAS when true incrementality is much lower.

**Attribution gaps** - Your IT executives research over weeks across multiple touchpoints. ROAS miss...

### Turn 22
**User:** What are the biggest risks?
**Agent:** Step 10 Risks. Here are your biggest threats:

**Audience too narrow** - 8K-12K universe means limited scale. If response rates disappoint, you can't easily expand volume without diluting quality.

### Turn 1
**User:** I need a media plan for our direct-to-consumer skincare brand.
**Agent:** Hi! I'm excited to build a media plan with you. We'll cover ten areas: Outcomes, Economics, Audience, Geography, Budget, Value Proposition, Channels, Measurement, Testing, and Risks. Each step builds on the last.

What business outcome are you trying to achieve with this campaign?

**User:** We have $500,000 for the year and want 10,000 new customers.
**Agent:** Step 1 complete with Objective: new customer acquisition, KPI: first-time purchasers, Target: 10,000 customers. Now Step 2 Economics.

With your $500K budget targeting 10,000 customers, that's $50 customer acquisition cost (CAC). 

What's your average order value for new customers?

### Turn 5
**User:** Our average order value is $85 and we have 40% gross margin.
**Agent:** Here's the thing - your economics need work. With $85 AOV and 40% margin, you make $34 gross profit per customer. But you're spending $50 to acquire each one. That's a $16 loss per customer.

Based on Knowledge Base benchmarks for DTC skincare, sustainable CAC typically runs 20-30% of AOV. For you, ...

**User:** Our target customer is women 25-45 interested in clean beauty and sustainability.
**Agent:** I hear you on audience - we'll dive deep into that in Step 3. But first, we need to solve the economics issue. You're losing $16 per customer with current targets.

Do you track repeat purchases or customer lifetime value beyond that first $85 order?

**User:** They shop at Sephora and Whole Foods, follow beauty influencers, and care about ingredients.
**Agent:** Those are great audience insights for later. Right now we're stuck on a math problem - you'll lose money on every customer acquired.

### Turn 9
**User:** No concentration - we want national coverage.
**Agent:** Got it on national coverage.
