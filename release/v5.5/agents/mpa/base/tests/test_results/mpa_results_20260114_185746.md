**Agent:** Here's the optimal budget split for your $150K:

**User:** Should we use ROAS as our primary metric?
**Agent:** No, ROAS isn't right for your primary metric here.

You're running lead generation, not direct sales. Your media campaign generates demos, but sales happen weeks later through your team. ROAS would require attributing all revenue back to specific ads, which gets messy with long B2B sales cycles.
