VERSION 5.8
EFFECTIVE DATE - JANUARY 2026
DOCUMENT TYPE - KNOWLEDGE BASE EXPERT GUIDANCE
COMPLIANCE - 6-RULE COMPLIANT

================================================================================
SECTION 1: PURPOSE AND SCOPE
================================================================================

1.1 PURPOSE

This document provides diagnostic reasoning patterns and expert-level guidance for audience strategy decisions. The agent MUST use this document to identify targeting issues, surface audience implications, validate sizing with census data, and produce activation-ready taxonomy codes.

1.2 SCOPE

This document covers:
- Critical audience considerations that determine success
- Common pitfalls with recommended alternatives
- Diagnostic signals indicating audience problems
- Audience overlap and segmentation guidance
- Census data validation requirements
- Platform taxonomy code requirements
- Questions worth asking that users may not consider
- Benchmark reference points for audience planning

================================================================================
SECTION 2: CRITICAL AUDIENCE CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

2.1 THE SEVEN CRITICAL AUDIENCE CONSIDERATIONS

CONSIDERATION 1: PRECISION VERSUS SCALE TRADEOFF
Narrow targeting increases relevance but limits reach. Broad targeting increases reach but reduces efficiency. The right balance depends on objectives and budget.

Why it matters: Too narrow wastes budget on high frequency to small audiences. Too broad wastes budget on irrelevant impressions.

CONSIDERATION 2: FIRST-PARTY DATA ADVANTAGE
First-party data enables the most precise and efficient targeting. Lookalike audiences from high-value customers typically outperform prospecting by 40-60 percent.

Why it matters: Advertisers with strong first-party data have significant competitive advantage. Those without must rely on less accurate platform signals.

CONSIDERATION 3: AUDIENCE QUALITY OVER QUANTITY
Not all impressions are equal. Reaching the right audience at lower volume beats reaching the wrong audience at high volume.

Why it matters: Poor audience targeting is the most common cause of campaign underperformance. Quality targeting dramatically improves efficiency.

CONSIDERATION 4: AUDIENCE OVERLAP ACROSS PLATFORMS
Different platforms often reach the same users. Without coordination, audiences receive excessive frequency or redundant targeting.

Why it matters: Unmanaged overlap wastes budget and can cause audience fatigue. Coordinated approach maximizes incremental reach.

CONSIDERATION 5: AUDIENCE EVOLUTION OVER TIME
Audiences are not static. Customer profiles change, new segments emerge, existing segments shrink or grow.

Why it matters: Audiences that worked historically may not work today. Regular audience refresh and testing maintains effectiveness.

CONSIDERATION 6: CENSUS-VALIDATED SIZING
Audience size estimates must be grounded in official population data. Guesses and estimates without census validation lead to flawed plans.

Why it matters: Over-estimated audiences lead to under-delivery. Under-estimated audiences lead to over-frequency and waste. Census data provides the factual foundation.

CONSIDERATION 7: ACTIVATION-READY OUTPUTS
Audience definitions without platform taxonomy codes require manual translation, introducing errors and delays.

Why it matters: Taxonomy codes enable direct activation in advertising platforms. Without them, audience definitions are incomplete and require additional work.

================================================================================
SECTION 3: COMMON PITFALLS
================================================================================

3.1 PITFALL: DEMOGRAPHIC-ONLY TARGETING

What it looks like:
- Audience defined only by age, gender, income
- No behavioral or intent signals included
- Assumption that demographics predict behavior

Why it matters:
- Demographics poorly predict purchase behavior
- Large portions of demographic audiences are irrelevant
- Better signals are available on most platforms

Better approach:
- Start with behavioral and intent signals
- Use demographics as secondary refinement
- Include Google In-Market and Meta Behaviors in targeting spec

3.2 PITFALL: AUDIENCE TOO NARROW FOR BUDGET

What it looks like:
- Small audience size with large budget
- Very high frequency delivery
- Rapid creative fatigue

Better approach:
- Match audience size to budget and duration using census data
- Set frequency caps
- Expand audience when frequency exceeds optimal

3.3 PITFALL: NO AUDIENCE SUPPRESSION

What it looks like:
- Acquisition campaigns reaching existing customers
- Retargeting reaching recent purchasers
- Wasted spend on wrong audience

Better approach:
- Upload customer suppression lists regularly
- Use platform exclusions for recent purchasers
- Monitor new-to-brand rate as quality check

3.4 PITFALL: AUDIENCE SIZE WITHOUT CENSUS VALIDATION

What it looks like:
- Round number estimates like 500K or 1M without methodology
- Platform reach estimates used without population base
- No geographic breakdown of audience sizing

Better approach:
- Always start with census population data
- Apply targeting filters with explicit percentages
- Show calculation chain from population to target audience
- Cite census source and year for all population figures

3.5 PITFALL: AUDIENCE DEFINITION WITHOUT TAXONOMY CODES

What it looks like:
- Natural language audience description only
- No platform-specific targeting parameters
- Activation team must interpret and translate

Better approach:
- Include IAB codes for contextual targeting
- Include Google Affinity and In-Market codes
- Include Meta Interests and Behaviors
- Include LinkedIn parameters for B2B
- Web search for current taxonomy codes

================================================================================
SECTION 4: DIAGNOSTIC SIGNALS
================================================================================

4.1 IF ACQUISITION COSTS ARE RISING

What to check:
- Is audience exhausted at current targeting
- Has competition increased
- Is creative fatigue occurring

Typical implications:
- May need to expand audience
- May need creative refresh
- May indicate market saturation

4.2 IF FREQUENCY IS VERY HIGH

What to check:
- Is audience too small for budget
- Are frequency caps in place
- Is same user being reached across platforms

Typical implications:
- Audience may be saturated
- Creative fatigue likely occurring
- Consider expanding audience or reducing budget

4.3 IF CUSTOMER QUALITY IS DECLINING

What to check:
- Has targeting changed
- Has audience composition shifted
- Are algorithms optimizing for volume over value

Typical implications:
- Targeting may need value-based adjustment
- Lookalike seeds may need updating
- Need to balance volume and quality objectives

================================================================================
SECTION 5: AUDIENCE SEGMENTATION GUIDANCE
================================================================================

5.1 PROSPECTING AUDIENCE TIERS

TIER 1: HIGH-VALUE LOOKALIKES
- Source: Top 10-20 percent customers by LTV
- Typical performance: Best efficiency, limited scale

TIER 2: BROAD LOOKALIKES
- Source: All customers or all converters
- Typical performance: Good efficiency, moderate scale

TIER 3: INTEREST AND BEHAVIOR
- Source: Platform interest and behavior signals
- Typical performance: Moderate efficiency, good scale
- Taxonomy: Google Affinity, Meta Interests

TIER 4: BROAD TARGETING
- Source: Minimal targeting, algorithm-driven
- Typical performance: Variable efficiency, maximum scale

5.2 AUDIENCE SIZING GUIDELINES

Minimum viable audience sizes by platform:
- Meta: 100,000 minimum for effective optimization
- Google Display: 100,000 minimum
- LinkedIn: 50,000 minimum
- TikTok: 100,000 minimum
- Programmatic: Varies by inventory, typically 100,000 plus

================================================================================
SECTION 6: CENSUS DATA VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

6.1 MANDATORY CENSUS VALIDATION

Every audience size estimate must be grounded in census data. The agent must web search for current population data before presenting audience sizing.

6.2 CALCULATION METHODOLOGY

Audience sizing must show the calculation chain:
- Step 1: Total population for geography from census
- Step 2: Apply demographic filters with percentages
- Step 3: Apply behavioral filters with percentages
- Step 4: Result is estimated target audience

6.3 CITATION REQUIREMENTS

Every population figure must cite:
- Source name (US Census ACS, Statistics Canada, ONS, etc.)
- Geographic level (DMA, state, CMA, region)
- Data year or range
- Table reference if applicable

================================================================================
SECTION 7: TAXONOMY CODE REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

7.1 ACTIVATION-READY OUTPUTS

Complete audience specifications must include platform taxonomy codes that enable direct activation.

7.2 REQUIRED TAXONOMY OUTPUTS

IAB Content Taxonomy for contextual targeting
- Format: IAB## or IAB##-## for subcategories

Google Affinity Audiences
- Format: /Affinity/Category/Subcategory

Google In-Market Audiences
- Format: /In-Market/Category/Subcategory

Meta Detailed Targeting
- Format: Interests, Behaviors, Demographics lists

LinkedIn Targeting (if B2B)
- Format: Job Titles, Functions, Industries, Seniority

7.3 WEB SEARCH FOR CURRENT CODES

The agent must web search for current taxonomy codes rather than relying on potentially outdated information.
