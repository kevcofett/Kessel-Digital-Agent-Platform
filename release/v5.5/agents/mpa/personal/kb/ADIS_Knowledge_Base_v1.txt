ANALYTICAL MODELS AVAILABLE

RFM SEGMENTATION
Recency Frequency Monetary analysis creates quintile-based scoring where each customer receives scores from 1 to 5 on three dimensions. Combined scores map to named segments including Champions, Loyal Customers, Potential Loyalists, New Customers, Promising, Customers Needing Attention, About To Sleep, At Risk, Cannot Lose Them, Hibernating, and Lost.

DECILE ANALYSIS
Value-based stratification divides customers into ten equal groups by total monetary value. Decile 10 contains highest-value customers while Decile 1 contains lowest-value customers. Analysis reveals Pareto concentration showing what percentage of value comes from top customer tiers.

COHORT ANALYSIS
Groups customers by first purchase period to measure retention over time. Creates retention matrices showing what percentage of each cohort remains active in subsequent periods. Enables vintage analysis comparing cohort quality across acquisition periods.

DETERMINISTIC CLV
Calculates Customer Lifetime Value using historical averages. Formula multiplies Average Order Value by Purchase Frequency by Expected Lifespan by Margin. Provides point estimates without confidence intervals.

PROBABILISTIC CLV
Uses BG/NBD and Gamma-Gamma models from the lifetimes library to predict future purchase behavior and monetary value. Accounts for customer dropout probability. Provides uncertainty estimates through prediction intervals.

BEHAVIORAL CLUSTERING
K-Means clustering groups customers by behavioral similarity across multiple dimensions. Automatically identifies optimal cluster count or accepts user specification. Outputs cluster assignments with distance-to-centroid scores indicating cluster membership strength.

PROPENSITY SCORING
Predicts likelihood of specific customer actions including purchase, churn, or response to campaign. Uses XGBoost classifier trained on historical conversion patterns. Outputs probability scores between 0 and 1 for targeting prioritization.


AUDIENCE CREATION WORKFLOW

STEP ONE - DATA UPLOAD
User uploads customer data file through Copilot conversation. System confirms receipt and initiates parsing.

STEP TWO - SCHEMA DETECTION
System automatically detects column types including customer identifiers, dates, monetary values, categories, and contact information. User confirms or corrects detected schema.

STEP THREE - MODEL SELECTION
Based on available data columns, system recommends appropriate analysis models. User selects models to run or accepts recommendations.

STEP FOUR - ANALYSIS EXECUTION
System runs selected models and returns segment distributions with summary statistics. User reviews results and segment composition.

STEP FIVE - AUDIENCE DEFINITION
User defines target audience by selecting segments, applying filters, or combining rules. System calculates audience size and value.

STEP SIX - CHANNEL RECOMMENDATION
System provides channel recommendations based on audience characteristics and segment affinity scores. Recommendations include rationale tied to segment behavior patterns.

STEP SEVEN - CAMPAIGN LINKAGE
User links audience to current media planning session. System stores association for performance tracking and future learning.


AMMO INTEGRATION - AUDIENCE-AWARE MEDIA MIX OPTIMIZATION

AMMO connects ADIS audience segments to budget allocation decisions through channel affinity scoring.

CHANNEL AFFINITY MATRIX
Each audience segment has effectiveness indices by channel. Index values above 1.0 indicate above-average expected response while values below 1.0 indicate below-average expected response.

Champions respond best to Email at 1.4x, Direct Mail at 1.5x, and CTV at 1.3x while responding below average to Linear TV at 0.8x and OOH at 0.7x.

At Risk customers respond best to Email at 1.5x and Direct Mail at 1.4x for retention campaigns while responding poorly to Paid Search at 0.8x.

New Customers respond best to Paid Social at 1.4x and Paid Search at 1.3x for acquisition while Direct Mail shows below-average response at 0.8x.

BUDGET OPTIMIZATION
AMMO runs constrained optimization across the audience by channel matrix to maximize expected response given budget constraints. Optimization accounts for diminishing returns through adstock decay parameters by channel.

SCENARIO ANALYSIS
System generates Conservative, Moderate, and Aggressive budget scenarios with expected outcomes for each. Calculates marginal returns between scenarios to identify optimal investment level.

CURRENT PLAN COMPARISON
When user has existing media plan, AMMO calculates expected lift from optimized allocation versus current allocation. Quantifies revenue and conversion improvement potential.


SEGMENT-TO-CHANNEL GUIDANCE

CHAMPIONS AND LOYAL CUSTOMERS
Prioritize personalized channels including Email, Loyalty Program communications, Premium Display, and Direct Mail. Avoid mass broadcast messaging. Focus messaging on exclusive offers and recognition.

POTENTIAL LOYALISTS
Nurture with consistent multi-channel presence across Email, Social Media, Retargeting, and Paid Search. Message focus on relationship building and program enrollment.

NEW CUSTOMERS
Emphasize Welcome Email sequences, Onboarding content, and Social Media engagement. Avoid aggressive upsell messaging in first 90 days. Focus on education and value demonstration.

AT RISK AND CANNOT LOSE THEM
Deploy Win-back Email campaigns, Special Offers, and high-touch Retargeting. For Cannot Lose Them segment add Direct Mail and Phone outreach. Avoid generic broadcast communication.

HIBERNATING AND LOST
Minimize spend on Lost segment which shows below-average response across all channels. Apply occasional low-cost win-back attempts only. Hibernating segment warrants moderate reactivation investment through Email and Discount Offers.


PERFORMANCE ATTRIBUTION

CLOSED LOOP TRACKING
After campaign execution, user can import actual performance data by audience and channel. System calculates actual versus expected variance.

MODEL LEARNING
Performance data feeds back into affinity score adjustments. Historical performance overweights base affinity scores for future optimization.

AUDIENCE VALUE TRACKING
System tracks which audiences were used in which campaigns with attributed results. Enables audience ROI reporting over time.


INTEGRATION WITH MEDIA PLANNING WORKFLOW

ADIS integrates with the standard 10-step media planning workflow at multiple points:

STEP 2 TARGET AUDIENCE
When user uploads customer data, ADIS segments inform target audience definition with specific segment recommendations rather than generic demographics.

STEP 4 CHANNEL MIX
Channel affinity scores from AMMO provide data-driven channel recommendations based on actual audience composition rather than industry averages.

STEP 5 BUDGET ALLOCATION
AMMO optimization allocates budget across channels with audience-aware efficiency rather than uniform distribution.

STEP 9 MEASUREMENT PLAN
Performance attribution framework defines what success metrics to track by audience segment.


DATA PRIVACY AND PII HANDLING

PERSONAL ENVIRONMENT
Full PII storage enabled for development and testing. Customer data stored in Dataverse with access controls.

MASTERCARD ENVIRONMENT
PII must be hashed using SHA-256 before storage. No raw email addresses, phone numbers, or identifying information stored in Dataverse. Hash-based matching supports platform audience exports.

PLATFORM EXPORTS
When exporting audiences for activation, system supports hashed formats required by Google Ads Customer Match, Meta Custom Audiences, and The Trade Desk.


ERROR HANDLING

FILE PARSING ERRORS
If file cannot be parsed, system returns specific error message identifying the issue. Common issues include password-protected files, corrupted formats, and unsupported encodings.

INSUFFICIENT DATA
If uploaded data lacks minimum required columns for analysis, system identifies missing elements and suggests alternatives.

MODEL FAILURES
If analytical model fails to converge or produces invalid results, system falls back to simpler methods and notifies user of limitations.


DATAVERSE TABLES

ADIS uses the following Dataverse tables prefixed with mpa:
- mpa_upload_job tracks file processing status
- mpa_data_schema stores detected column types
- mpa_customer_record stores normalized customer data
- mpa_model_run tracks analysis executions
- mpa_model_output stores per-customer results
- mpa_audience defines named audience segments
- mpa_audience_rule stores filtering criteria
- mpa_audience_member maps customers to audiences
- mpa_campaign_audience links audiences to media plans
- mpa_performance_linkage stores actual campaign results
- mpa_model_catalog lists available analysis models


CONVERSATION EXAMPLES

EXAMPLE ONE - BASIC RFM REQUEST

User: I have a spreadsheet with our customer transaction history. Can you analyze it to help with our media plan?

Agent: Absolutely. Please upload your customer transaction file and I will analyze it to create audience segments that inform your media planning decisions.

Once I receive your file, I will detect the data structure automatically and recommend appropriate analysis models based on the columns available. RFM analysis works best when your data includes customer IDs, transaction dates, and purchase amounts.

What file format is your data in?


EXAMPLE TWO - AUDIENCE-BASED OPTIMIZATION

User: Based on the RFM analysis, which customers should we prioritize for our holiday campaign?

Agent: For a holiday campaign, I recommend prioritizing three audience segments from your RFM results:

Champions representing 12 percent of customers but 34 percent of revenue - these customers respond best to Email and Direct Mail with exclusive early access offers.

Potential Loyalists representing 18 percent of customers showing strong recent engagement - target through Paid Social and Retargeting to convert them to Champions during the holiday period.

At Risk representing 8 percent of customers who were previously high-value - deploy win-back messaging through Email and personalized offers before they fully lapse.

Would you like me to run AMMO optimization to allocate your holiday budget across channels based on these audience segments?


EXAMPLE THREE - AMMO SCENARIO COMPARISON

User: Show me how different budget levels would perform for this audience mix.

Agent: I will run three budget scenarios through AMMO optimization for your audience composition:

Conservative scenario at $70,000 total budget projects $182,000 expected revenue with 160 percent ROI. Budget concentrates on highest-efficiency channels including Email and Retargeting.

Moderate scenario at $100,000 total budget projects $245,000 expected revenue with 145 percent ROI. Adds Paid Social and Programmatic Display to expand reach.

Aggressive scenario at $130,000 total budget projects $298,000 expected revenue with 129 percent ROI. Extends into CTV and broader programmatic for awareness.

Marginal returns analysis shows the investment from Conservative to Moderate yields 210 percent return on the additional $30,000. The investment from Moderate to Aggressive yields 177 percent return on the additional $30,000.

My recommendation is the Moderate scenario which balances strong ROI with meaningful revenue growth. Would you like to see the detailed channel allocation for this scenario?
