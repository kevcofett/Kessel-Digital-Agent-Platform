AUDIENCE DATA INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM USER GUIDE

VERSION 1.0

OVERVIEW

The Audience Data Intelligence System enables users to upload customer data files and transform them into actionable audience segments for media planning. ADIS analyzes transaction histories, engagement metrics, loyalty data, and CRM exports to create intelligent audience definitions that inform channel selection and budget allocation.

Users must understand that ADIS operates within their existing media planning workflow. The system does not replace strategic thinking but rather enhances it with data-driven audience insights.

FILE UPLOAD CAPABILITIES

ADIS accepts the following file formats for customer data ingestion:

- Excel files including xlsx and xls formats with single or multiple sheets
- CSV files with standard comma or semicolon delimiters
- Word documents containing embedded data tables
- PDF documents with extractable tabular content
- PowerPoint files with data tables in slides

Maximum file size is 250 megabytes which aligns with SharePoint limits. Files exceeding this threshold must be split before upload.

Users must ensure uploaded files contain at minimum a customer identifier column and at least one behavioral or transactional column. Files without identifiable customer keys cannot be processed for audience segmentation.

DATA REQUIREMENTS BY ANALYSIS TYPE

RFM ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS

RFM analysis requires three specific data elements:

- Customer identifier allowing unique customer recognition across transactions
- Transaction date indicating when each purchase or engagement occurred
- Monetary value representing the financial amount of each transaction

The system automatically detects these columns based on naming patterns and data characteristics. Confidence scores indicate detection reliability.

DECILE ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS

Decile analysis requires:

- Customer identifier for grouping transactions by customer
- Value metric such as revenue or lifetime value for ranking

COHORT ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS

Cohort analysis requires:

- Customer identifier for tracking individual customers over time
- Transaction or engagement dates for determining cohort membership and activity periods

CLV ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS

Customer Lifetime Value analysis requires:

- Customer identifier for individual customer tracking
- Transaction dates for calculating recency and frequency
- Monetary values for determining average order value and total spend

Probabilistic CLV models additionally benefit from longer transaction histories spanning at least six months.

CLUSTERING ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS

Behavioral clustering requires:

- At minimum two numeric attributes for meaningful cluster differentiation
- Customer identifier if customer-level clusters are desired
- Larger datasets of at least 500 records produce more reliable clusters

SCHEMA INFERENCE

Upon file upload ADIS automatically analyzes column contents to infer semantic types. The system examines:

- Column names for pattern matching against known field types
- Sample values for format detection including email patterns phone formats and date structures
- Statistical characteristics including uniqueness ratios and null percentages
- Data distributions to identify categorical versus continuous variables

Detected types include:

- CUSTOMER_ID for unique customer identifiers
- TRANSACTION_ID for unique transaction identifiers
- EMAIL for electronic mail addresses
- PHONE for telephone numbers
- DATE for temporal values
- CURRENCY for monetary amounts
- CATEGORY for categorical classifications
- NUMERIC for continuous numeric values
- TEXT for free-form text content
- ENGAGEMENT_SCORE for behavioral scoring metrics
- LOYALTY_TIER for membership level classifications

Users must verify detected schemas before proceeding with analysis. Override capability exists for correcting misidentified column types.

ANALYSIS MODEL SELECTION

ADIS provides multiple analytical models. Selection depends on business objectives and data availability.

RFM MODEL

Use RFM analysis when the goal is customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior. RFM produces segments including:

- Champions representing highest value most frequent most recent customers
- Loyal Customers representing consistent purchasers with strong engagement
- Potential Loyalists representing recent customers showing promise for development
- New Customers representing recent first-time purchasers
- At Risk representing previously good customers showing decline
- Cannot Lose Them representing high-value customers at risk of churn
- Hibernating representing inactive customers with some historical value
- Lost representing long-inactive low-value customers

Each customer receives scores from 1 to 5 for Recency Frequency and Monetary dimensions. Combined scores map to named segments.

DECILE MODEL

Use Decile analysis when the goal is value-based stratification. This model divides customers into ten equal-sized groups ranked by a chosen value metric. Results reveal value concentration patterns including what percentage of value the top decile represents.

COHORT MODEL

Use Cohort analysis when the goal is understanding retention patterns over time. This model groups customers by their acquisition period and tracks subsequent activity. Results include retention matrices showing percentage of each cohort remaining active in subsequent periods.

CLV MODELS

Use deterministic CLV when transaction history is limited or when simple projections suffice. The model applies average order value multiplied by purchase frequency multiplied by estimated lifespan multiplied by margin.

Use probabilistic CLV via BG-NBD model when transaction history spans at least six months and when statistical rigor is required. This model accounts for customer dropout probability and produces confidence intervals around predictions.

CLUSTERING MODEL

Use K-Means clustering when the goal is discovering behavioral segments without predefined categories. The model groups customers based on multiple numeric attributes. Users specify desired cluster count or allow automatic selection based on optimization metrics.

AUDIENCE CREATION

After analysis completes users create audiences by selecting model outputs and optionally applying filtering rules.

RULE-BASED FILTERING

Rules support the following operators:

- EQUALS for exact match filtering
- NOT_EQUALS for exclusion filtering
- GREATER_THAN and GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL for numeric thresholds
- LESS_THAN and LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL for numeric ceilings
- IN and NOT_IN for list-based inclusion or exclusion
- BETWEEN for range filtering
- CONTAINS for substring matching
- IS_NULL and IS_NOT_NULL for presence filtering

Rules combine using AND or OR logic with grouping support for complex expressions.

AUDIENCE RECOMMENDATIONS

The system automatically generates:

- Recommended channels based on segment characteristics and historical affinity patterns
- Suggested use cases identifying appropriate campaign types for the audience
- Value concentration metrics showing revenue distribution across members

Users should treat recommendations as starting points requiring strategic validation rather than prescriptive directives.

AMMO BUDGET OPTIMIZATION

The Audience-Aware Media Mix Optimization framework connects audiences to budget allocation decisions.

AFFINITY MATRIX

AMMO maintains channel effectiveness indices by audience segment. Champions typically show elevated response to Email Direct Mail and Premium Display. At Risk segments respond better to personalized retargeting and win-back messaging than to broad reach channels.

OPTIMIZATION PROCESS

Users provide:

- Total budget for the campaign
- Audiences to target
- Channels under consideration
- Any channel-specific constraints including minimums and maximums
- Optimization objective selecting from ROI Revenue or Conversions

AMMO produces:

- Optimal budget allocation percentages by channel
- Expected impressions conversions and revenue by channel
- Expected ROI for the recommended allocation
- Comparison against current allocation if provided showing expected lift

SCENARIO ANALYSIS

Users can run multiple budget scenarios to understand marginal returns. Conservative moderate and aggressive scenarios reveal diminishing return patterns and inform budget negotiation.

PERFORMANCE ATTRIBUTION

After campaign execution users import actual performance data to close the measurement loop.

IMPORT REQUIREMENTS

Performance data must include:

- Audience or campaign identifier for matching
- Channel identification
- Measurement date
- Actual metrics including spend impressions clicks conversions and revenue

ATTRIBUTION OUTPUTS

The system calculates:

- Variance between expected and actual performance by audience and channel
- Updated affinity scores based on observed results
- Recommendations for future targeting based on performance patterns

ENVIRONMENT CONSIDERATIONS

PERSONAL ENVIRONMENT

The Aragorn AI environment provides full ADIS capabilities including all analytical models web search for benchmark enrichment and unrestricted Azure Function execution.

MASTERCARD ENVIRONMENT

The Mastercard corporate environment operates with specific constraints:

- No external API access requiring all benchmarks to be pre-loaded
- PII handling requires hashing or masking before storage
- Only pre-approved Python libraries available in Azure Functions
- All data remains within managed tenant boundaries

Users must ensure uploaded data complies with corporate data handling policies before initiating analysis.

BEST PRACTICES

DATA PREPARATION

- Clean data before upload removing duplicate transactions and correcting obvious errors
- Ensure consistent date formats across transaction records
- Verify customer identifiers are truly unique and consistent over time
- Include sufficient transaction history spanning at least three months for meaningful RFM analysis

ANALYSIS SELECTION

- Start with RFM for initial customer understanding when transaction data is available
- Use Decile analysis when comparing value tiers against marketing investment
- Apply Cohort analysis when retention questions drive the investigation
- Reserve probabilistic CLV for mature datasets with extended history

AUDIENCE DESIGN

- Create audiences with clear use cases rather than generic segments
- Size audiences appropriately for intended channels considering minimum match requirements
- Document audience logic for future reference and reproducibility
- Version audiences when updating to maintain historical comparability

OPTIMIZATION APPLICATION

- Validate AMMO recommendations against strategic intent before adoption
- Use scenario analysis to understand budget sensitivity
- Compare optimized allocations to current plans to quantify improvement opportunity
- Update affinity matrices with actual performance to improve future recommendations

ERROR HANDLING

Common errors and resolutions:

FILE PROCESSING FAILURES

- Verify file is not password protected or corrupted
- Ensure file size is within 250 megabyte limit
- Check that file contains actual data rows not just headers
- Confirm file format matches extension

SCHEMA DETECTION ISSUES

- Manually override detected types when automatic inference fails
- Ensure columns have consistent data within each column
- Remove merged cells or complex formatting from Excel files

ANALYSIS FAILURES

- Verify required columns are present and correctly mapped
- Ensure minimum record counts are met for selected model
- Check for excessive null values in required fields

AUDIENCE CREATION ISSUES
