================================================================================

SECTION 5 - AI CAMPAIGN VALIDATION FRAMEWORK

WHY VALIDATION MATTERS

Platform-reported metrics for AI-powered campaigns often overstate true performance:

- Self-attribution bias credits platform touchpoints
- Modeled conversions may include non-incremental sales
- Audience expansion may reach customers who would have converted anyway
- Reported ROAS typically 2 to 3x higher than incremental ROAS

VALIDATION APPROACHES

Incrementality Testing
- Geo-based holdout tests isolate true campaign impact
- Ghost bidding measures baseline without exposure
- PSA testing controls for targeting without message effect
- Required for accurate budget allocation decisions

Recommended Testing Cadence
- Quarterly for ongoing campaigns
- Before scaling any AI-powered campaign
- When making significant budget changes
- After major platform or campaign structure updates

A/B Testing Against Manual Campaigns
- Run parallel standard campaigns for comparison
- Isolate AI-driven improvements from other factors
- Measure incrementality for both approaches
- Consider total cost including management overhead

Cross-Platform Comparison
- Compare platform-reported results across channels
- Use holdout testing to validate each platform
- Identify discrepancies indicating measurement issues
- Apply consistent methodology across platforms

Media Mix Modeling Integration
- Include AI campaign spend in MMM analysis
- Validate MMM coefficients against incrementality tests
- Use MMM for cross-channel budget allocation
- Reconcile differences between approaches

VALIDATION METRICS

Primary Validation Metrics
- Incremental ROAS (iROAS) - True incremental revenue divided by spend
- Lift percentage - Exposed versus control group performance difference
- Cost per incremental acquisition - Spend divided by true incremental customers

Secondary Validation Metrics
- New-to-brand rate - Indicator of expansion versus retention
- Search brand query volume - Leading indicator of awareness impact
- Cross-channel sales impact - Total business impact beyond direct response

Red Flags Indicating Measurement Issues
- ROAS significantly higher than historical norms
- ROAS inconsistent with business results
- New-to-brand rate suspiciously low
- Claimed performance increases without business result changes
