FIRST-PARTY DATA STRATEGY GUIDE
VERSION: 5.5
DATE: January 2026
STATUS: Production Ready
COMPLIANCE: 6-Rule Compliant
================================================================================

PURPOSE

This document provides comprehensive guidance on first-party data strategy for media planning and activation. Despite third-party cookies remaining active in Chrome, first-party data has become the foundation of effective marketing due to privacy regulations, consumer expectations, and platform signal loss. This guide enables recommendations for data collection, organization, activation, and privacy-compliant usage.

================================================================================

SECTION 1 - FIRST-PARTY DATA FUNDAMENTALS

WHAT IS FIRST-PARTY DATA

First-party data is information collected directly from customers and prospects through owned touchpoints with consent. This includes:

Direct Collection Sources
- Website and app interactions
- Purchase and transaction history
- Customer account information
- Email and communication engagement
- Customer service interactions
- Loyalty program participation
- In-store behavior where tracked

Characteristics
- Owned by the collecting organization
- Collected with user knowledge or consent
- Most accurate and reliable data type
- Subject to privacy regulations
- Requires infrastructure to collect, store, and activate

WHY FIRST-PARTY DATA MATTERS

Privacy Landscape Context
- Third-party cookies blocked in Safari and Firefox (approximately 21 percent of traffic)
- Chrome users can opt out of third-party cookies
- Regulatory requirements (GDPR, CCPA) restrict third-party data usage
- Consumer privacy expectations continue rising
- Platform signal loss from app tracking transparency

Marketing Effectiveness
- Deterministic matching to known customers
- Higher accuracy than modeled or probabilistic data
- Better personalization drives improved outcomes
- Owned asset not subject to platform policy changes
- Foundation for customer lifetime value optimization

Competitive Advantage
- Proprietary data creates differentiation
- Enables personalization competitors cannot replicate
- Reduces dependency on third-party data providers
- Supports direct customer relationships

FIRST-PARTY VERSUS OTHER DATA TYPES

First-Party Data
- Collected directly from your customers
- Highest accuracy and reliability
- Requires consent and privacy compliance
- Most valuable but requires infrastructure investment

Zero-Party Data
- Explicitly provided by customers
- Includes preferences, intentions, and context
- Highest trust indicator
- Subset of first-party data

Second-Party Data
- Another organization's first-party data shared directly
- Higher quality than third-party but limited scale
- Requires partnership agreements
- Common in data clean room partnerships

Third-Party Data
- Aggregated from multiple sources by data providers
- Broader scale but lower accuracy
- Privacy compliance more challenging
- Declining availability and effectiveness

================================================================================
