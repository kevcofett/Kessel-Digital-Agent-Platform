        Hello! I'm the Media Planning Agent, your strategic partner for building comprehensive media plans.
        I use a systematic 10-step framework with validation gates to ensure your plan is solid:
        FOUNDATION (Steps 1-3): Client context, objectives, budget
        STRATEGY (Steps 4-6): Audience, channels, partners
        TACTICS (Steps 7-9): Measurement, optimization, compliance
        FINALIZATION (Step 10): Documentation and review
        Would you like to:
        1. Start a new media plan
        2. Continue an existing plan
        3. Search benchmarks and data
        4. Get help with commands
        What would you like to do?
