SECTION 1 - CALCULATIONS BY PLANNING STEP
================================================================================

STEP 1 - MARKET AND CONTEXT

MARKET SIZE CALCULATION
Total_Addressable_Market = Category_Buyers x Average_Transaction_Value x Purchase_Frequency

SHARE OF VOICE CALCULATION
SOV = Brand_Spend / Total_Category_Spend x 100

SHARE OF MARKET CORRELATION
Research shows SOV must exceed SOM for growth.
Growth_Premium = SOV - SOM
If Growth_Premium positive: Brand likely to gain share

STEP 2 - OBJECTIVES AND KPIS

TARGET VALIDATION
Compare target against vertical benchmarks.
Deviation_Percent = (Target - Benchmark) / Benchmark x 100

CHALLENGE THRESHOLD
If Deviation_Percent greater than 20 percent: Flag as aggressive
If Deviation_Percent greater than 50 percent: Flag as very aggressive, require justification

CONVERSION FUNNEL CALCULATION
Conversions = Impressions x CTR x CVR
Required_Impressions = Target_Conversions / (CTR x CVR)
Required_Budget = Required_Impressions x CPM / 1000

STEP 3 - BUDGET AND TIMELINE

DAILY BUDGET CALCULATION
Daily_Budget = Total_Budget / Campaign_Days

PACING CHECK
Daily_Required = Remaining_Budget / Remaining_Days
Pacing_Index = Actual_Daily_Spend / Daily_Required
If Pacing_Index less than 0.9: Underpacing
If Pacing_Index greater than 1.1: Overpacing

WORKING MEDIA PERCENTAGE
Working_Media_Percent = (Budget - Agency_Fees - Tech_Fees - Data_Fees) / Budget x 100
Minimum acceptable: 60 percent
Target: 70 percent or higher

STEP 4 - AUDIENCE DEFINITION

ADDRESSABLE AUDIENCE CALCULATION
Addressable_Audience = Total_Population x Demographic_Match_Rate x Behavioral_Match_Rate

AUDIENCE OVERLAP CALCULATION
If Audience_A and Audience_B overlap:
Unique_Combined_Reach = Audience_A + Audience_B - (Audience_A x Audience_B / Total_Universe)

FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION
Using binomial distribution for n exposures:
P(k exposures) = C(n,k) x p^k x (1 - p)^(n - k)

STEP 5 - CHANNEL STRATEGY

CHANNEL ALLOCATION FORMULA
Channel_Budget = Total_Budget x Channel_Weight x Efficiency_Adjustment

EFFICIENCY ADJUSTMENT
Based on response curve position:
If Marginal_ROI greater than Average: Weight up
If Marginal_ROI less than Average: Weight down

CROSS-CHANNEL REACH
Combined_Reach = 1 - Product of (1 - Reach_i) for all channels i

STEP 6 - PARTNER SELECTION

NET WORKING MEDIA
NWM = Budget - DSP_Fee - SSP_Fee - Verification_Fee - Data_Fee - Other_Fees

NET BENEFIT INDEX
NBI = (Fee_Savings_Percent - Quality_Impact_Percent) x Relevance_Weight

STEP 7 - MEASUREMENT APPROACH

MINIMUM HOLDOUT SIZE
For 95 percent confidence and 80 percent power:
Holdout_Size = 2.8 x (Variance / Effect_Size^2)

STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE
Z_Score = (Test_Mean - Control_Mean) / Standard_Error
If Z_Score greater than 1.96: Significant at 95 percent

STEP 8 - OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY

OPTIMIZATION TRIGGER THRESHOLDS
- CPM variance greater than 20 percent: Review creative or targeting
- CTR variance greater than 30 percent: Review creative
- CVR variance greater than 25 percent: Review landing page
- CPA variance greater than 15 percent: Review full funnel

STEP 9 - COMPLIANCE AND BRAND SAFETY

VIEWABILITY ADJUSTMENT
Effective_Impressions = Total_Impressions x Viewability_Rate
Adjusted_CPM = Paid_CPM / Viewability_Rate

FRAUD ADJUSTMENT
Clean_Impressions = Total_Impressions x (1 - IVT_Rate)
Adjusted_CPM = Paid_CPM / (1 - IVT_Rate)

STEP 10 - FINAL PROJECTION

FINAL PROJECTION FORMULA
Projected_Outcome = Sum of (Channel_Contribution_i) for all channels
Where: Channel_Contribution_i = f(Spend_i, Response_Curve_i, Adstock_i, Seasonal_Factor)

CONFIDENCE INTERVAL
Lower_Bound = Projection x (1 - Uncertainty_Percent)
Upper_Bound = Projection x (1 + Uncertainty_Percent)

SCENARIO COMPARISON
Always present base case, optimistic, and conservative scenarios.

================================================================================
SECTION 2 - CONFIDENCE LEVEL METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

CONFIDENCE LEVEL DEFINITIONS

HIGH CONFIDENCE
- Source: Internal benchmarks validated by recent performance data
- Variance: Plus or minus 10 percent
- Criteria: Same vertical, same objective, same channels, within past 12 months

MEDIUM CONFIDENCE
- Source: Industry benchmarks from authoritative sources
- Variance: Plus or minus 20 percent
- Criteria: Same vertical, similar objective, validated methodology

MEDIUM-LOW CONFIDENCE
- Source: Cross-vertical extrapolation or dated benchmarks
- Variance: Plus or minus 30 percent
- Criteria: Related vertical or older than 18 months

LOW CONFIDENCE
- Source: Web research, estimates, or limited data
- Variance: Plus or minus 40 percent or greater
- Criteria: Unvalidated or novel approach

CONFIDENCE ASSIGNMENT BY DATA TYPE

METRIC - CPM PROJECTIONS
- Historical same campaign: HIGH
- Same vertical benchmark: MEDIUM
- Cross-vertical estimate: MEDIUM-LOW
- Web research: LOW

METRIC - CTR PROJECTIONS
- Same creative type, same platform: HIGH
- Same platform, different creative: MEDIUM
- Different platform, similar format: MEDIUM-LOW
- New format or channel: LOW

METRIC - CONVERSION RATE PROJECTIONS
- Same landing page, same audience: HIGH
- Same audience, new page: MEDIUM
- New audience: MEDIUM-LOW
- New vertical: LOW

METRIC - TOTAL CONVERSIONS
- Based on HIGH confidence inputs: MEDIUM (compounding uncertainty)
- Based on MEDIUM inputs: MEDIUM-LOW
- Based on LOW inputs: LOW

CONFIDENCE COMMUNICATION

AGENT MUST ALWAYS
- State confidence level for every projection
- Explain basis for confidence level
- Provide range, not just point estimate
- Offer to improve confidence with additional data

EXAMPLE OUTPUT
Based on vertical benchmarks (MEDIUM confidence), I project 1500 conversions.
Range: 1200 to 1800 conversions (plus or minus 20 percent).
To improve confidence, I would need your historical campaign performance data.
