SECTION 1 - IDENTITY RESOLUTION FUNDAMENTALS
================================================================================

IDENTITY RESOLUTION DEFINITION

Identity resolution links disparate data points and identifiers to create a unified view of individuals across devices, channels, and time.

WHY IDENTITY MATTERS
- Cross-device targeting and measurement
- Frequency management
- Customer journey understanding
- Personalization at scale
- Attribution accuracy

IDENTITY CHALLENGES
- Cookie deprecation
- Mobile identifier restrictions (ATT)
- Cross-platform fragmentation
- Privacy regulations
- Walled garden limitations

IDENTIFIER TYPES

DETERMINISTIC IDENTIFIERS
Exact, known identifiers.
- Hashed email address
- Hashed phone number
- Login credentials
- Customer ID

PROBABILISTIC IDENTIFIERS
Inferred connections based on signals.
- Device fingerprinting
- IP-based inference
- Behavioral patterns
- Location signals

DEVICE IDENTIFIERS
Platform-specific device tokens.
- Apple IDFA (requires ATT consent)
- Google GAID (Privacy Sandbox evolving)
- CTV device IDs
- Household IDs

PLATFORM IDENTIFIERS
Walled garden user IDs.
- Google User ID
- Meta User ID
- Amazon Customer ID
- Not portable across platforms

================================================================================
SECTION 2 - DETERMINISTIC MATCHING
================================================================================

DETERMINISTIC APPROACH

Deterministic matching uses exact identifier matches for highest accuracy.

HOW IT WORKS
1. User provides identifier (email, phone)
2. Identifier is hashed for privacy
3. Hash compared to other datasets
4. Exact match confirms same person

COMMON DETERMINISTIC IDENTIFIERS

HASHED EMAIL
- Most widely used identifier
- SHA-256 hashing standard
- Requires user to provide email
- Match rates: 40-70% typical

HASHED PHONE
- Growing in importance
- Multiple formats (normalize first)
- Often used with email
- Match rates: 30-50% typical

LOGIN DATA
- Highest accuracy
- Limited to authenticated environments
- First-party or partner data
- Essential for walled gardens

MATCH RATE FACTORS

DATA QUALITY
- Email validity
- Standardization (lowercase, trim)
- Recency of data
- Complete vs partial records

PLATFORM COVERAGE
- User base overlap
- Identifier availability
- Authentication rates
- Geographic factors

DETERMINISTIC ADVANTAGES
- High accuracy (95%+ when matched)
- Privacy-friendly (hashed)
- Durable over time
- Regulatory compliant

DETERMINISTIC LIMITATIONS
- Lower match rates
- Requires user-provided data
- Cross-platform gaps
- Not real-time collection

================================================================================
SECTION 3 - PROBABILISTIC MATCHING
================================================================================

PROBABILISTIC APPROACH

Probabilistic matching infers identity connections using signals and statistical models.

HOW IT WORKS
1. Collect multiple signals
2. Build probability model
3. Calculate match likelihood
4. Apply confidence threshold
5. Link records above threshold

- Medium confidence: 70-85%
- Low confidence: 50-70%
- Threshold depends on use case

ACCURACY CONSIDERATIONS
- False positive risk
- False negative risk
- Varies by signal quality
- Degrades over time

PROBABILISTIC ADVANTAGES
- Higher match rates
- No direct identifier needed
- Real-time capable
