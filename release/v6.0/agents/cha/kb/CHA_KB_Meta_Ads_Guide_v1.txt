CREATIVE DIVERSITY
- Vary: Hooks, visuals, formats, CTAs
- Test: UGC vs polished, lifestyle vs product
- Include: Various aspect ratios for all placements

CREATIVE TESTING FRAMEWORK
1. Test concepts (different messages/angles)
2. Winner gets iteration testing
3. Iterate on winning elements
4. Always have new concepts in pipeline

FATIGUE INDICATORS
- CTR declining week-over-week
- Frequency rising above 3-4
- CPM increasing without competitive cause
- Relevance diagnostics declining

CONVERSIONS API (CAPI)

PURPOSE
Server-side event tracking to supplement pixel.

================================================================================
SECTION 4 - BIDDING AND OPTIMIZATION
================================================================================

BID STRATEGIES

LOWEST COST (AUTOMATIC)
- Maximize results within budget
- No bid cap set
- Best for: Learning phase, stable performance
- Risk: Costs may rise with competition

COST CAP
- Target average cost per result
- May limit delivery if cap too low
- Best for: Strict efficiency requirements
- Set 10-20% above target initially

BID CAP
- Maximum bid per auction
- Most control, most restrictive
- Best for: Advanced advertisers
- Risk: Significant delivery limitations

MINIMUM ROAS
- Target return on ad spend
- Requires value optimization
- Best for: Ecommerce with known margins
- Note: Uses revenue/spend calculation

OPTIMIZATION GOALS

CONVERSION OPTIMIZATION HIERARCHY
- Purchase (strongest signal)
- Add to cart
- Initiate checkout
- View content
- Page view (weakest)

OPTIMIZATION SELECTION
- Optimize for closest to revenue
- Need 50+ events per week per ad set
- If insufficient, move up funnel temporarily

VALUE OPTIMIZATION
- Optimize for highest value conversions
- Requires passing value with events
- Best for: Variable order values

LEARNING PHASE

LEARNING PHASE DEFINITION
- Initial period for algorithm optimization
- Requires approximately 50 optimization events
- Performance less stable during learning

EXITING LEARNING
- Achieve 50 events in 7 days
- Avoid significant edits during learning
- Consolidate ad sets if struggling

LEARNING LIMITED
- Insufficient events to exit learning
- Causes: Budget too low, audience too small, optimization event too rare
- Solutions: Increase budget, broaden audience, change optimization

================================================================================
SECTION 5 - CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE STRATEGY
================================================================================

SIMPLIFIED STRUCTURE (RECOMMENDED)

CAMPAIGN CONSOLIDATION
- Fewer campaigns with larger budgets
- Algorithm benefits from data consolidation
- Easier management and optimization

RECOMMENDED STRUCTURE
- 1-3 campaigns per objective
- 1-5 ad sets per campaign
- 3-10 ads per ad set

AD SET STRATEGY

BROAD TARGETING AD SET
- Minimal detailed targeting
- Let algorithm find converters
- Best for: ASC and large budgets

INTEREST-BASED AD SET
- Detailed targeting for guidance
- Advantage expansion enabled
- Good for: Mid-size budgets

REMARKETING AD SET
- Website visitors, engagers
- Lower funnel, higher intent
- Separate from prospecting

LOOKALIKE AD SET
- Seed from best customers
- 1-5% size typical
- Test against broad

BUDGET STRUCTURE

CAMPAIGN BUDGET OPTIMIZATION (CBO)
- Budget set at campaign level
- Automatically allocates across ad sets
- Best for: Similar value ad sets
- Minimum per ad set may be needed

AD SET BUDGET (ABO)
- Budget controlled per ad set
- More control, less flexibility
- Best for: Testing, different values

HYBRID APPROACH
- CBO for scaling campaigns
- ABO for testing new audiences/creative

================================================================================
SECTION 6 - MEASUREMENT AND ATTRIBUTION
================================================================================

ATTRIBUTION SETTINGS

CLICK-THROUGH WINDOW
- 1-day, 7-day (default), or 28-day
- Match to actual purchase cycle
- Shorter windows reduce reported conversions

VIEW-THROUGH WINDOW
- 1-day (default) or none
- View-through often incremental
- Consider for full-funnel view

ATTRIBUTION SETTING IMPACT
- Affects reported conversions
- Affects algorithm optimization
- Be consistent for comparison

IOS 14+ CONSIDERATIONS

AGGREGATED EVENT MEASUREMENT
- Limited to 8 conversion events per domain
- Events ranked by priority
- Delayed reporting (up to 72 hours)

APP TRACKING TRANSPARENCY
- Users must opt-in to tracking
- Modeling fills measurement gaps
- Focus on modeled conversions

MITIGATION STRATEGIES
- Implement CAPI for improved signal
- Use EMQ to maximize match quality
- Rely on platform modeling
- Supplement with incrementality testing

REPORTING METRICS

CORE METRICS
- Results (conversions at campaign level)
- Cost per result
- ROAS (platform calculation)
- Frequency
- Reach

DIAGNOSTIC METRICS
- CTR (link and outbound)
- CPM
- Landing page views
- Quality ranking
- Engagement rate ranking

BREAKDOWN ANALYSIS
- Placement breakdown (feed vs stories vs reels)
- Platform breakdown (Facebook vs Instagram)
- Device breakdown
- Time breakdown (day, week)

================================================================================
SECTION 7 - AGENT APPLICATION GUIDANCE
================================================================================

CAMPAIGN RECOMMENDATIONS BY GOAL

ECOMMERCE SALES
1. Advantage Plus Shopping (primary scale)
2. Remarketing (cart abandoners, viewers)
3. Catalog sales (dynamic retargeting)
4. Broad prospecting (if ASC maxed)

LEAD GENERATION
1. Lead ads (native forms)
2. Website conversion (landing page)
3. Remarketing (form abandoners)
4. Lookalike prospecting

AWARENESS
1. Reach campaign (controlled frequency)
2. Video views (for video assets)
3. Engagement (social proof building)

BUDGET RECOMMENDATIONS

MINIMUM BUDGETS
- Testing: $50-100/day per ad set minimum
- Scaling: $200+/day for ASC
- Learning phase: Plan for 50 conversions at target CPA

SCALING APPROACH
- Increase budgets by 20% maximum per change
- Allow 3-5 days between increases
- Monitor for efficiency changes
- Have cost caps ready if needed

WARNING SIGNS
- CPM rising more than 30% without cause
- Frequency above 4-5 in 7 days (prospecting)
- CTR declining week-over-week
- Learning limited status persisting
- ROAS declining despite stable creative

PLATFORM-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE
- Meta ROAS uses revenue/spend formula
- Adjust reported ROAS by subtracting 1 for true return
- Example: Meta reports 4.0x ROAS = 3.0x actual ROAS
