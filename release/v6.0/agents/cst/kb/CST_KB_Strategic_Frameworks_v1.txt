STRATEGIC ANALYSIS FRAMEWORKS

SWOT ANALYSIS APPLICATION

Purpose
Assess strategic position by examining internal strengths and weaknesses plus external opportunities and threats.

When to Use SWOT

- Initial strategic assessment for any organization or initiative
- Evaluating fit between capabilities and market conditions
- Setting strategic priorities based on position
- Comparing strategic options

Application Process

Step 1 - Gather Input
Conduct interviews with stakeholders across functions. Review performance data and market research. Compile competitive intelligence. Gather customer feedback and market trends.

Step 2 - Identify Strengths
Focus on capabilities that provide competitive advantage. Ask what do we do better than competitors. Consider resources, skills, reputation, and assets. Require evidence for each strength claimed.

Step 3 - Identify Weaknesses
Focus on limitations that hinder performance. Ask where do we underperform or lack capability. Consider resource gaps, skill deficits, and structural issues. Be honest rather than defensive.

Step 4 - Identify Opportunities
Focus on external conditions favorable for growth. Ask what market trends or changes could benefit us. Consider technology shifts, regulatory changes, and market gaps. Ensure opportunities are real not wishful thinking.

Step 5 - Identify Threats
Focus on external conditions that pose risk. Ask what could harm our business or strategy. Consider competitive actions, market changes, and regulatory risks. Distinguish imminent from distant threats.

Step 6 - Prioritize and Analyze
Rank items by importance and impact. Look for patterns across quadrants. Identify strategic implications. Develop strategic combinations.

Strategic Combinations

SO Strategies - Use strengths to capture opportunities
WO Strategies - Address weaknesses to capture opportunities
ST Strategies - Use strengths to mitigate threats
WT Strategies - Address weaknesses to avoid threats

Output Format
