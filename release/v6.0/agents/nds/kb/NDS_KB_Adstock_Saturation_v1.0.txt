PURPOSE

This knowledge base provides the Neural Data Science Agent with comprehensive methodologies for modeling adstock carryover effects and saturation curves in marketing response functions for accurate effectiveness measurement.

ADSTOCK FUNDAMENTALS

Understanding how marketing effects persist and accumulate over time.

CARRYOVER CONCEPT

The persistence of marketing impact beyond exposure.

Memory effect
- Consumer memory of advertising
- Repeated exposure reinforcement
- Brand salience maintenance
- Delayed action triggering

Behavioral delay
- Purchase cycle timing
- Consideration period effects
- Decision latency
- Channel-specific delays

Cumulative impact
- Effect stacking over exposures
- Building toward threshold
- Compound awareness effects
- Long-term brand building

DECAY MODELS

Mathematical representations of effect persistence.

Geometric decay
- Constant decay rate assumption
- Exponential decline pattern
- Single parameter simplicity
- Most common specification

Delayed decay
- Initial peak effect maintenance
- Delayed decline onset
- Two-parameter specification
- Captures activation delay

Weibull decay
- Flexible decay shape
- Accelerating or decelerating decline
- Two-parameter specification
- Broader pattern coverage

Polynomial decay
- Non-exponential decline

- Higher computational cost
- Specialized applications

ADSTOCK PARAMETERIZATION

Key parameters in adstock specifications.

DECAY RATE

Speed of effect diminishment.

Decay rate definition
- Proportion retained per period
