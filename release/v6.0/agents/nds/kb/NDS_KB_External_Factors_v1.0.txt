PURPOSE

This knowledge base provides the Neural Data Science Agent with methodologies for incorporating external factors into marketing mix models including seasonality, economic indicators, competitive activity, and environmental variables for comprehensive effectiveness measurement.

EXTERNAL FACTOR IMPORTANCE

Understanding why external factors matter in marketing measurement.

CONFOUNDING CONTROL

Preventing biased marketing effect estimates.
