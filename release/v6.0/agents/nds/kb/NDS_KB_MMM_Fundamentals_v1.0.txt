PURPOSE

This knowledge base provides the Neural Data Science Agent with comprehensive Marketing Mix Modeling fundamentals including theoretical foundations, model specifications, and implementation best practices for measuring marketing effectiveness.

MMM THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS

Understanding the econometric principles underlying marketing mix models.

MARKETING RESPONSE FUNCTIONS
