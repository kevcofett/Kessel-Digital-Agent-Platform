PURPOSE

This knowledge base provides the Neural Data Science Agent with methodologies for view-through attribution including impression measurement, viewability considerations, attribution window optimization, and best practices for display and video impression credit.

VIEW-THROUGH ATTRIBUTION CONCEPT

Understanding impression-based conversion credit.

VIEW-THROUGH DEFINITION

Credit for impressions without clicks.

Impression exposure
- Ad served to user
- No click interaction
- Subsequent conversion
- Attribution claimed

View-through mechanics
- Cookie or ID matching
- Impression logging
- Conversion tracking
- Lookback window application

Value proposition
- Awareness effect recognition
- Display channel valuation
- Video impression credit
- Full funnel measurement

CLICK VERSUS VIEW COMPARISON

Distinguishing attribution types.

Click-through attribution
- Direct engagement
- Immediate intent signal
- High confidence
- Lower funnel bias

View-through attribution
- Passive exposure
- Awareness influence
- Lower confidence
- Upper funnel recognition

Complementary measurement
- Combined view approach
- Credit prioritization rules
- Incremental contribution
- Holistic evaluation

VIEWABILITY STANDARDS

Ensuring valid impression measurement.

MRC VIEWABILITY STANDARDS

Industry measurement definitions.

Display viewability
- Fifty percent of pixels visible
- One second duration minimum

Video viewability
- Fifty percent of player visible
- Two seconds duration minimum
- Audio considerations
- Completion metrics

Large format standards
- Higher pixel thresholds
- Extended duration requirements
- Premium placement expectations
- Custom definitions

VIEWABILITY MEASUREMENT

ATTRIBUTION WINDOW OPTIMIZATION

Calibrating view-through windows.

WINDOW SELECTION

Determining appropriate lookback.

Industry benchmarks

- Calibrated credit

Multi-window comparison
- Performance by window length
- Diminishing returns analysis
- Cost per attributed conversion
- ROI by window

DYNAMIC WINDOWS

Adaptive window approaches.

Variable by channel
- Channel-specific windows
- Funnel position alignment
- Historical pattern matching
- Performance optimization

Variable by conversion
- Conversion value weighting

- Customer segment variation

CREDIT WEIGHTING

Adjusting view-through credit value.

FRACTIONAL CREDIT

Weighting view-through contribution.

Fixed discount factors
- Percentage of full credit
- Common fifty percent discount
- Channel-specific discounts
- Conservative defaults

Viewability weighting
- Higher viewability higher credit
- Threshold-based tiers
- Continuous weighting
- Quality-adjusted credit

Time decay weighting
- Recency-weighted credit

CLICK-VIEW PRIORITIZATION

Handling mixed attribution paths.

Last click priority
- Click always overrides view
