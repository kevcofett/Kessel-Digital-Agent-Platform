ORC KNOWLEDGE BASE - ROUTING LOGIC AND INTENT CLASSIFICATION

OVERVIEW

This knowledge base provides detailed routing logic for the Orchestrator Agent to classify user intent and route requests to the appropriate specialist agent. Accurate routing ensures users receive expert assistance while maintaining seamless conversation flow.

- User needs anomaly detection or alerting

Keywords: performance, results, metrics, optimization, pacing, variance, post-mortem, analysis, learnings, anomaly, alert, in-flight

CA DOMAIN ROUTING

The Consulting Agent domain encompasses consulting strategy and change management specialists. These agents support strategic consulting engagements from assessment through implementation.

CST AGENT TRIGGERS

- User asks about frameworks or methodology selection
- User needs prioritization help for initiatives or features
- User requests strategic analysis like SWOT or Porter
- User asks about assessment or diagnostic approaches
- User needs business model analysis
- User requests consulting engagement guidance
- User asks about maturity evaluation or benchmarking

Keywords: framework, SWOT, Porter, PESTEL, RICE, MoSCoW, prioritize, prioritization, strategic analysis, assessment, diagnostic, maturity, business model canvas, methodology, consulting

Intent Patterns for CST:
- What framework should I use for...
- Help me prioritize these initiatives...
- Perform a SWOT analysis...
- Assess our digital maturity...
- Which methodology is best for...
- How should I structure this engagement...
- Compare these strategic options...

CHG AGENT TRIGGERS

Route to Change Management Agent when:
- User asks about change management approaches
- User needs stakeholder analysis or mapping
- User requests adoption planning or rollout strategy
- User asks about resistance management
- User needs change readiness assessment
- User requests communication planning for change
- User asks about training approach for transformation

Keywords: change management, stakeholder, adoption, rollout, resistance, readiness, transformation, Kotter, ADKAR, communication plan, training, change network, champion

Intent Patterns for CHG:
- Assess our readiness for this change...
- Map the stakeholders for this initiative...
- Create an adoption plan for...
- How do I manage resistance to...
- What change methodology should I use...
- Help me plan the rollout of...
- Build a communication plan for...

MULTI-AGENT SCENARIOS

Some user requests require coordination across multiple agents. The Orchestrator should recognize these patterns and sequence the routing appropriately.

MPA Multi-Agent Patterns:
- Budget optimization: ANL for projections then CHA for allocation
- Audience strategy: AUD for segments then CHA for targeting tactics
- Campaign planning: Multiple agents then DOC for final document
- Performance review: PRF for analysis then ANL for projections

CA Multi-Agent Patterns:
- Business case: CST for framework then ANL for financials then DOC for document
- Transformation: CST for assessment then CHG for change plan then DOC for roadmap
- Strategy implementation: CST for prioritization then CHG for adoption then DOC for brief

Cross-Domain Patterns:
- Marketing transformation: CST plus CHG plus MPA agents
- Campaign strategy: CST for framework plus MPA for execution planning
- Measurement strategy: CST for approach plus ANL for methodology

ROUTING DECISION LOGIC

Step 1 - Domain Classification
- Media planning, campaigns, advertising - MPA domain
- Consulting, strategy, change - CA domain
- General questions, workflow - Handle as ORC

Step 2 - Agent Selection
- Match keywords and intent patterns
- Consider conversation context
- Default to most specific match

Step 3 - Context Preparation
- Gather relevant session state
- Include prior specialist outputs
- Provide user preferences and constraints

Step 4 - Handoff Execution
- Route with full context
- Present response seamlessly
- Update session state

AMBIGUOUS INTENT HANDLING

When intent is unclear:
- Ask clarifying question if significantly ambiguous
- Default to broader agent if minor ambiguity
- Use conversation history for context clues
- Prefer action over excessive clarification

Common Ambiguities:
- Analysis could mean ANL calculations or CST strategic analysis
- Planning could mean media planning or change planning
- Strategy could mean channel strategy or consulting strategy
- Resolution: Use surrounding context and keywords

FALLBACK BEHAVIOR

When no specialist matches:
- Handle as ORC for general workflow questions
- Provide helpful response from knowledge base
- Offer to clarify what type of help user needs
- Never claim inability to help without attempting
