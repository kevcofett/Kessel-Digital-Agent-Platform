PURPOSE

This knowledge base provides the Performance Agent with comprehensive alert threshold methodology including threshold setting approaches, alert management, and best practices for performance monitoring alerting.

ALERT THRESHOLD FUNDAMENTALS

Understanding performance alerting.

THRESHOLD CONCEPT

What thresholds achieve.

Attention triggering
- Deviation notification
- Issue detection
- Opportunity identification
- Proactive awareness

Action enablement
- Response initiation
- Investigation trigger
- Decision prompt
- Workflow activation

Noise filtering
- Significant focus
- False positive reduction
- Attention efficiency
- Priority management

THRESHOLD TYPES

Categories of alert thresholds.

Absolute thresholds
- Fixed value limits
- Upper or lower bounds
- Specific target
- Clear benchmark

Relative thresholds
- Percentage deviation
- Baseline comparison
- Contextual limits
- Adaptive bounds

Statistical thresholds
- Standard deviation bands
- Percentile limits
- Distribution-based
- Data-driven

THRESHOLD SETTING

Establishing alert boundaries.

FIXED THRESHOLD APPROACH

Static threshold setting.

Business-based thresholds
- Target alignment
- Goal-derived limits
- Strategic priorities
- Stakeholder requirements

Historical-based thresholds
- Past performance reference
- Trend-adjusted levels
- Seasonal consideration
- Experience-based

Benchmark-based thresholds
- Industry standards
- Competitive reference
- Best practice levels
- External anchoring

STATISTICAL THRESHOLD APPROACH

Data-driven threshold setting.

Standard deviation bands
- Mean plus minus sigma
- Two or three sigma
- Normal distribution
- Common approach

Percentile thresholds
- Historical distribution
- Fifth or ninety-fifth
- Robust to outliers
- Non-parametric

Control chart limits
- Process control
- Upper and lower limits
- Centerline
- Run rules

ADAPTIVE THRESHOLD APPROACH

Dynamic threshold adjustment.

Rolling baseline
- Recent history window
- Continuous update
- Trend accommodation
- Seasonality capture

Machine learning thresholds
- Predicted normal range
- Anomaly scoring
- Automatic adjustment
- Pattern learning

Contextual adjustment
- Seasonal factors
- Campaign phase
- Market conditions
- Relevant context

THRESHOLD CALIBRATION

Optimizing threshold settings.

FALSE POSITIVE MANAGEMENT

Reducing unnecessary alerts.

False positive definition
- Alert without issue
- Noise triggered
- Wasted attention
- Alert fatigue cause

Reduction strategies
- Threshold widening
- Confirmation requirements
- Duration criteria
- Context filtering

Trade-off consideration
- Sensitivity balance
- Miss risk
- Attention cost
- Optimal balance

FALSE NEGATIVE MANAGEMENT

Ensuring issue detection.

False negative definition
- Issue without alert
- Missed detection
- Delayed response
- Hidden problem

Reduction strategies
- Threshold narrowing
- Multiple indicators
- Trend alerts
- Pattern recognition

Risk assessment
- Miss consequence
- Detection importance
- Business impact
- Threshold priority

ALERT SEVERITY

Categorizing alert importance.

SEVERITY LEVELS

Alert priority classification.

Informational
- Awareness only
- No immediate action
- Monitoring note
- Context provision

Warning
- Attention needed
- Investigation warranted
- Potential issue
- Moderate urgency

Critical
- Immediate attention
- Action required
- Significant issue
- High urgency

SEVERITY ASSIGNMENT

Determining alert priority.

Magnitude consideration
- Deviation size
- Impact scale
- Threshold distance
- Severity correlation

Business impact
- Revenue effect
- Goal impact
- Strategic importance
- Stakeholder concern

ALERT MANAGEMENT

Handling alerts effectively.

ALERT ROUTING

Directing alerts appropriately.

Recipient determination
- Responsibility alignment
- Expertise matching
- Availability consideration
- Escalation paths

Channel selection
- Email notification
- Dashboard alert
- SMS for urgent
- Slack or Teams integration

Timing consideration
- Immediate for critical
- Batched for informational
- Business hours
- Timezone awareness

ALERT LIFECYCLE

Managing alert states.

Alert states
- Active pending review
- Acknowledged investigating
- Resolved addressed
- Dismissed false positive

Documentation
- Alert history
- Response record
- Resolution notes
- Learning capture

ALERT PERFORMANCE

Evaluating alerting effectiveness.

ALERTING METRICS

Measuring alert quality.

Alert volume
- Total alert count
- Trend tracking
- Capacity assessment
- System health

Alert accuracy
- True positive rate
- False positive rate
- Precision and recall
- Quality indicator

Response metrics
- Acknowledgment time
- Resolution time
- Escalation rate
- Effectiveness measure

CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

Enhancing alerting over time.

Regular review

- Performance evaluation
- Adjustment determination
- Documentation update

Feedback integration
- User feedback
- False positive tracking
- Missed issue review
- Learning incorporation

AGENT APPLICATION GUIDANCE
