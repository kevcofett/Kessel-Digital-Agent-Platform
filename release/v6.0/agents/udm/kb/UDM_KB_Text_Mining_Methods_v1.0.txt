PURPOSE

This knowledge base provides the Unstructured Data Mining Agent with comprehensive text mining methodologies for extracting actionable marketing intelligence from unstructured text sources including ad copy, social media content, customer reviews, and campaign narratives.

TEXT PREPROCESSING PIPELINE

Raw text requires systematic preprocessing before analysis. The pipeline ensures consistent quality across all text sources.

TOKENIZATION

Tokenization breaks text into meaningful units for analysis.

Word tokenization methods
- Whitespace splitting for basic segmentation
- Punctuation-aware tokenization for preserving contractions
- Subword tokenization using BPE or WordPiece for handling unknown words
- Sentence tokenization for document-level analysis

Marketing-specific tokenization considerations
- Preserve hashtags as single tokens
- Handle at-mentions as named entities
- Maintain URL structures for link analysis
- Recognize emoji sequences as semantic units

NORMALIZATION

Text normalization standardizes variations for consistent analysis.

Case normalization
- Lowercase conversion for general matching
- Preserve case for named entity recognition
- Mixed approach for sentiment analysis where caps indicate emphasis

Unicode normalization
- NFKC normalization for character consistency
- Accent handling based on target language
- Special character mapping to ASCII equivalents

Abbreviation expansion
- Marketing acronym expansion using domain dictionary
- Social media abbreviation handling
- Platform-specific shorthand resolution

STOPWORD REMOVAL

Strategic stopword handling balances noise reduction with semantic preservation.

Standard stopwords
- Language-specific function words
- High-frequency low-information terms
- Numeric placeholders in controlled contexts

Domain-specific stopword considerations
- Retain brand names regardless of frequency
- Preserve action verbs critical to CTA analysis
- Keep temporal references for campaign timing
- Maintain platform names for channel attribution

STEMMING AND LEMMATIZATION

Root form extraction improves matching and reduces vocabulary size.

Stemming approaches
- Porter stemmer for English text
- Snowball stemmer for multilingual support
- Aggressive versus light stemming tradeoffs

Lemmatization considerations
- Part-of-speech aware lemmatization
- Preserve marketing terminology intact
- Handle brand-specific neologisms
- Maintain campaign-specific coined terms
