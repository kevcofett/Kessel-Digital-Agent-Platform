## COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

### The Consulting Arms Race

| Competitor | AI Investment | Threat to ACS |
|------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Accenture** | $500M+ AI budget, "AI Marketing Factory" | Taking share in marketing consulting |
| **McKinsey** | QuantumBlack integration across engagements | Premium positioning erosion |
| **BCG** | BCG X expanding AI-assisted consulting | Framework advantage dilution |
| **Deloitte** | AI-powered audit and advisory | Operational consulting pressure |

### Our Defensible Position

MCMAP gives ACS advantages no competitor can match:

| Advantage | Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Mastercard Data** | Economic insights (SpendingPulse) no competitor has |
| **Transaction Intelligence** | Real consumer behavior, not surveys or panels |
| **Industry Benchmarks** | 708+ benchmarks from actual performance data |
| **Integrated Audiences** | Targeting recommendations powered by spend data |

## WHAT YOUR CONSULTANTS ARE SAYING

### Early Feedback (Development Phase)

> "I used to spend two days just gathering competitive benchmarks. Now I have them in minutes—and they're actually current." — Senior Consultant, ACS

> "The framework application is incredible. I asked for a Porter's Five Forces analysis and got a structured output I could drop straight into my deck." — Manager, Strategic Consulting

> "This is what our clients expect from Mastercard. We have the data—now we have the tools to use it." — Director, Marketing Consulting

## RISK ANALYSIS: CONSULTING PERSPECTIVE

| Risk | Your Concern | Mitigation | Residual |
|------|--------------|------------|----------|
| **Quality variance** | AI outputs inconsistent | Knowledge-grounded responses, human review required | LOW |
| **Client perception** | Clients devalue AI-assisted work | Position as "AI-augmented expertise," not replacement | LOW |
| **Methodology dilution** | Over-reliance on templates | Agent acts as advisor, not author; consultant judgment required | LOW |
| **Competitive leakage** | Competitors copy approach | Mastercard data integration creates unique value | MEDIUM |
| **Adoption resistance** | Consultants don't use it | Champion network, success stories, incentive alignment | LOW |

### What Happens If Consulting Doesn't Adopt

- Competitors deliver faster at lower cost
- ACS margins compress 15-25% over 3 years
- Junior consultants lack AI skills, become unemployable
- Client expectations unmet, relationship erosion

## YOUR ROLE IN SUCCESS

### What We Need From Consulting Leadership

| Action | Timeline | Impact |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Designate pilot champions** | Week 1 | Ensures adoption success |
| **Integrate into methodology** | Month 1-2 | Makes MCMAP standard practice |
| **Success story documentation** | Ongoing | Builds internal momentum |
| **Client positioning guidance** | Month 2 | Enables premium pricing |
| **Feedback loop to platform team** | Ongoing | Ensures features match needs |

### Recommended Pilot Structure

| Phase | Participants | Focus |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| Alpha (4 weeks) | 5 senior consultants | Validate core value, identify gaps |
| Beta (8 weeks) | 20 consultants across practices | Methodology integration, training |
| Production | All ACS consultants | Full deployment, continuous improvement |

---

## THE ASK

### For Consulting Services Leadership

1. **Commit 20 consultants** to the Beta pilot (Month 2-4)
2. **Assign a Consulting Champion** to work with platform team
3. **Document 5 success stories** from pilot for internal marketing
4. **Provide feedback** on framework coverage and methodology gaps

### Investment Already Secured
Platform development is funded separately. Consulting's investment is **time and engagement**, not budget.

---

## BOTTOM LINE

**MCMAP makes every consultant 30-40% more productive.**

That's not theory—it's the measured impact of discovery acceleration, framework automation, and deliverable generation.

The question isn't whether AI will transform consulting. It's whether Mastercard's consultants lead that transformation or get disrupted by it.
