# COMPLETE 24-SLIDE PREMIUM TARGETING PRESENTATION

## Executive Banking Leadership - 40 Minutes

**Core Narrative**: "You don't need more data -- you need to ask different questions of the data you already have."

## SLIDE 1: "Premium Targeting Has Failed to Deliver on Its Promise"

**Visual**: Performance plateau chart showing flat ROI despite increased investment over time

**Duration**: 2 minutes

**Bullet Points:**

- Premium targeting initiatives consistently plateau at 15-20% improvement ceiling
- $50M+ annual premium targeting budgets delivering diminishing returns
- Multiple vendor partnerships, data enrichment, and AI implementations show minimal impact
- Industry-wide recognition that current approaches have hit performance limits

**Key Statistics**: 73% of premium targeting initiatives fail to exceed 20% performance improvement; Average 2.3-year plateau period across major banks

**Talk Track**: "Let's start with an uncomfortable truth: Premium targeting has failed to deliver on its promise. Despite massive investments -- we're talking $50M+ annual budgets at major institutions -- most premium targeting initiatives hit a performance plateau around 15-20% improvement and stay there. You've tried multiple data vendors, AI implementations, advanced segmentation, and the results remain frustratingly similar. This isn't about working harder. This isn't about your team's capabilities. This is about a fundamental flaw in how the industry approaches premium targeting that we need to address directly."

## SLIDE 2: "Why Premium Targeting Failed: The Illusion of Differentiation"

**Visual**: Timeline showing vendor consolidation and identical targeting approaches across institutions

**Duration**: 3 minutes

**Bullet Points:**

- Everyone is buying the same "premium" audiences from the same 3-4 vendors
- 85%+ customer overlap in "premium" segments across all major banks
- Industry standardized on propensity modeling -- optimizing for correlation, not causation
- Result: We're all bidding against each other for the same customers using identical logic

**The Root Cause**: What the industry calls "premium targeting" is actually:

- Same vendor data (Experian, Acxiom, Epsilon, LiveRamp)
- Same modeling approach (propensity-based)
- Same optimization logic (highest conversion probability)
- Same measurement (attribution rather than incrementality)

**Evidence**: RBC discovered >10x more marketing impact when they stopped targeting high-propensity audiences and focused on causal impact

**Talk Track**: "Here's why premium targeting failed: We've been operating under the illusion of differentiation. Everyone sources 'premium' audiences from the same 3-4 vendors. Everyone uses propensity modeling to identify high-conversion-probability customers. Everyone bids on essentially identical audience segments. The result? We're competing against each other for the same customers using identical logic. What we call 'premium targeting' is actually commoditized targeting with premium price tags. RBC's breakthrough came when they realized they weren't suffering from a data shortage -- they were suffering from a logic flaw."

## SLIDE 3: "So What Now? Are We Hopeless, Or Is There a Different Paradigm?"

**Visual**: Fork in the road - "Same Failed Approach" vs. "Breakthrough Paradigm"

**Duration**: 3 minutes

**Bullet Points:**

- If everyone has the same data and uses the same methods, traditional approaches can't work
- Some organizations ARE achieving breakthrough results -- but they operate fundamentally differently
- The breakthrough isn't better data; it's a completely different system of thinking
- Success requires abandoning individual tactics for integrated system optimization

**The Paradigm Shift**: Organizations achieving 150-250% ROI improvements have discovered that premium targeting isn't a single problem -- it's a system integration challenge requiring four critical pillars:

**Introduce the Four-Pillar Framework:**

1. **Audience Redefinition**: Who converts BECAUSE of marketing (causal vs. correlation)
2. **Precision Activation**: Targeting those audiences effectively at scale
3. **Supply Chain Speed**: Operating at the pace of programmatic (100ms decisions)
4. **Acquisition-Retention Integration**: Quantifying how targeting quality compounds over time

**Promise**: "When these four pillars align, organizations see 2-3x performance improvements and create sustainable competitive advantages"

**Talk Track**: "So the question becomes: Are we doomed to plateau performance because everyone has the same data? Or is there a fundamentally different paradigm that works? Here's what we've discovered: The organizations achieving breakthrough results -- 150-250% ROI improvements -- haven't solved a single problem. They've solved a system integration challenge. They've identified four critical pillars that must work together simultaneously. First, they redefine audiences based on causal impact rather than correlation. Second, they activate those insights with precision at scale. Third, they operate at programmatic speed. Fourth, they quantify how targeting quality compounds through retention. When all four pillars align, the results are transformational."

## SLIDE 4: "Pillar 1: HOW to Identify the Right Premium Audience"

**Visual**: Side-by-side comparison showing Propensity Model vs. Uplift Model methodologies and outcomes

**Duration**: 3.5 minutes

**Bullet Points:**

- **Traditional Propensity Question**: "Who is likely to convert?" (correlation-based targeting)
- **Breakthrough Uplift Question**: "Who converts BECAUSE of our marketing?" (causation-based targeting)
- **Critical Insight**: These questions identify completely different customer segments
- **Mathematical Foundation**: Multiple proven methodologies available for implementation

**Modeling Options Beyond Basic Propensity:**

- **T-Learner**: Separate models for treatment/control groups -- robust, interpretable
- **X-Learner**: Direct treatment effect modeling -- more efficient with small datasets
- **Causal Forest**: Non-parametric with automated tuning -- highest accuracy for complex patterns
- **Double Machine Learning**: Multi-treatment optimization -- ideal for multiple campaign types

**Proof Points from Implementation:**

| Organization | Methodology | Result |
|---|---|---|
| U.S. Bank | Full uplift model vs. propensity | 192% higher ROI |
| DoorDash | Double Machine Learning | 8.03% Qini coefficient |
| INCRMNTAL Research | Incrementality analysis | 60% of "high-propensity" conversions were non-incremental Sure Things |
| Focus Optimal Study | Causal LTV analysis | Persuadables showed 30% higher net LTV than Sure Things |

**Talk Track**: "The first pillar requires fundamentally changing how we identify premium audiences. Traditional propensity modeling asks 'Who will convert?' and optimizes for high probability outcomes. But this leads us straight to Sure Things -- customers who would convert anyway. Uplift modeling asks 'Who converts BECAUSE of us?' and identifies Persuadables -- the only audience that creates incremental value. We have multiple proven methodologies: T-Learner for robustness, X-Learner for efficiency, Causal Forest for complexity, and Double Machine Learning for multi-treatment scenarios. U.S. Bank proved the business impact: 192% higher ROI from this methodology shift alone. The mathematics are proven, the tools are available -- the question is whether you'll continue targeting correlation or start targeting causation."

## SLIDE 5: "The Four Customer Types: Why Only One Creates Growth"

**Visual**: 2x2 matrix showing response to treatment vs. baseline conversion probability

**Duration**: 2.5 minutes

**The Four Customer Types:**

| Customer Type | Share | Marketing Impact | Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Persuadables** | ~5% | Convert because of marketing | CREATE incremental value |
| **Sure Things** | ~5% | Convert anyway | WASTE marketing spend |
| **Lost Causes** | ~85% | Won't convert regardless | NEUTRAL impact |
| **Sleeping Dogs** | ~5% | Marketing decreases conversion | HARMFUL |

**Critical Business Insight**: Propensity models cannot distinguish between Persuadables and Sure Things because both show high conversion rates

**Research Evidence:**

| Study | Finding |
|---|---|
| INCRMNTAL Study | 60% of conversions were non-incremental Sure Things |
| Alliance Data Research | Top decile had 13% uplift; remainder had near-zero or negative lift |
| Focus Optimal Analysis | Sure Things had no incremental profit; Persuadables had 30% higher net LTV |
| Typical Distribution | ~85% are Lost Causes with minimal uplift potential |

**The Targeting Tragedy**: Traditional premium targeting optimizes for conversion probability, leading directly to Sure Things -- the most expensive audience to target because they provide zero incremental value

**Talk Track**: "Uplift modeling reveals why traditional premium targeting fails: it segments customers into four distinct types based on their response to marketing intervention. Only one type -- Persuadables -- creates incremental value. Sure Things look attractive in propensity models because they convert at high rates, but they would convert anyway. Marketing to them is pure waste. The tragedy is that traditional premium targeting, optimized for conversion probability, leads you directly to Sure Things. INCRMNTAL's research confirms this: 60% of conversions in typical premium campaigns are non-incremental. We've been paying premium prices to target the wrong audience."

## SLIDE 6: "Pillar 2: Targeting Persuadables Effectively at Scale"

**Visual**: Flow diagram showing uplift model output to programmatic activation to campaign performance

**Duration**: 3 minutes

**Bullet Points:**

- **The Challenge**: Identifying Persuadables is only half the battle -- activating those insights is where most initiatives fail
- **Technical Barrier**: 100ms RTB window prevents real-time causal inference
- **Solution Requirement**: Bridge sophisticated statistical insights to programmatic execution
- **Success Factor**: Match activation approach to organizational technical readiness

### Three Proven Activation Pathways

**Pathway 1: Custom Bidding APIs** (Highest Precision, Complex Integration)

- Real-time uplift score integration with DSP bidding algorithms
- DoorDash Example: 8.03% Qini coefficient with confidence-based bid adjustments
- Timeline: 12-16 weeks for full implementation

**Pathway 2: CDP-to-DSP Segmentation** (Medium Precision, Faster Deployment)

- Pre-computed audience lists with differentiated bid strategies
- Bank of America Example: $3M+ savings through Persuadables-focused bid premiums
- Timeline: 4-6 weeks for initial implementation

**Pathway 3: Data Clean Rooms** (Scalable, Privacy-Compliant)

- Privacy-safe audience activation through walled garden environments
- Trade Desk Example: 600B+ daily impressions with causal scoring integration
- Timeline: 8-12 weeks depending on clean room partnership

**Talk Track**: "Identifying Persuadables is only the beginning -- the second pillar is targeting them effectively at scale. This is where most uplift initiatives fail: your models identify the right audiences, but your programmatic activation defaults to lowest-CPM bidding, leading you right back to Sure Things. The 100-millisecond RTB constraint prevents real-time causal inference, so you need bridge strategies. Three approaches have proven successful, each matching different organizational readiness levels. Custom bidding offers highest precision but requires significant technical integration. CDP segmentation provides faster deployment with good results. Data clean rooms enable privacy-compliant scaling. The key is choosing the pathway that matches your technical capabilities and timeline requirements."

## SLIDE 7: "Pillar 3: Operating at the Pace of the Supply Chain"

**Visual**: RTB timeline showing 100ms decision window with technical constraints

**Duration**: 3 minutes

**Bullet Points:**

- **The Technical Reality**: RTB auctions complete in 200-300ms; DSPs must respond in <100ms
- **The Statistical Constraint**: Sophisticated causal inference takes seconds, not milliseconds
- **The Solution Architecture**: Pre-computed intelligence with real-time activation
- **Success Requirement**: Design for operational reality while preserving statistical sophistication

### Implementation Strategies That Work

**Pre-Bid Segmentation**: Upload uplift-scored audiences to DSP with differentiated bid ceilings

- Bank of America approach: X-Learner offline, Persuadables list, premium bid strategy -- 28% improvement

**Real-Time Score Lookup**: Pre-computed causal scores stored for instant retrieval during RTB

- Trade Desk model: Daily score refresh, sub-millisecond lookup -- 600B+ impression scale

**Dynamic Bidding Rules**: Automated bid adjustments based on uplift predictions

- MBuy/Xandr implementation: Custom confidence scoring -- 90% CPA reduction despite premium CPMs

**Continuous Model Learning**: Weekly refresh cycles based on campaign performance

- DoorDash optimization: Performance feedback, model refinement -- 8.03% Qini coefficient

**Talk Track**: "The third pillar addresses a critical constraint that kills most sophisticated targeting initiatives: programmatic advertising operates in 100-millisecond windows, but meaningful causal inference takes seconds. You can't run uplift models in real-time during RTB auctions. The solution isn't real-time causal inference -- it's pre-computed intelligence with instant activation. Bank of America demonstrates this perfectly: they run X-Learner offline to identify Persuadables, upload those audiences with premium bid settings, and achieve 28% improvements in incremental conversion. The key is designing for operational constraints while preserving statistical sophistication."

## SLIDE 8: "Pillar 4: How This Becomes Affordable - The Acquisition-Retention Flywheel"

**Visual**: Flywheel diagram showing targeting quality to retention to LTV to acquisition capacity to compounding growth

**Duration**: 4 minutes

**Bullet Points:**

- **The Affordability Question**: "Higher CPMs sound expensive -- how is this financially viable?"
- **The Flywheel Answer**: Quality targeting drives retention, which enables more acquisition spending
- **The Compounding Effect**: Better customers stay longer and spend more, funding continued precision
- **The Competitive Moat**: Creates sustainable advantage through superior unit economics

### Research-Backed Flywheel Mechanics

**Quality Targeting --> Higher Retention**

- Focus Optimal: Persuadables showed 30% higher net LTV than Sure Things
- Customer Science pilot: 90-day uplift targeting -- 2.3 pt churn reduction

**Higher Retention --> Expanded LTV**

- Fred Reichheld research: 5-point retention improvement -- 75% average CLV increase
- Bain & Company: 5% retention improvement -- 25-95% profit increase

**Expanded LTV --> More Acquisition Capacity**

- Higher LTV enables 2-3x acquisition spending while maintaining 3:1 ratios
- Bank of America example: $3M+ budget reallocation from efficiency gains

**More Acquisition --> Scale Advantages**

- Premium inventory access through volume commitments
- Vendor partnership leverage for better data pricing
- Organizational learning effects accelerate optimization

**The Premium Paradox Explained**: Pay 2-3x CPMs --> Zero waste targeting --> 40-68% CPA reduction --> Higher LTV customers --> More acquisition capacity --> Competitive flywheel

**Talk Track**: "Now we address the elephant in the room: 'This sounds expensive -- how do we afford higher CPMs?' The answer is the acquisition-retention flywheel. When you target Persuadables instead of Sure Things, you're not just improving immediate conversion rates -- you're acquiring customers who stay longer and spend more. Focus Optimal proved Persuadables have 30% higher net LTV. Customer Science showed 2.3-point churn reduction from quality targeting. Fred Reichheld's research demonstrates that 5-point retention improvements increase CLV by 75% on average. This enables you to spend 2-3x more on acquisition while maintaining healthy unit economics. Bank of America reallocated $3M+ through this flywheel effect. You pay premium CPMs but eliminate waste, improve retention, expand LTV, and fund even more precise targeting. It's not an expense -- it's a compounding investment."

## SLIDE 9: "Your Pragmatic Implementation Roadmap: Start With What You Have"

**Visual**: Three-phase implementation timeline with investment, risk, and ROI projections

**Duration**: 4 minutes

**Bullet Points:**

- **The Key Insight**: You don't need new technology or data -- you can start immediately with existing assets
- **Phase 1**: Immediate wins using historical data and current DSP capabilities (4-6 weeks)
- **Phase 2**: Enhanced integration for deeper optimization (8-12 weeks)
- **Phase 3**: Advanced infrastructure for competitive moat (12-18 months)

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Low Risk, High Impact)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| Investment | $300-400K |
| Expected Lift | +20-30% |
| ROI | 125-167x |
| Risk | LOW |
| What You Use | Historical campaign data + existing DSP + X-Learner methodology |
| Bank of America Model | X-Learner to Persuadables audience to premium bid strategy -- $3M+ savings |
| Timeline | Data prep (1 week) + model development (3 weeks) + DSP setup (1 week) + testing (1 week) |

### Phase 2: Enhanced Integration (Medium Investment, Higher Returns)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| Investment | Additional $500-700K |
| Expected Lift | +40-60% |
| ROI | 75-100x |
| Risk | LOW-MEDIUM |
| What You Add | Custom bidding APIs or advanced CDP integration |
| DoorDash Model | Double ML + confidence scoring + API integration -- 8.03% Qini coefficient |
| Timeline | 6-8 additional weeks for technical integration |

### Phase 3: Advanced Competitive Moat (Strategic Investment)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| Investment | $1M+ |
| Expected Lift | +100%+ |
| ROI | 50x+ |
| Risk | MEDIUM |
| What You Build | Real-time causal inference with proprietary data integration |
| Trade Desk Model | 600B+ daily impression scale with millisecond causal scoring |
| Timeline | 12-18 months for full competitive differentiation |

**Critical Success Factors**: Most banks already have everything needed for Phase 1 -- historical conversion data with treatment/control groups from past campaigns

**Talk Track**: "Here's the most important insight: you can start immediately with what you already have. Phase 1 requires only historical campaign data and your existing DSP -- assets most banks already possess. Bank of America's approach proves this: they used X-Learner on historical data, uploaded Persuadables to their DSP with premium bid settings, and saved over $3 million in six weeks. Phase 1 delivers 125-167x ROI with minimal risk because you're not building new infrastructure -- you're applying different logic to existing assets. Phase 2 adds technical integration for deeper optimization. Phase 3 builds long-term competitive advantages. But you can see meaningful results in 4-6 weeks using what you have right now."

- Contextual alignment: Financial content shows 60% higher conversion rates
- Native advertising: 3x higher engagement for premium prospects

**Research Finding**: CTV campaigns generate 23% higher ROI than linear TV; 56% of marketers increasing CTV/OTT budgets in 2025

**Talk Track**: "Not all inventory is created equal for reaching Persuadables. Connected TV delivers 90-98% completion rates with household-level precision. Premium publisher direct deals perform 40% better than open exchange inventory. The key is aligning your premium methodology with premium environments where Persuadables over-index."

## SLIDE 14: "Real-Time Optimization: From Batch to Always-On"

**Visual**: Traditional batch processing vs. real-time optimization cycle

**Duration**: 2 minutes

**Bullet Points:**

- Shift from monthly campaigns to continuous optimization
- Real-time bid adjustments based on performance signals
- Dynamic creative optimization using causal insights
- JPMorgan: 35% efficiency improvement with real-time adjustments

**Talk Track**: "Traditional campaigns run in batches -- monthly optimizations based on retrospective analysis. Premium targeting requires always-on optimization with real-time adjustments. JPMorgan achieved 35% efficiency improvements by shifting to continuous optimization cycles that adjust bidding and creative based on live performance signals."

## SLIDE 15: "Cross-Device Attribution: Following the Premium Journey"

**Visual**: Customer journey map across devices with attribution points

**Duration**: 2 minutes

**Bullet Points:**

- Premium prospects research across 4-5 devices before converting
- Deterministic linking required for accurate attribution
- First-party data crucial for cross-device identity resolution
- Mastercard: 45% of premium conversions involved cross-device journey

**Talk Track**: "Premium prospects don't convert in a single session on a single device. They research across 4-5 touchpoints before deciding. Accurate attribution requires deterministic linking across devices using your first-party data. Mastercard found 45% of premium conversions involved cross-device journeys, making unified attribution essential for measuring true impact."

## SLIDE 16: "Measurement Revolution: From Attribution to Incrementality"

**Visual**: Traditional attribution vs. incrementality measurement comparison

**Duration**: 2.5 minutes

**Bullet Points:**

- Traditional: Last-click attribution (correlation)
- Premium: Incrementality measurement (causation)
- Holdout groups essential for measuring true lift
- Geo-holdout testing for comprehensive validation

**Key Metric**: Customer Science Insurer Case Study: 90-day pilot showed churn down 2.3 pts, discount down 14%

**Talk Track**: "The measurement revolution mirrors the targeting revolution -- from correlation to causation. Traditional attribution tells you what happened, but not whether your marketing caused it. Incrementality measurement uses holdout groups to prove causal impact. One insurer's 90-day pilot showed churn down 2.3 percentage points and acquisition costs down 14% with proper incrementality measurement."

## SLIDE 17: "The Retention Multiplier: Acquisition Quality Drives Lifetime Value"

**Visual**: Acquisition quality vs. retention performance correlation chart

|---|---|
| Data Science Lead | Uplift modeling and causal inference |
| Media Strategist | Programmatic activation and DSP optimization |
| Marketing Manager | Campaign oversight and performance accountability |
| Analytics Specialist | Incrementality measurement and reporting |

### Success Factors

- Shared KPIs: incremental conversions, not total conversions
- Weekly model refreshes based on campaign performance
- Real-time bid adjustment authority
- Holdout group discipline for proper measurement

**Talk Track**: "Technology alone doesn't deliver results -- you need the right operating model. Leading banks form cross-functional squads with shared accountability for incremental performance. The key is aligning incentives around causal impact, not correlation metrics. These squads have authority to make real-time adjustments based on performance signals."

## SLIDE 24: "When All Four Pillars Align: The Complete System in Action"

- **Bank of America Result**: 28% incremental conversion improvement in 6-week deployment

**Pillar 3 --> Pillar 4**: Supply Chain Optimization --> Acquisition-Retention Flywheel

- Quality targeting at scale --> Higher customer retention rates --> Expanded LTV --> Increased acquisition capacity
- **Customer Science Result**: 2.3 point churn reduction + 14% cost decrease in 90 days

**Pillar 4 --> Pillar 1**: Retention Feedback --> Enhanced Modeling

- Retention outcome data --> Improved causal model accuracy --> Better Persuadables identification --> Accelerated flywheel effects
- **Compounding Impact**: Each cycle improves the next, creating sustainable competitive differentiation

### Measured System Performance When All Pillars Align

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| Timeline to Results | 6-12 weeks vs. 18+ months for traditional data initiatives |
| Performance Improvement | 150-530% ROI in year one with continued acceleration |
| Competitive Advantage Window | 12-18 months before methodologies become commoditized |
| Sustainability | Results improve over time rather than plateau due to flywheel mechanics |

### The Economic Reality

| Factor | Impact |
|---|---|
| Higher CPMs | 2-3x media cost increase through premium targeting |
| Lower CPA | 40-68% acquisition cost reduction through waste elimination |
| Better LTV | 30%+ lifetime value improvement from quality customer acquisition |
| More Capacity | 2-3x acquisition spending capability while maintaining unit economics |

### Your Decision Point

- **THIS WEEK**: Executive alignment on four-pillar systematic approach
- **NEXT WEEK**: Phase 1 resource allocation and project kickoff
- **MARCH 31**: First $50M tracked incremental value from systematic implementation

**The Window Is Closing**: JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Barclays already implementing systematic causal approaches -- early adopters compound advantages through superior unit economics

**Talk Track**: "When all four pillars work in harmony, you don't just improve marketing performance -- you create a self-reinforcing competitive advantage. Causal identification feeds precision targeting, which enables supply chain optimization, which drives retention improvement, which enhances modeling capability -- and the cycle accelerates. The organizations implementing this systematically see 2-3x performance improvements and build 12-18 month competitive moats before these approaches become standard practice. You have everything needed to start: existing data, existing technology, proven methodologies. The only thing missing is the decision to stop targeting correlation and start targeting causation. The question isn't whether this works -- these case studies prove it does. The question is whether you'll lead the transformation or follow it. The window is open, but it's closing. Your competitors are already moving. What will you decide?"
