SECTION 1 - CORE FINANCIAL FORMULAS
================================================================================

RETURN ON AD SPEND (ROAS)

CORRECT FORMULA
ROAS = (Revenue - Spend) / Spend

FORMULA COMPONENTS
- Revenue: Total revenue attributed to advertising
- Spend: Total advertising expenditure
- Result: Expressed as decimal or percentage

INTERPRETATION
- ROAS of 1.0 (100%) means break-even after ad costs
- ROAS of 0.5 (50%) means 50% profit margin on ad spend
- ROAS of 2.0 (200%) means doubling money invested

IMPORTANT NOTE
Many platforms display revenue/spend ratio as ROAS. This is incorrect for calculating actual return. When using platform-reported ROAS, convert using:
Correct_ROAS = Platform_ROAS - 1

EXAMPLE CALCULATIONS
- Spend $1,000, Revenue $3,000
- Platform displays: 3.0x ROAS (revenue/spend)
- Correct ROAS: ($3,000 - $1,000) / $1,000 = 2.0 (200% return)

COST PER ACQUISITION (CPA)

FORMULA
CPA = Total_Spend / Number_of_Conversions

COMPONENTS
- Total Spend: All media costs including fees
- Conversions: Completed desired actions

VARIATIONS BY GOAL
- Cost Per Lead (CPL): Spend / Leads
- Cost Per Sale (CPS): Spend / Sales
- Cost Per Install (CPI): Spend / App Installs

COST PER MILLE (CPM)

FORMULA
CPM = (Total_Spend / Impressions) x 1000

PURPOSE
Standard metric for comparing media costs across channels and formats on a per-thousand-impression basis.

EFFECTIVE CPM (eCPM)

FORMULA
eCPM = (Total_Spend / Impressions) x 1000

PURPOSE
Normalizes costs across different buying methods (CPC, CPM, CPA) to comparable CPM.

================================================================================
SECTION 2 - ENGAGEMENT METRICS
================================================================================

CLICK-THROUGH RATE (CTR)

FORMULA
CTR = (Clicks / Impressions) x 100

BENCHMARKS BY CHANNEL

- Display: 0.05-0.15%
- Social Feed: 0.5-1.5%
- Video Pre-Roll: 0.5-2%
- Native: 0.2-0.5%

CONVERSION RATE (CVR)

FORMULA
CVR = (Conversions / Clicks) x 100

VARIATIONS
- Site Conversion Rate: Conversions / Site Visitors
- Landing Page CVR: Conversions / Landing Page Visitors
- Funnel Step CVR: Step Completions / Step Entries

ENGAGEMENT RATE

FORMULA
Engagement_Rate = (Total_Engagements / Impressions) x 100

COMPONENTS INCLUDED
- Likes, reactions
- Comments
- Shares

================================================================================
SECTION 3 - REACH AND FREQUENCY
================================================================================

REACH

DEFINITION
Number of unique individuals exposed to advertising at least once during campaign period.

REACH PERCENTAGE
Reach_Pct = (Unique_Reach / Target_Population) x 100

FREQUENCY

FORMULA
Average_Frequency = Total_Impressions / Unique_Reach

EFFECTIVE FREQUENCY
Minimum exposures needed for message impact. Varies by:
- Campaign objective (awareness vs conversion)
- Creative complexity
- Category involvement
- Competitive noise

TYPICAL EFFECTIVE FREQUENCY RANGES
- Simple awareness: 1-3 exposures
- Brand consideration: 3-5 exposures
- Purchase intent: 5-8 exposures
- Complex messaging: 8-12 exposures

GROSS RATING POINTS (GRP)

FORMULA
GRP = Reach_Pct x Average_Frequency

EXAMPLE
- 60% reach with 4.0 frequency = 240 GRPs

TARGET RATING POINTS (TRP)

FORMULA
TRP = Target_Reach_Pct x Target_Frequency

DIFFERENCE FROM GRP
TRP measures delivery against specific target audience, not total population.

================================================================================
SECTION 4 - EFFICIENCY METRICS
================================================================================

COST PER CLICK (CPC)

FORMULA
CPC = Total_Spend / Total_Clicks

AVERAGE VS ACTUAL
- Platform CPC: Average across all clicks
- True CPC: Actual cost per individual click varies by auction

COST PER VIEW (CPV)

FORMULA
CPV = Total_Spend / Completed_Views

VIEWABLE CPM (vCPM)

FORMULA
vCPM = (Total_Spend / Viewable_Impressions) x 1000

VIEWABILITY STANDARD
- Display: 50% of pixels visible for 1 second
- Video: 50% of pixels visible for 2 continuous seconds

COST PER ENGAGEMENT (CPE)

FORMULA
CPE = Total_Spend / Total_Engagements

COST PER COMPLETED VIEW (CPCV)

FORMULA
CPCV = Total_Spend / Completed_Video_Views

================================================================================
SECTION 5 - ATTRIBUTION AND INCREMENTALITY
================================================================================

ATTRIBUTION WINDOW METRICS

CLICK-THROUGH CONVERSIONS
Conversions occurring within X days after ad click.

VIEW-THROUGH CONVERSIONS
Conversions occurring within X days after ad impression without click.

STANDARD WINDOWS
- Click-through: 30 days (some platforms 7-90 days)
- View-through: 1 day (some platforms up to 7 days)

INCREMENTALITY CALCULATIONS

INCREMENTAL LIFT

FORMULA
Lift_Pct = ((Test_CVR - Control_CVR) / Control_CVR) x 100

COMPONENTS
- Test Group: Exposed to advertising
- Control Group: Holdout group not exposed

INCREMENTAL CONVERSIONS

FORMULA
Incremental_Conversions = Total_Conversions x (1 - (1 / (1 + Lift_Pct/100)))

INCREMENTAL ROAS

FORMULA
iROAS = (Incremental_Revenue - Spend) / Spend

NOTE
Incremental ROAS typically lower than attributed ROAS due to baseline conversion removal.

================================================================================
SECTION 6 - BUDGET AND PACING
================================================================================

DAILY BUDGET FROM MONTHLY

FORMULA
Daily_Budget = Monthly_Budget / Days_in_Month

MONTHLY FROM DAILY (GOOGLE METHOD)
Monthly_Cap = Daily_Budget x 30.4

PACING CALCULATIONS

SPEND PACING

FORMULA
Pacing_Pct = (Actual_Spend / Expected_Spend) x 100

EXPECTED SPEND (LINEAR)
Expected_Spend = Total_Budget x (Days_Elapsed / Total_Days)

PACING STATUS
- Under 90%: Underpacing (may not deliver full budget)
- 90-110%: On pace
- Over 110%: Overpacing (may exhaust budget early)

DELIVERY PACING

FORMULA
Delivery_Pct = (Actual_Impressions / Expected_Impressions) x 100

BUDGET ALLOCATION

SHARE OF VOICE (SOV)

FORMULA
SOV = (Brand_Impressions / Category_Impressions) x 100

SHARE OF SPEND

FORMULA
Share_of_Spend = (Brand_Spend / Category_Spend) x 100

EXCESS SHARE OF VOICE (ESOV)

FORMULA
ESOV = SOV - Market_Share

INTERPRETATION
Positive ESOV correlated with market share growth over time.

================================================================================
SECTION 7 - MEDIA MIX MODELING
================================================================================

CONTRIBUTION CALCULATION

FORMULA
Channel_Contribution = Channel_Attributed_Revenue / Total_Revenue

MARGINAL ROAS

FORMULA
mROAS = Change_in_Revenue / Change_in_Spend

PURPOSE
Measures incremental return of next dollar spent. More accurate for optimization than average ROAS.

SATURATION CURVE FORMULA

HILL FUNCTION
Response = Saturation_Level x (Spend^Power / (Half_Saturation^Power + Spend^Power))

COMPONENTS
- Saturation Level: Maximum achievable response
- Half Saturation: Spend level achieving 50% of max
- Power: Curve steepness

- SIVT: Sophisticated Invalid Traffic (fraud)

TARGET
Total IVT should be below 3% for quality inventory.

AD FRAUD RATE

FORMULA
Fraud_Rate = (Fraudulent_Impressions / Total_Impressions) x 100

================================================================================
SECTION 9 - CROSS-CHANNEL FORMULAS
================================================================================

BLENDED CPA

FORMULA
Blended_CPA = Total_Cross_Channel_Spend / Total_Conversions

BLENDED ROAS

FORMULA
Blended_ROAS = (Total_Revenue - Total_Spend) / Total_Spend

CHANNEL MIX EFFICIENCY

FORMULA
Mix_Efficiency = Weighted_Channel_ROAS / Blended_ROAS

INTERPRETATION
