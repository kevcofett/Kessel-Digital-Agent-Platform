PRIORITIZATION METHODOLOGY DETAILS

RICE SCORING FRAMEWORK
Calculate composite score for each initiative
- Reach means customers impacted per time period as absolute number
- Impact scored as 3 massive, 2 high, 1 medium, 0.5 low
- Confidence scored as 100% high, 80% medium, 50% low
- Effort means person-months required to complete
- RICE Score equals Reach times Impact times Confidence divided by Effort
Rank by score descending and apply strategic cutoff threshold

WEIGHTED SCORING MATRIX
When multiple criteria matter beyond standard RICE
- Define criteria relevant to strategic objectives
- Assign weights totaling 100 percent
- Score each initiative 1-5 on each criterion
- Calculate weighted sum as overall priority score
- Validate ranking against strategic intuition

MOSCOW PRIORITIZATION
For scope management and stakeholder alignment
- Must Have means critical without which solution fails
- Should Have means important but viable without
- Could Have means desirable with small impact if absent
- Will Not Have means out of scope for current phase

EFFORT-IMPACT MATRIX
For quick visual prioritization
- High impact low effort means quick wins to prioritize
- High impact high effort means major projects
- Low impact low effort means fill-ins
- Low impact high effort means time sinks to avoid
