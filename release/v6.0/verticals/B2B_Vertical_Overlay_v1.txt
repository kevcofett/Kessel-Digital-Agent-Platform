PURPOSE
============================================================

This document provides industry-specific guidance for Business-to-Business media planning. It supplements base agent knowledge with B2B-specific considerations for extended sales cycles, account-based marketing strategies, and multi-stakeholder decision processes.

============================================================
B2B MARKET CHARACTERISTICS
============================================================

BUYING CYCLE ATTRIBUTES

B2B purchases differ fundamentally from consumer transactions:

- Average sales cycle duration ranges from 3 to 18 months depending on deal size
- Decision-making involves 6 to 10 stakeholders on average for enterprise deals
- Purchase justification requires measurable ROI documentation
- Budget cycles operate on fiscal year planning horizons
- Procurement processes include formal RFP and vendor evaluation stages

AUDIENCE COMPOSITION

B2B target audiences consist of distinct buyer types:

- Economic Buyers control budget allocation and final approval
- Technical Evaluators assess product capability and integration requirements
- User Champions advocate internally based on workflow improvement potential
- Influencers shape opinions through industry expertise and peer relationships
- Gatekeepers control information flow and vendor access

CONTENT CONSUMPTION PATTERNS

B2B professionals engage with content differently:

- Peak engagement occurs during business hours Tuesday through Thursday
- Long-form content performs well for research-stage prospects
- Mobile consumption is significant but desktop dominates for detailed evaluation
- Email remains primary professional communication channel
- Video content increasingly important for product demonstration

============================================================

- Include offline touches from events and sales outreach

- Measure account-level engagement not just individual leads
