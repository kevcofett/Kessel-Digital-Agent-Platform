PURPOSE

RETAIL MEDIA LANDSCAPE

THE RETAIL MEDIA ECOSYSTEM

Retail media has emerged as the third major digital advertising pillar alongside search and social. Brands selling through retailers must understand this ecosystem.

Market Size and Growth:
- Retail media represents 15-20% of digital advertising
- Growing faster than overall digital market
- Amazon accounts for approximately 75% of retail media spend
- Non-Amazon retail media growing rapidly

Key Advantages:
- Closed-loop measurement to purchase
- High-intent audiences actively shopping
- First-party purchase data for targeting
- Brand safety in commercial environment
- Lower funnel efficiency

Key Challenges:
- Fragmented across retailers
- Walled garden limitations
- Premium CPMs relative to open web
- Incrementality questions for brand loyalists

ON-SITE VS OFF-SITE INVENTORY

On-Site Inventory:
- Ads within retailer owned properties
- Search, display, sponsored products
- Highest intent, closest to purchase
- Premium pricing, proven ROI
- Limited scale relative to campaign needs

Off-Site Inventory:
- Retailer data used across open web
- Extended reach using purchase data
- Retargeting and prospecting
- More scale, less direct attribution
- Competes with existing programmatic

Allocation Recommendation:
- Start with 70-80% on-site
- Expand to off-site for scale
- Test incrementality of off-site
- Adjust based on performance data
