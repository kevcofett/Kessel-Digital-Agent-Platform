## Tips

- **Be specific**: "Calculate reach for $200K Meta awareness campaign" works better than "help with planning"
- **Provide context**: Budget, objective, vertical, and audience improve recommendations
- **Ask for benchmarks**: Always validate against KB data
- **Request handoffs**: "Now recommend channels based on that" triggers cross-agent flow
- **Export everything**: Ask DOC to generate documents for any analysis
