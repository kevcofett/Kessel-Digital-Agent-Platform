PURPOSE

This knowledge base provides the Analytics Agent with comprehensive statistical significance methodology including hypothesis testing, power analysis, and best practices for marketing experiment evaluation.

SIGNIFICANCE TESTING FUNDAMENTALS

Understanding hypothesis testing.

HYPOTHESIS TESTING CONCEPT

What significance testing achieves.

Null hypothesis
- Default assumption
- No effect statement
- Skeptical position
- Rejection target

Alternative hypothesis
- Research claim
- Effect presence
- Directional or non-directional
- Evidence goal

Decision process
- Evidence evaluation
- Null rejection decision
- Type I and II errors
- Uncertainty acknowledgment

P-VALUE CONCEPT

Probability interpretation.

P-value definition
- Probability of observed or more extreme
- Given null hypothesis true
- Evidence strength
- Not probability null is true

P-value interpretation
- Smaller indicates stronger evidence
- Threshold-based decision
- Not effect size measure
- Context dependence

Common thresholds
- 0.05 standard threshold
- 0.01 stricter threshold
- 0.10 lenient threshold
- Business alignment

SIGNIFICANCE VERSUS PRACTICAL

Statistical versus business relevance.

Statistical significance
- Unlikely under null
- Sample size dependent
- Detectable difference
- May be small effect

Practical significance
- Business meaningful
- Worth acting on
- Effect size focus
- Decision relevant

Reconciliation
- Both required
- Effect size reporting
- Confidence intervals
- Business interpretation

COMMON TESTS

Standard statistical tests.

PROPORTION TESTS

Binary outcome testing.

One-proportion test
- Population proportion test
- Conversion rate test
- Binomial or normal approximation
- Sample size consideration

Two-proportion test
- Group comparison
- A/B test basis
- Chi-square or Z-test
- Independent samples

Fisher exact test
- Small sample alternative
- Exact probability
- Computationally intensive
- Conservative inference

MEAN TESTS

Continuous outcome testing.

One-sample t-test
- Population mean test
- Single group
- Normal assumption
- Small sample capable

Two-sample t-test
- Group mean comparison
- Independent samples
- Equal or unequal variance
- Welch test recommended

Paired t-test
- Matched samples
- Before-after design
- Within-subject comparison
- Reduced variance

NON-PARAMETRIC TESTS

Distribution-free alternatives.

Mann-Whitney U test
- Rank-based comparison
- Two independent groups
- No normality assumption
- Median-focused

Wilcoxon signed-rank
- Paired data alternative
- Rank-based
- Distribution-free
- Symmetric assumption

POWER ANALYSIS

Detection capability assessment.

POWER CONCEPT

What statistical power means.

Power definition
- Probability of rejection when alternative true
- True positive rate
- Sensitivity
- Detection capability

Power determinants
- Effect size
- Sample size
- Significance level
- Variance

Conventional targets
- 80 percent common
- 90 percent stringent
- Higher for critical tests
- Cost consideration

SAMPLE SIZE PLANNING

Determining required sample.

Power-based calculation
- Specify power target
- Specify significance level
- Specify minimum detectable effect
- Solve for sample size

Effect size specification
- Business minimum difference
- Historical data basis
- Literature guidance
- Conservative approach

Practical constraints
- Budget limitations
- Time constraints
- Available population
- Feasibility balance

UNDERPOWERED STUDIES

Low power consequences.

Detection failure
- Miss true effects
- False negatives
- Type II errors
- Wasted resources

Effect inflation
- Winner curse
- Significant effects exaggerated
- Publication bias
- Misleading conclusions

MULTIPLE TESTING

Handling multiple comparisons.

MULTIPLE TESTING PROBLEM

Why multiple tests inflate error.

Family-wise error rate
- Probability of any false positive
- Increases with test count
- Alpha inflation
- Spurious findings

False discovery rate
- Expected proportion false
- Among declared significant
- Alternative control
- Less conservative

CORRECTION METHODS

Adjusting for multiplicity.

Bonferroni correction
- Divide alpha by test count
- Very conservative
- Simple application
- Power reduction

Benjamini-Hochberg
- FDR control
- Less conservative
- Ordered p-values
- Adjusted threshold

Pre-specification
- Define tests in advance
- Limit primary tests
- Exploratory versus confirmatory
- Protocol protection

A/B TESTING SIGNIFICANCE

Experiment evaluation.

TEST DESIGN

Proper A/B test setup.

Hypothesis specification
- Clear null hypothesis
- Defined alternative
- One-sided or two-sided
- Primary metric focus

Sample size calculation
- Power analysis
- Minimum detectable effect
- Duration planning
- Resource allocation

Randomization
- Proper random assignment
- Balance verification
- Stratification option
- Quality assurance

TEST ANALYSIS

Evaluating A/B results.

Statistical test selection
- Proportion test for rates
- T-test for means
- Non-parametric option
- Metric-appropriate

Result interpretation
- P-value assessment
- Effect size reporting
- Confidence interval
- Business relevance

Decision making
- Significance threshold
- Practical threshold
- Confidence level
- Action determination
