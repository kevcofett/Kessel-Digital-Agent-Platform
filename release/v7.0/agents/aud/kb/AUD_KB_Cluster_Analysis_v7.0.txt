SECTION 1 - CLUSTERING FUNDAMENTALS
================================================================================

CLUSTER ANALYSIS DEFINITION

Cluster analysis groups customers based on similarity across multiple attributes without predefined categories. Unlike RFM which uses fixed dimensions, clustering discovers natural groupings in data.

CLUSTERING VS SEGMENTATION

PREDEFINED SEGMENTATION
- Dimensions chosen by analyst
- Fixed boundaries (age bands, spend tiers)
- Easy to interpret and implement
- May miss natural patterns

DATA-DRIVEN CLUSTERING
- Dimensions emerge from data
- Boundaries determined by algorithm
- Discovers unexpected groupings
- Requires interpretation effort

WHEN TO USE CLUSTERING

USE CLUSTERING WHEN
- Exploring customer base structure
- Existing segments feel arbitrary
- Looking for actionable micro-segments
- Combining many attributes

USE PREDEFINED SEGMENTATION WHEN
- Business rules require fixed categories
- Need consistent reporting over time
- Limited analytical resources
- Regulatory requirements dictate categories

================================================================================
SECTION 2 - K-MEANS CLUSTERING
================================================================================

K-MEANS ALGORITHM

K-means partitions customers into K clusters by minimizing within-cluster variance.

ALGORITHM STEPS
- Choose number of clusters K
- Initialize K cluster centers randomly
- Assign each customer to nearest center
- Recalculate centers as cluster means
- Repeat steps 3-4 until convergence

DISTANCE CALCULATION
Euclidean distance commonly used:
Distance = sqrt(sum((Xi - Ci)^2))

Where:
- Xi is customer value on dimension i
- Ci is cluster center value on dimension i

FEATURE SCALING REQUIREMENT

Features must be scaled before clustering to prevent high-magnitude features from dominating.

STANDARDIZATION (Z-SCORE)
Scaled_Value = (Original_Value - Mean) / Standard_Deviation

Result: Mean of 0, standard deviation of 1

MIN-MAX NORMALIZATION
Scaled_Value = (Original_Value - Min) / (Max - Min)

Result: Range from 0 to 1

CHOOSING NUMBER OF CLUSTERS (K)

ELBOW METHOD
- Run K-means for K = 2 through K = 15
- Calculate within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) for each K
- Plot WCSS against K
- Find elbow point where improvement diminishes

SILHOUETTE ANALYSIS
- Calculate silhouette score for each customer
- Silhouette = (b - a) / max(a, b)
   Where: a = avg distance to same cluster, b = avg distance to nearest other cluster
- Average across customers
- Higher average silhouette indicates better clustering
- Optimal K maximizes average silhouette

PRACTICAL GUIDELINES
- Start with K = 5 to 8 for customer segmentation
- Ensure clusters are actionable (not too many)
- Minimum cluster size: 5 percent of population
- Maximum clusters: 10 for practical application

================================================================================
SECTION 3 - HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING
================================================================================

HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING OVERVIEW

Hierarchical clustering builds a tree of clusters (dendrogram) showing relationships between customers and groups at multiple levels.

AGGLOMERATIVE APPROACH (BOTTOM-UP)
- Start with each customer as own cluster
- Merge two most similar clusters
- Repeat until single cluster remains
- Cut dendrogram at desired level

LINKAGE METHODS

SINGLE LINKAGE
Distance between clusters = minimum distance between any two points
- Tends to create elongated clusters
- Sensitive to outliers

COMPLETE LINKAGE
Distance between clusters = maximum distance between any two points
- Tends to create compact clusters
- More robust to outliers

AVERAGE LINKAGE
Distance between clusters = average of all pairwise distances
- Balance between single and complete
- Most commonly used

WARD LINKAGE
Merge clusters that minimize increase in total within-cluster variance
- Creates compact, similarly-sized clusters
- Best for most marketing applications

DENDROGRAM INTERPRETATION

DENDROGRAM STRUCTURE
- Height indicates distance at which clusters merge
- Horizontal cuts create different numbers of clusters
- Large vertical gaps suggest natural cluster boundaries

CHOOSING CUT POINT
- Cut where gaps between merge heights are largest
- Consider business requirements for number of segments
- Validate with cluster profiling

================================================================================
SECTION 4 - CLUSTER PROFILING AND INTERPRETATION
================================================================================

CLUSTER PROFILING PROCESS

After clustering, characterize each cluster to enable targeting and messaging.

PROFILING DIMENSIONS

DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE
- Age distribution vs. population
- Gender split vs. population
- Geographic concentration
- Income indicators

BEHAVIORAL PROFILE
- Average order value vs. population
- Purchase frequency vs. population
- Product category affinity
- Channel preferences
- Time-of-day patterns

VALUE PROFILE
- Average LTV by cluster
- LTV distribution within cluster
- CAC by acquisition source
- Margin contribution

ENGAGEMENT PROFILE
- Email engagement rates
- Site visit frequency
- App usage patterns
- Social engagement

CLUSTER NAMING CONVENTION

Create descriptive names that capture cluster essence:

NAMING APPROACH
- Use dominant characteristic
- Keep names memorable
- Avoid jargon
- Enable intuitive targeting

EXAMPLE CLUSTER NAMES
- High Value Loyalists (high spend, high frequency)
- Bargain Hunters (price sensitive, promotion responsive)
- New Enthusiasts (recent, high engagement, low history)
- Lapsing Regulars (declining frequency, historical value)
- Window Shoppers (high browse, low convert)

CLUSTER STABILITY ANALYSIS

STABILITY TESTING
- Run clustering on random 80 percent samples multiple times
- Measure how consistently customers are assigned to same cluster
- Stability score = percent consistent assignment

INTERPRETATION
- Stability above 80 percent: Robust clusters
- Stability 60-80 percent: Moderate robustness
- Stability below 60 percent: Consider different K or features

================================================================================
SECTION 5 - AUDIENCE SIZING AND OVERLAP
================================================================================

AUDIENCE SIZE ESTIMATION

KNOWN AUDIENCE SIZE
Direct count from customer database or platform.

MODELED AUDIENCE SIZE
When exact count unavailable, estimate from:
Estimated_Size = Population x Penetration_Rate

Where penetration rate comes from surveys, panel data, or platform estimates.

ADDRESSABLE AUDIENCE CALCULATION
Addressable = Total_Audience x Platform_Match_Rate x Active_Rate

Where:
- Platform_Match_Rate: Percent matched to ad platform
- Active_Rate: Percent active on platform

AUDIENCE OVERLAP ANALYSIS

OVERLAP CALCULATION
When two audiences share members:

Simple Overlap
Overlap_Percent = Shared_Members / Smaller_Audience_Size x 100

Jaccard Similarity
Jaccard = Intersection / Union = A_and_B / (A + B - A_and_B)

OVERLAP IMPLICATIONS

HIGH OVERLAP (ABOVE 50 PERCENT)
- Audiences are largely redundant
- Consider consolidating
- Risk of frequency issues if both targeted

MODERATE OVERLAP (20-50 PERCENT)
- Some redundancy exists
- Coordinate frequency across audiences
- May serve different purposes

LOW OVERLAP (BELOW 20 PERCENT)
- Audiences are distinct
- Can target independently
- Combined reach is roughly additive

DEDUPLICATION FORMULAS

COMBINED UNIQUE REACH (TWO AUDIENCES)
Unique_Reach = Audience_A + Audience_B - Overlap

COMBINED UNIQUE REACH (MULTIPLE AUDIENCES)
Using inclusion-exclusion principle:
Unique = Sum(Individual) - Sum(Pairwise Overlaps) + Sum(Triple Overlaps) - ...

SIMPLIFIED ESTIMATE (WHEN OVERLAP UNKNOWN)
Unique_Reach = 1 - Product((1 - Reach_i))

Where Reach_i is each audience as percent of total.

SECTION 6 - CLUSTER-BASED MEDIA PLANNING
================================================================================

CLUSTER PRIORITIZATION MATRIX

PRIORITIZATION FORMULA
Priority_Score = Cluster_Size x Average_LTV x Conversion_Propensity

BUDGET ALLOCATION BY CLUSTER
Cluster_Budget = Total_Budget x (Cluster_Priority_Score / Sum_All_Priority_Scores)

LOOKALIKE MODELING FROM CLUSTERS

SEED AUDIENCE SELECTION
Use highest value clusters as seeds for lookalike modeling:

SEED QUALITY METRICS
- Minimum seed size: 1,000 customers (platform dependent)
- Optimal seed size: 10,000 to 50,000 customers
- Seed quality: Higher LTV seeds produce higher value lookalikes

LOOKALIKE EXPANSION LEVELS
- 1 percent lookalike: Most similar, smallest reach
- 3-5 percent lookalike: Balance of similarity and scale
- 10 percent lookalike: Broad reach, lower similarity

EXPECTED LOOKALIKE PERFORMANCE
Lookalike_Performance = Seed_Performance x Similarity_Decay_Factor

Typical decay factors:
- 1 percent lookalike: 0.6-0.8 of seed performance
- 5 percent lookalike: 0.4-0.6 of seed performance
- 10 percent lookalike: 0.2-0.4 of seed performance
