SECTION 1 - HOUSEHOLD DEFINITION
================================================================================

OVERVIEW

Household resolution creates unified views of individuals sharing a physical dwelling for the purpose of marketing coordination and reach deduplication. Households represent a critical level of identity resolution between individual and geographic aggregations. Accurate household identification enables proper frequency capping across household members, coordinated messaging strategies, and understanding of household-level purchase decisions.

The challenge of household resolution stems from the varied definitions of what constitutes a household for different marketing purposes. A household for direct mail purposes differs from a household for addressable television, which differs again from a household for cross-device digital coordination. This document provides comprehensive guidance on household definition approaches and resolution techniques.

HOUSEHOLD DEFINITION FRAMEWORKS

Census-Based Definition
- Housing unit occupied by one or more persons as primary residence
- Includes all persons living in the same dwelling
- Group quarters such as dormitories and nursing homes treated separately
- Household excludes second homes and vacation properties
- Official statistics based on this definition enable benchmarking

Marketing-Based Definition
- Persons sharing purchase decision authority for product category
- May include extended family members not residing together
- Excludes temporary residents such as college students at school
- Includes domestic partners regardless of legal relationship
- Practical focus on marketing coordination requirements

Device-Based Definition
- Devices sharing same home network form household cluster
- Smart TV household includes all devices on home WiFi
- Mobile devices may or may not be included based on use patterns
- Visitor devices temporarily appear in household
- Definition depends on technical implementation

Address-Based Definition
- All individuals registered at same mailing address
- Multi-unit buildings require apartment or unit number
- PO Box addresses complicate physical residence inference
- Address standardization critical for accurate matching

================================================================================
SECTION 2 - ADDRESS STANDARDIZATION
================================================================================

================================================================================
SECTION 3 - DEVICE CLUSTERING
================================================================================

OVERVIEW

Device clustering identifies devices belonging to the same household through shared network presence, location patterns, and behavioral signals. This approach enables household-level targeting in digital channels where physical address is unavailable.

NETWORK-BASED CLUSTERING

IP Address Clustering
- Shared residential IP address indicates same household
- DHCP lease duration affects IP stability
- ISP assignment patterns vary by provider
- NAT traversal reveals multiple devices behind single IP
- VPN usage complicates IP-based household identification

WiFi Network Identification
- Same SSID suggests same household network
- BSSID provides more precise network identification
- Guest network devices may not be household members
- Mesh network nodes share household membership
- Network name changes require linkage maintenance

Router-Level Signals
- Connected device inventory from router data
- MAC address collection for device identification
- Device naming conventions reveal relationships
- Connection time patterns indicate primary residents
- Bandwidth usage patterns distinguish device types

LOCATION-BASED CLUSTERING

Overnight Location Patterns
- Consistent overnight location indicates residence
- Latitude and longitude precision affects accuracy
- Dwell time thresholds distinguish residents from visitors
- Multiple overnight locations suggest split residence
- Location permission coverage limits this approach

Geofence-Based Household Assignment
- Geofence around residential coordinates
- Entry and exit events track device presence
- Dwell time within geofence indicates residence
- Multiple devices within same geofence clustered
- Geofence precision must balance accuracy and privacy

Address-to-Coordinate Matching
- Known device locations matched to address coordinates
- Geocoded household addresses provide matching targets
- Distance threshold determines match acceptance
- Urban density affects matching precision requirements
- Multiple addresses within threshold need disambiguation

- Shared shipping addresses link devices
- Gift purchases from one device to another household member
- Household supply purchases indicate primary shopper
- Recurring delivery schedules reveal household routines

DEVICE GRAPH CONSTRUCTION

Graph Architecture
