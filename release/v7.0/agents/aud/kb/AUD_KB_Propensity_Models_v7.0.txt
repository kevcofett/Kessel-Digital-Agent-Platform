SECTION 1 - PROPENSITY SCORING FUNDAMENTALS
================================================================================

PROPENSITY SCORE DEFINITION

A propensity score is the probability that a customer will take a specific action (convert, churn, upgrade, respond to offer) given their observable characteristics. Propensity models enable targeting based on predicted behavior rather than historical segments alone.

PROPENSITY TYPES

CONVERSION PROPENSITY
- Probability of purchase within defined window
- Use for: Prospecting prioritization, bid optimization
- Typical output: Score 0-100 representing percent likelihood

CHURN PROPENSITY
- Probability of lapsing or canceling
- Use for: Retention targeting, win-back timing
- Typical output: Risk score with urgency indicator

UPSELL PROPENSITY
- Probability of purchasing premium or additional products
- Use for: Cross-sell campaign targeting
- Typical output: Product-specific probability scores

RESPONSE PROPENSITY
- Probability of responding to marketing treatment
- Use for: Campaign efficiency, contact strategy
- Typical output: Response likelihood by channel

SECTION 2 - LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELS
================================================================================

LOGISTIC REGRESSION FUNDAMENTALS

Logistic regression predicts binary outcomes (convert/not convert) using the logistic function to constrain predictions between 0 and 1.

LOGISTIC FUNCTION
P(Y=1) = 1 / (1 + e^-(B0 + B1X1 + B2X2 + ... + BnXn))

Where:
- P(Y=1) is probability of positive outcome
- B0 is intercept (baseline log-odds)
- B1 through Bn are feature coefficients
- X1 through Xn are feature values

INTERPRETING COEFFICIENTS

Coefficients represent change in log-odds per unit change in feature.

ODDS RATIO CALCULATION
Odds_Ratio = e^Coefficient

INTERPRETATION GUIDE
- Odds ratio of 1.0: No effect
- Odds ratio greater than 1.0: Increases probability
- Odds ratio less than 1.0: Decreases probability

EXAMPLE
- Coefficient for email_opens = 0.15
- Odds ratio = e^0.15 = 1.16
- Interpretation: Each additional email open increases conversion odds by 16 percent

FEATURE SELECTION FOR PROPENSITY MODELS

BEHAVIORAL FEATURES (STRONGEST PREDICTORS)
- Recency of last engagement or purchase
- Frequency of interactions in period
- Time spent on site or in app
- Pages or products viewed
- Cart additions without purchase
- Email engagement (opens, clicks)
- Search queries entered

DEMOGRAPHIC FEATURES (MODERATE PREDICTORS)
- Age or age band
- Geographic region
- Device type
- Operating system
- Time zone

CONTEXTUAL FEATURES (SITUATIONAL PREDICTORS)
- Day of week
- Time of day
- Season or holiday proximity
- Weather conditions
- Competitive promotions active

HISTORICAL FEATURES (BASELINE PREDICTORS)
- Previous purchase count
- Lifetime value to date
- Days since first purchase
- Product categories purchased
- Return rate

MODEL EVALUATION METRICS

AUC-ROC (AREA UNDER RECEIVER OPERATING CURVE)
- Measures discrimination ability
- Range: 0.5 (random) to 1.0 (perfect)
- Acceptable: 0.70 or higher
- Good: 0.80 or higher
- Excellent: 0.90 or higher

GINI COEFFICIENT
- Gini = 2 x AUC - 1
- Range: 0 (random) to 1 (perfect)
- Related to AUC but different scale

PRECISION AND RECALL
- Precision: True positives / Predicted positives
- Recall: True positives / Actual positives
- Trade-off depends on use case

F1 SCORE
- F1 = 2 x (Precision x Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
- Harmonic mean balancing precision and recall

================================================================================
SECTION 3 - DECILE ANALYSIS AND TARGETING
================================================================================

DECILE RANKING METHODOLOGY

After scoring all customers, rank by propensity score and divide into 10 equal groups (deciles).

DECILE CONSTRUCTION
- Decile 1: Top 10 percent by score (highest propensity)
- Decile 2: Next 10 percent
- Continue through Decile 10 (lowest propensity)

LIFT ANALYSIS

LIFT DEFINITION
Lift measures how much better the model performs compared to random selection.

LIFT FORMULA
Lift = Decile_Response_Rate / Overall_Response_Rate

EXAMPLE CALCULATION
- Overall response rate: 2 percent
- Decile 1 response rate: 12 percent
- Lift = 12 / 2 = 6.0x

CUMULATIVE LIFT
- Shows performance when selecting top N deciles
- Useful for setting targeting thresholds

GAINS CHART

GAINS DEFINITION
Percentage of total responders captured by targeting top N deciles.

GAINS FORMULA
Gains_at_Decile_N = Cumulative_Responders_in_Top_N / Total_Responders

EXAMPLE GAINS TABLE
- Top 1 decile: Captures 35 percent of responders
- Top 2 deciles: Captures 55 percent of responders
- Top 3 deciles: Captures 70 percent of responders
- Top 5 deciles: Captures 85 percent of responders

OPTIMAL TARGETING DEPTH

BREAKEVEN CALCULATION
Breakeven_Response_Rate = Cost_Per_Contact / (Revenue_Per_Response x Margin)

TARGETING RULE
Target all deciles where predicted response rate exceeds breakeven rate.

EXAMPLE
- Cost per contact: $0.50
- Revenue per response: $100
- Margin: 40 percent
- Breakeven = $0.50 / ($100 x 0.40) = 1.25 percent
- Target deciles with response rate above 1.25 percent

SECTION 4 - BEHAVIORAL SCORING BEYOND RFM
================================================================================

ENGAGEMENT SCORING

Engagement scores capture depth and quality of customer interaction beyond simple transaction metrics.

ENGAGEMENT SCORE COMPONENTS

SITE ENGAGEMENT
- Pages per session (weight: 15 percent)
- Time on site (weight: 15 percent)
- Return visits (weight: 20 percent)
- Search queries (weight: 10 percent)

EMAIL ENGAGEMENT
- Open rate vs. average (weight: 15 percent)
- Click rate vs. average (weight: 15 percent)
- Recency of engagement (weight: 10 percent)

COMPOSITE ENGAGEMENT SCORE
Engagement_Score = Sum of (Component_Value x Weight) normalized to 0-100

INTENT SCORING

Intent scores predict near-term purchase likelihood based on in-session behavior.

HIGH INTENT SIGNALS (WEIGHT: 3X)
- Added to cart
- Viewed pricing page
- Started checkout
- Compared products
- Searched for specific product

MEDIUM INTENT SIGNALS (WEIGHT: 2X)
- Viewed product detail page
- Read reviews
- Checked availability
- Viewed shipping info
- Multiple category views

LOW INTENT SIGNALS (WEIGHT: 1X)
- Homepage visit
- Category browse
- Blog content view
- About page view

INTENT SCORE CALCULATION
Intent_Score = Sum of (Signal_Count x Signal_Weight) / Max_Possible_Score x 100

VELOCITY SCORING

Velocity captures rate of change in customer behavior, identifying acceleration or deceleration.

VELOCITY COMPONENTS
- Purchase frequency trend (increasing/stable/decreasing)
- Engagement trend (rising/flat/falling)
- Spend trend (growing/stable/declining)

VELOCITY SCORE CALCULATION
Velocity = (Recent_Period_Metric - Prior_Period_Metric) / Prior_Period_Metric x 100

INTERPRETATION
- Positive velocity: Customer accelerating
- Zero velocity: Customer stable
- Negative velocity: Customer decelerating (churn risk)

================================================================================
SECTION 5 - MULTI-MODEL ENSEMBLE APPROACHES
================================================================================

ENSEMBLE FUNDAMENTALS

Combining multiple models often outperforms any single model by reducing variance and capturing different signal types.

ENSEMBLE METHODS

SIMPLE AVERAGING
Final_Score = (Model_A_Score + Model_B_Score + Model_C_Score) / 3

Use when: Models have similar performance, quick implementation needed

WEIGHTED AVERAGING
Final_Score = (W1 x Model_A) + (W2 x Model_B) + (W3 x Model_C)
Where: W1 + W2 + W3 = 1.0

Use when: Models have different strengths, weights based on validation performance

STACKING
Train meta-model using individual model outputs as features.

Use when: Maximum accuracy required, sufficient data for meta-model training

MODEL COMBINATION STRATEGIES

COMBINING BEHAVIORAL AND CONTEXTUAL
- Behavioral model: Based on historical customer actions
- Contextual model: Based on real-time session signals
- Combined: Behavioral provides baseline, contextual adjusts for current intent

COMBINING DEMOGRAPHIC AND BEHAVIORAL
- Demographic model: Broad population-level patterns
- Behavioral model: Individual-level patterns
- Combined: Demographic for new customers, behavioral for known customers

FALLBACK STRATEGY
When individual-level data unavailable:
- Use individual model if history exists
- Fall back to segment-level model
- Fall back to population average

================================================================================

PROPENSITY SCORE USAGE IN MEDIA PLANNING

BID OPTIMIZATION
- Higher propensity customers justify higher bids
- Bid multiplier = Base_Bid x (1 + Propensity_Score_Percent / 100)
- Cap multipliers to prevent overspending

AUDIENCE PRIORITIZATION
- Rank audiences by average propensity score
- Allocate budget proportional to expected value
- Expected_Value = Audience_Size x Avg_Propensity x Revenue_Per_Conversion

SUPPRESSION LOGIC
- Suppress low propensity customers from expensive channels
- Threshold: Typically suppress below 20th percentile
- Exception: Brand building campaigns may include all

FREQUENCY OPTIMIZATION
- Higher propensity customers can receive higher frequency
- Lower propensity customers need frequency caps to avoid waste

SCORE INTERPRETATION GUIDANCE

SCORE ABOVE 80
- High likelihood of action
- Prioritize for premium placements
- Higher frequency acceptable
- Full channel activation

SCORE 50 TO 80
- Moderate likelihood
- Standard targeting approach
- Monitor for score changes
- Test creative variations

SCORE 20 TO 50
- Low likelihood
- Cost-efficient channels only
- Lower frequency caps
- Promotional offers may help

SCORE BELOW 20
- Very low likelihood
- Consider suppression
- Only include in broad awareness
- Reactivation campaigns if lapsed
