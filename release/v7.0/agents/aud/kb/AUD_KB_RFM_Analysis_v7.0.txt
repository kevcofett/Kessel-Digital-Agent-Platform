PURPOSE

This knowledge base provides the Audience Agent with comprehensive RFM analysis methodology including scoring approaches, segmentation frameworks, and best practices for customer value segmentation.

RFM ANALYSIS FUNDAMENTALS

Understanding Recency, Frequency, Monetary segmentation.

RFM CONCEPT

What RFM analysis measures.

Recency
- Time since last purchase
- Engagement freshness
- Activity indicator
- Churn signal

Frequency
- Purchase count
- Engagement level
- Loyalty indicator
- Habit strength

Monetary
- Purchase value
- Revenue contribution
- Customer importance
- Value indicator

RFM VALUE PROPOSITION

Why RFM works.

Behavioral foundation
- Actual behavior based
- Historical patterns
- Predictive validity
- Simple and powerful

Practical application
- Easy to calculate
- Widely applicable
- Interpretable results
- Actionable segments

Predictive relationship
- Recency predicts response
- Frequency indicates loyalty
- Monetary shows value
- Combined power

RFM CALCULATION

Computing RFM metrics.

RECENCY CALCULATION

Time since last activity.

Recency definition
- Days since last purchase
- Days since last engagement
- Days since last visit
- Measurement point

Calculation approach
- Current date minus last date
- Lower values are better
- Capping considerations
- Handling missing values

Data requirements
- Transaction history
- Timestamp accuracy
- Customer identification
- Complete history

FREQUENCY CALCULATION

Count of activities.

Frequency definition
- Transaction count
- Engagement count
- Visit count
- Time period bounded

Calculation approach
- Count within period
- Annualized option
- Higher values are better
- Outlier consideration

Period selection
- Analysis period
- Business cycle alignment
- Data availability
- Comparability

MONETARY CALCULATION

Value of activities.

Monetary definition
- Total spend
- Average order value
- Margin contribution
- Revenue focus

Calculation approach
- Sum within period
- Average option
- Gross versus net
- Currency consistency

Value adjustments
- Return handling
- Discount consideration
- Margin versus revenue
- Inflation adjustment

RFM SCORING

Assigning RFM scores.

QUANTILE SCORING

Distribution-based scoring.

Quintile approach
- Five equal groups
- Distribution based
- Relative ranking
- Standard method

Scoring direction
- Recency inverse scoring
- Frequency direct scoring
- Monetary direct scoring
- Higher score is better

Score assignment
- Percentile calculation
- Bucket assignment
- Edge case handling
- Consistent methodology

FIXED THRESHOLD SCORING

Business rule-based scoring.

Threshold definition
- Business-defined cutoffs
- Domain knowledge
- Consistent over time
- Interpretable boundaries

Threshold examples
- Recency within 30 days is 5
- Frequency over 10 is 5
- Monetary over 1000 is 5
- Business aligned
