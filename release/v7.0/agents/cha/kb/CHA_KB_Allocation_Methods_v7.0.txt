CHA ALLOCATION METHODS v1

PURPOSE

This document provides budget allocation formulas and optimization approaches for the Channel Strategy Agent. Reference this document when distributing budgets across channels, handling constraints, and identifying reallocation triggers.

ALLOCATION PRINCIPLES

PRINCIPLE 1: DIMINISHING RETURNS

Every channel has a saturation point where additional spend yields decreasing returns. Marginal efficiency declines as:
- Frequency exceeds optimal range
- Audience pool depletes
- Competition increases for same inventory
- Creative fatigue accumulates

Formula Application:
- Efficiency Index = (Conversions at Budget N) / (Conversions at Budget N-1)
- Healthy Range: 0.85-1.00
- Warning Zone: 0.70-0.84
- Reallocation Trigger: Below 0.70

PRINCIPLE 2: MINIMUM VIABLE INVESTMENT

Underfunded channels cannot optimize. Platform algorithms require sufficient data volume. Below minimums:
- Learning phases extend indefinitely
- Delivery becomes inconsistent
- Optimization signals insufficient
- Wasted spend on ineffective reach

Approach: Fund fewer channels properly rather than many channels poorly.

PRINCIPLE 3: FULL FUNNEL BALANCE

Imbalanced funnels create inefficiency:
- Upper heavy: Demand without capture
- Lower heavy: Capture without demand generation
- Missing mid: Poor conversion rates

Rebalancing requires 4-8 weeks to show impact due to customer journey timelines.

ALLOCATION FORMULAS

OBJECTIVE-BASED ALLOCATION

Awareness Objective Formula:
- Upper Funnel: 60-70%
- Mid Funnel: 20-30%
- Lower Funnel: 10-20%

Consideration Objective Formula:
- Upper Funnel: 30-40%
- Mid Funnel: 40-50%
- Lower Funnel: 20-30%

Performance Objective Formula:
- Upper Funnel: 20-30%
- Mid Funnel: 20-30%
- Lower Funnel: 40-60%

Retention Objective Formula:
- Upper Funnel: 10-20%
- Mid Funnel: 20-30%
- Lower Funnel: 50-70%

BUDGET TIER ALLOCATION

Small Budget (Under 50K monthly):
- Maximum Channels: 3-4
- Primary Channel: 40-50%
- Secondary Channel: 25-35%
- Tertiary Channels: 15-25% combined
- Test Budget: 0% (insufficient scale)

Medium Budget (50K-250K monthly):
- Maximum Channels: 4-6
- Primary Channel: 30-40%
- Secondary Channels: 20-30% each
- Tertiary Channels: 10-15% each
- Test Budget: 10-15%

Large Budget (250K-1M monthly):
- Maximum Channels: 6-8
- Primary Channels: 20-30% each
- Secondary Channels: 15-20% each
- Tertiary Channels: 5-10% each
- Test Budget: 15-20%

Enterprise Budget (Over 1M monthly):
- Maximum Channels: 8-12
- Primary Channels: 15-25% each
- Secondary Channels: 10-15% each
- Tertiary Channels: 5-10% each
- Test Budget: 20-25%

CHANNEL CONCENTRATION LIMITS

Single Channel Maximum: 40% of total budget
- Exception: Search for high-intent performance campaigns up to 50%
- Rationale: Risk diversification, diminishing returns

Category Maximum: 50% in any single category
- Exception: Retail media for ecommerce up to 60%
- Rationale: Channel diversity, audience variation

Minimum Per Channel: 5% of total or platform minimum
- If below 5%, evaluate channel necessity
- Below platform minimum is wasted spend

OPTIMIZATION APPROACHES

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

Efficiency-Based Reallocation:
- Rank channels by efficiency metric (CPA, ROAS, or CPM depending on objective)
- Identify top performers (top 25%)
- Identify underperformers (bottom 25%)
- Shift 10-20% from underperformers to top performers
- Maintain minimum viable budgets
- Evaluate after 2-4 weeks

Marginal Return Optimization:
- Calculate marginal CPA/ROAS for each channel
- Compare marginal efficiency to average
- If marginal efficiency less than 70% of average, reduce budget
- If marginal efficiency greater than average, increase budget
- Rebalance until marginal efficiency equalizes across channels

Frequency Optimization:
- Monitor frequency across all channels
- Target optimal frequency by channel type
- Reduce budget on channels exceeding optimal frequency
- Reallocate to channels with room to grow

AWARENESS OPTIMIZATION

Reach Optimization:
- Calculate incremental reach per additional spend
- When reach curve flattens (less than 2% incremental), reallocate
- Prioritize channels with untapped reach potential
- Consider audience overlap between channels

Brand Lift Optimization:
- Measure brand lift by channel where available
- Calculate cost per point of brand lift
- Reallocate toward channels with highest lift efficiency
- Maintain minimum presence in complementary channels

Share of Voice Optimization:
- Estimate competitive spend by channel
- Target share of voice by strategic priority
- Concentrate in channels where SOV can reach threshold
- Minimum viable SOV typically 15-20% for impact

INCREMENTALITY OPTIMIZATION

Holdout Testing Approach:
- Create holdout group (10-15% of audience)
- Measure conversion difference exposed vs holdout
- Calculate incremental conversions per channel
- Reallocate based on true incrementality not attributed conversions

Geo-Based Testing:
- Select matched test and control markets
- Increase/decrease channel spend in test markets
- Measure conversion difference vs control
- Apply findings to allocation decisions

Media Mix Modeling Integration:
- If MMM data available, use coefficient estimates
- Calculate optimal allocation based on response curves
- Compare MMM recommendations to performance data
- Blend approaches for robust allocation

CONSTRAINT HANDLING

BUDGET CONSTRAINTS

Budget Reduction Scenario:
- First reduce test budget allocation
- Second reduce lowest efficiency channels
- Third reduce tertiary channels
- Maintain minimum viable in primary and secondary
- If further cuts needed, eliminate rather than underfund

Priority Sequence for Cuts:
- First: Test channels, new channels
- Second: Awareness channels (longer-term impact)
- Third: Consideration channels
- Last: Conversion channels (protect near-term revenue)

Budget Increase Scenario:
- First increase proven high-efficiency channels
- Second add test allocation for new opportunities
- Third expand to new channels meeting minimum threshold
- Fourth increase consideration for future pipeline

Priority Sequence for Increases:
- First: Channels with proven diminishing returns headroom
- Second: New channel tests at minimum viable
- Third: Awareness to fuel demand generation
- Fourth: Consideration for nurturing

PLATFORM CONSTRAINTS

Learning Phase Handling:
- Meta: 50 conversions per week minimum
- Google: 30 conversions per week minimum
- TikTok: 50 conversions per week minimum
- Solution: Broaden conversion events if volume insufficient

Inventory Constraints:
- CTV: Limited premium inventory
- Podcast Host-Read: Limited host availability
- LinkedIn: Limited B2B audience
- Solution: Book early, accept higher CPMs, diversify placements

Seasonality Constraints:
- Q4: 20-40% CPM increases typical
- January: Reduced competition, lower CPMs
- Solution: Adjust allocation for seasonal efficiency

VERTICAL CONSTRAINTS

B2B Constraints:
- LinkedIn CPMs 2-3x consumer
- Smaller audience pools
- Longer consideration cycles
- Solution: Higher CPA tolerance, longer attribution windows

Ecommerce Constraints:
- Heavy retail media requirements
- Competitive shopping environment
- Thin margins require efficiency
- Solution: Strict ROAS targets, real-time optimization

CPG Constraints:
- In-store attribution challenges
- Retailer data requirements
- Long purchase cycles
- Solution: Household reach metrics, retailer media investment

REALLOCATION TRIGGERS
