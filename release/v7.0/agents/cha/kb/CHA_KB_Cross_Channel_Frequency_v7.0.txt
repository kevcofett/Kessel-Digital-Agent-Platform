CHA CROSS-CHANNEL FREQUENCY v1

PURPOSE

This document provides guidance on managing frequency across multiple channels and platforms. Reference when users ask about frequency caps, cross-platform coordination, or audience overlap.

FREQUENCY FUNDAMENTALS

DEFINITION AND IMPORTANCE

Frequency measures the average number of times a unique user is exposed to advertising within a given time period. It is distinct from impressions, which count total exposures regardless of unique users.

Why Frequency Matters:
- Too low frequency: Message does not register, wasted reach
- Optimal frequency: Message resonates, action taken
- Too high frequency: Diminishing returns, user fatigue, wasted spend

The Rule of Effective Frequency:
Research suggests 3-10 exposures typically needed before message registers. However, this varies significantly by:
- Creative quality and distinctiveness
- Message complexity
- Purchase consideration period
- Competitive noise level
- Media environment and attention quality

OPTIMAL FREQUENCY BY OBJECTIVE

Awareness Campaigns:
- Minimum effective frequency: 3-5 exposures per week
- Recommended cap: 8-12 per week
- Goal: Build mental availability without fatigue
- Measurement: Brand lift, aided awareness

Consideration Campaigns:
- Minimum effective frequency: 5-7 exposures per week
- Recommended cap: 12-15 per week
- Goal: Drive engagement and research behavior
- Measurement: Site visits, content consumption

Conversion Campaigns:
- Minimum effective frequency: 2-4 exposures per week
- Recommended cap: 6-10 per week
- Goal: Capture demand without over-messaging
- Measurement: Conversion rate, CPA efficiency

Retargeting Campaigns:
- Minimum effective frequency: 3-5 exposures per week
- Recommended cap: 5-8 per week
- Goal: Remind and convert without annoyance
- Measurement: Conversion rate, negative feedback

FREQUENCY BY CHANNEL

Display Advertising:
- Lower attention environment
- Higher frequency needed to register
- Recommended cap: 3-5 per day, 15-25 per week
- Viewability impacts effective frequency

Video Advertising:
- Higher attention environment
- Lower frequency needed
- Recommended cap: 2-3 per day, 8-12 per week
- Completion rate indicates reception

Social Media:
- Native environment, variable attention
- Algorithm controls some exposure
- Recommended cap: 2-4 per day, 10-15 per week
- Platform controls may limit actual delivery

Connected TV:
- Highest attention environment
- Household-level targeting
- Recommended cap: 1-2 per day, 5-8 per week per household
- Shared viewing affects true individual frequency

Audio Streaming:
- Captive audience during content
- Limited skip capability
- Recommended cap: 2-3 per day, 10-15 per week
- Listener fatigue real concern

CROSS-PLATFORM CHALLENGES

THE DEDUPLICATION PROBLEM

The core challenge of cross-platform frequency is that the same user exists across multiple platforms, and advertisers cannot see this unified view.

Example Scenario:
- User sees 5 Meta ads
- Same user sees 4 YouTube ads
- Same user sees 3 programmatic display ads
- Platform-reported frequency: 5, 4, 3
- Actual user frequency: potentially 12

Identity Resolution Limitations:
- Walled gardens do not share identity data
- Logged-in users can be matched, logged-out cannot
- Mobile app to web matching incomplete
- CTV to mobile matching variable
- Identity deprecation trends worsening this

PLATFORM WALLED GARDENS

Each major platform counts frequency independently:

Meta Ecosystem:
- Cross-property frequency within Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp
- Cannot see Google, TikTok, programmatic exposure
- Audience Network extends visibility slightly

Google Ecosystem:
- Cross-property frequency within Search, YouTube, Display Network
- Cannot see Meta, TikTok, other programmatic
- Logged-in users enable better cross-device

TikTok:
- Platform-only frequency visibility
- Limited cross-device within platform
- No visibility to other channels

Programmatic (Open Web):
- DSP can manage frequency across open web
- Cannot see walled garden exposure
- Cookie deprecation reducing capability

MEASUREMENT GAPS

CTV Household vs Individual:
- CTV targets households, not people
- 2.5 average viewers per household
- Frequency cap of 5 to household = 2 per person average
- Some viewers may see none, others all
- True individual frequency unknown

Cross-Device Tracking:
- Logged-in user tracking most reliable
- Probabilistic matching less accurate
- Privacy changes reducing capability
- Accept measurement uncertainty

FREQUENCY MANAGEMENT APPROACHES

PLATFORM-LEVEL CAPS

The foundation of frequency management is setting appropriate caps within each platform.

Meta Best Practices:
- Set frequency caps at ad set level
- Use 1-day, 7-day, and 28-day windows
- Awareness: 2 per week cap
- Consideration: 3-5 per week cap
- Conversion: 1-2 per day cap

Google/YouTube Best Practices:
- Set frequency caps at campaign level
- Use impression and view-based caps
- Display: 3-5 impressions per day
- YouTube: 3-5 views per week
- Discovery: Let algorithm optimize

Programmatic DSP Best Practices:
- Set frequency caps at line item or campaign level
- Use cross-publisher frequency management
- Enable device graph for cross-device
- Display: 3-5 per day per publisher
- Video: 2-3 per day total

UNIFIED FREQUENCY MANAGEMENT

Some DSPs offer cross-platform frequency management capabilities.

Requirements:
- Identity solution integration (LiveRamp, UID2)
- Clean room for walled garden matching
- Sufficient match rates for effectiveness

Approach:
- Set total frequency goal across all channels
- Allocate exposure budget by channel
- Use suppression lists to avoid over-exposure
- Monitor total reach vs frequency trade-off

Limitations:
- Match rates typically 40-60% of audience
- Walled gardens require special integration
- Real-time suppression has latency
- Adds technology cost and complexity

SEQUENTIAL MESSAGING

Rather than just capping frequency, use it strategically for message sequencing.

Story-Based Frequency:
- Exposure 1: Awareness/brand message
- Exposure 2-3: Consideration/features message
- Exposure 4-5: Conversion/offer message
- Exposure 6+: Reminder/urgency message

Implementation:
- Set up sequential creative rotation
- Use frequency-based audience segmentation
- Requires cross-channel view where possible
- Accept some users will miss sequence steps

OVERLAP ANALYSIS

AUDIENCE OVERLAP BENCHMARKS

Typical overlap percentages between major platforms (US market):

Meta to YouTube: 75-85% overlap
Meta to TikTok: 40-60% overlap (age-dependent)
YouTube to TikTok: 45-65% overlap
Social to Programmatic: 60-75% overlap
CTV to Social: 55-70% overlap

Implications:
- High overlap means likely over-frequency
- Low overlap means audience extension opportunity
- Adjust caps based on overlap percentages

CALCULATING DEDUPLICATED REACH

Simple Overlap Formula:
Deduplicated Reach = Reach A + Reach B - (Reach A x Reach B x Overlap %)

Example:
- Meta reach: 40% of target
- YouTube reach: 35% of target
- Overlap: 80%
- Deduplicated = 0.40 + 0.35 - (0.40 x 0.35 x 0.80) = 0.638 or 63.8%

Advanced Calculation:
For multiple channels, use sequential deduplication:
- Start with largest reach channel
- Add each channel minus overlap with prior channels
- Repeat until all channels included

Tools and Methodologies:
- Nielsen TAR (Total Ad Ratings)
- Comscore Campaign Ratings
- Platform-provided reach planners
- Third-party measurement solutions

OVERLAP-BASED BUDGET ALLOCATION

When overlap is high:
- Reduce combined budget to avoid waste
- Set lower frequency caps
- Consider reducing one platform
- Focus on reach extension channels

When overlap is low:
- Opportunity for incremental reach
- Can maintain higher individual caps
- Allocate more budget to extend reach
- Different audiences may need different messages

FREQUENCY DIAGNOSTICS
