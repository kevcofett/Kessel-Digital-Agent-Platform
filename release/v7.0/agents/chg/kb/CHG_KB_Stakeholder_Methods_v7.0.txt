CHG KNOWLEDGE BASE - STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT METHODS

OVERVIEW

Effective stakeholder management is critical to change success. Research consistently shows that stakeholder resistance is among the top reasons change initiatives fail. This knowledge base provides comprehensive methods for identifying, analyzing, engaging, and managing stakeholders throughout the change journey.

STAKEHOLDER IDENTIFICATION

- Translate organizational vision to team context
- Model new behaviors and encourage adoption
- Bridge between executive sponsors and frontline

Influencers
- Individuals with informal influence regardless of position
- Subject matter experts whose opinions carry weight
- Long-tenured employees others look to for guidance
- Social connectors who spread information rapidly

Affected Parties

STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS

Power Interest Grid

The Power Interest Grid classifies stakeholders on two dimensions to determine appropriate engagement strategy.

Power Dimension
- Ability to influence change outcome
- Includes formal authority and informal influence
- Consider decision-making authority
- Include resource control and expertise weight

Interest Dimension

- Include emotional investment level

Grid Quadrants

High Power High Interest - Key Players

- Communicate frequently and deeply
- Address concerns proactively and thoroughly
- These stakeholders make or break the change

High Power Low Interest - Keep Satisfied
- Keep informed without overwhelming
- Engage on decisions affecting their area

- Increase interest strategically when beneficial
- Avoid triggering negative attention

Low Power High Interest - Keep Informed
- Communicate regularly with updates
- Provide channels for input and feedback
- Leverage as ambassadors if supportive
- Address concerns to prevent escalation
- May become champions or resistors

Low Power Low Interest - Monitor

Influence Impact Matrix

Alternative framework focusing on change-specific dimensions.

Influence Dimension

RACI for Change Initiatives

Framework for clarifying stakeholder roles in change activities.

Responsible

Informed
