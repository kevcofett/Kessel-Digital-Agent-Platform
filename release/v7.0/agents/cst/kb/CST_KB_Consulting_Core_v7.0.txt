This document provides the core consulting methodology, engagement model, and behavioral guidance for the Consulting Strategy Agent. It establishes the systematic approach for strategic analysis and advisory services.

========================================

CONSULTING ENGAGEMENT MODEL

OVERVIEW

The consulting engagement model provides a structured approach for strategic advisory work. It ensures systematic progression from understanding the problem through delivering actionable recommendations.

PHASE 1 - DISCOVERY

Purpose

Discovery establishes the foundation for effective consulting engagement. The goal is to deeply understand the problem, context, stakeholders, and success criteria before diving into analysis.

Discovery Objectives

- Understand the business problem or opportunity driving the engagement
- Identify key stakeholders and their perspectives
- Define scope boundaries and constraints
- Establish success criteria and expected outcomes
- Build shared understanding with client

Discovery Activities

Stakeholder Identification

- Identify all parties affected by the problem or solution
- Map stakeholder interests, influence, and concerns
- Determine who needs to be consulted versus informed
- Identify decision makers and approval authorities

Problem Framing

- Articulate the problem in clear, specific terms
- Distinguish symptoms from root causes
- Understand why this problem matters now
- Explore previous attempts to address the problem

Scope Definition

- Define what is included and excluded from engagement
- Identify dependencies and adjacent topics
- Set geographic, organizational, or temporal boundaries
- Agree on level of depth and detail expected

Success Criteria Establishment

- Define what success looks like for the engagement
- Identify measurable outcomes where possible
- Understand how recommendations will be evaluated
- Set expectations for deliverables and timeline

Discovery Outputs

- Problem Statement - Clear articulation of the problem being addressed
- Stakeholder Map - Visual or tabular view of key stakeholders
- Scope Document - Boundaries and constraints documented
- Success Criteria - Measurable or observable outcomes defined

Discovery Best Practices

- Listen more than talk during stakeholder conversations
- Ask open-ended questions to surface context
- Challenge assumptions respectfully
- Document everything for future reference
- Confirm understanding before moving forward

PHASE 2 - ASSESSMENT

Purpose

Assessment establishes the factual foundation for recommendations. The goal is to objectively analyze current state, identify gaps, and synthesize findings.

Assessment Objectives

- Document current state accurately and objectively
- Identify gaps between current and desired state
- Gather supporting data and evidence
- Synthesize findings into coherent themes

Assessment Activities

Data Gathering

- Collect quantitative data where available
- Conduct qualitative research through interviews and observation
- Review existing documentation and prior work
- Benchmark against industry standards or best practices

Current State Documentation

- Document what exists today without judgment
- Identify strengths as well as weaknesses
- Note areas of uncertainty or missing information

Gap Analysis

- Compare current state to desired or benchmark state
- Quantify gaps where possible
- Assess severity and priority of gaps
- Identify root causes of significant gaps

Finding Synthesis

- Note resource requirements and risks
- Compare options systematically

Prioritization

- Rank options by overall evaluation
- Consider implementation sequence
- Identify quick wins versus strategic initiatives
- Balance short-term and long-term value

Recommendations Outputs

- Option Set - Complete list of options considered
- Evaluation Matrix - Options scored against criteria
- Prioritized Recommendations - Ranked list with rationale
- Trade-off Analysis - Documented pros, cons, risks

- Develop mitigation strategies
- Plan contingencies for major risks

Roadmap Outputs

- Implementation Roadmap - Phased timeline with milestones
- Resource Plan - People, skills, and budget requirements
- Risk Register - Risks with mitigation and contingency
- Governance Model - Decision making and oversight structure
- Roadmap Summary - Executive-ready implementation overview

Roadmap Best Practices

- Be realistic about timelines and capacity
- Build in contingency for uncertainty
- Define clear decision points between phases
- Plan for change management alongside implementation
- Identify success metrics for each phase
