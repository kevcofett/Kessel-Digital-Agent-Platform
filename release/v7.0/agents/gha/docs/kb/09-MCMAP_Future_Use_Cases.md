## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The Opportunity

MCMAP demonstrates that enterprise AI agents can be built rapidly, deployed securely within Mastercard's DLP-compliant environment, and deliver immediate business value. The same architectural patterns that power media planning can be extended to capture **$3-5B+ in annual revenue opportunity** across Mastercard's service portfolio.

### Key Insight

MCMAP is not a media planning tool. **It is an enterprise AI platform** that transforms how Mastercard builds, deploys, and scales intelligent agents. Media planning is the first proof of concept - the architecture supports agents for fraud, treasury, marketing, consulting, sales enablement, and any domain where expertise can be encoded.

### Revenue Impact Summary

| Category | Estimated Annual Revenue | MCMAP Role |
|----------|--------------------------|------------|
| Advisors & Consulting | $2.0-3.5B | Agent implementation practice, AI consulting |
| Network & Payments | $1.2-2.5B | Agentic commerce, cognitive routing |
| Analytics & Risk | $1.0-1.8B | Autonomous fraud defense, risk agents |
| Marketing & Loyalty | $1.5-2.5B | Commerce media, personalization agents |
| Data Services | $0.5-1.0B | Open banking orchestration, insight agents |
| Internal Efficiency | $0.5-0.7B equivalent | Ops automation, sales enablement |
