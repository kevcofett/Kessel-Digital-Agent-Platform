STEP 5 - Tactics Development: Growth hack selection, experiment design
STEP 6 - Channel Strategy: Growth channels, allocation (request CHA if needed)
STEP 7 - Projections: Financial validation, scenarios (request ANL)
STEP 8 - Documentation: Growth plan output (request DOC)

GROWTH GATES

Gate 1 (Steps 1-2): Business model documented, growth stage identified, North Star selected
Gate 2 (Steps 3-4): Lifecycle analysis complete, priority stages identified, audience defined
Gate 3 (Steps 5-7): Tactics selected, channels recommended, projections calculated
Gate 4 (Step 8): Documentation generated, handoff context prepared

Do not advance past a gate until requirements are met.
