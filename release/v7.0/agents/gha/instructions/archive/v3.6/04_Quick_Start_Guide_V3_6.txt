V3.6 QUICK START GUIDE
=======================
15-Minute Deployment to Full Operation

WHAT IS V3.6?
=============
Modular consulting agent with 29 enhancements
Core under 8K (5909 chars), unlimited scalability via modules
Production-grade stability, 30-85pct efficiency gains

DEPLOYMENT STEPS
================

STEP 1: DEPLOY CORE (2 minutes)
--------------------------------
Action: Copy 01_CoPilot_Core_Instructions_V3.6.txt to CoPilot custom instructions
Location: Settings - Custom Instructions - Paste
Verify: Character count 5909 (well under 8K limit)
Status: Core deployed

STEP 2: UPLOAD MODULES (3 minutes)
-----------------------------------
Upload to project files:
- 02_Stability_Enhancements_V3.6.txt
- 03_Enhancement_Modules_E_Q_U_P3_V3.6.txt

These auto-load when needed, no manual loading required

STEP 3: INITIAL TEST (5 minutes)
---------------------------------
Test 1: Start fresh session, verify P1-P2 load
Test 2: Type system health - should show all operational
Test 3: Type show loaded - should show Core plus P1-P2
Test 4: Type q - should auto-load Module U
Test 5: Type alternatives - should auto-load Module E
Test 6: Verify all auto-loading works

Success Criteria:
- Core under 8K: Yes
- P1-P2 load before interaction: Yes
- Modules auto-load on triggers: Yes
- All commands recognized: Yes
- STEP 0 works for new tasks: Yes
- Main Workflow runs every command: Yes

STEP 4: MONITOR (Ongoing)
--------------------------
Watch for:
- Module loading patterns
- Enhancement adoption rates
- Error recovery success rates
- User feedback

KEY COMMANDS
============
Core: start over | show decision log | what's my role? | show frameworks | optimize this prompt
Module Management: load stability|efficiency|quality|ux|power|all | show loaded
Stability: system health | diagnose | compress session
Efficiency: alternatives | estimate | auto-apply
Quality: check consistency | verify requirements | quality status
UX: q | undo | help | context | status | check quality | explain | pause | resume
Power: batch colon X,Y,Z | save template colon name | load template colon name

BENEFITS
========
Stability: 95pct auto-recovery, unlimited sessions, fault-tolerant
Efficiency: 70pct fewer questions, 3-5x longer sessions, 15-20pct faster
Quality: 60-70pct issues caught, sustained excellence
UX: 75pct time savings, risk-free experimentation

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============
Issue: Commands not recognized
Fix: Type show loaded, then load needed module

Issue: STEP 0 not triggering
Fix: Check P1 loaded, type system health

Issue: Module not loading
Fix: Type load module name manually

Issue: Context approaching limit
Fix: Type compress session or system handles automatically at 85pct
