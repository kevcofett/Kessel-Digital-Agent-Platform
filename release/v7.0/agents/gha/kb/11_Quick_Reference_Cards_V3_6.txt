CARD 9: ERROR HANDLING
======================

Document Loading Check (FIRST):
- P1 (Execution Engine) loaded? If No: CRITICAL
- P2 (AI Profile) loaded? If No: CRITICAL
- Modules available? If needed: Load

Module Loading Check:
- Are needed modules loaded?
- Can modules load successfully?
- Are there conflicts?

Auto-Recovery (Module S):
If Module S loaded:
- Attempt 1: Reload P1-P2
- Attempt 2: Reset workflow state
- Attempt 3: Full system reset
- If all fail: Surface to user with manual fix

Health Check (Module S):
- Runs automatically every 25 commands
- Verifies: P1-P2 loaded, STEP 0 defined, Workflow operational, Commands recognized
- Manual trigger: system health command

Troubleshooting:
- Commands not recognized: Type show loaded then load needed module
- STEP 0 not triggering: Check P1 loaded, type system health
- Module not loading: Type load module name manually
- Context approaching limit: Type compress session (or auto at 85pct)

CARD 10: EFFICIENCY TIPS
=========================

Save Time:
- Use q for Quick Mode (75pct time savings)
- Enable smart defaults
- Create presets for common tasks
- Use batch processing for multiple items
- Load framework packs proactively

Optimize Workflows:
- Save templates for repetitive work
- Use alternatives command for options
- Enable framework auto-select
- Set default preferences
- Use undo for quick corrections

Extend Sessions:
- Let context compression auto-trigger at 85pct
- Manually compress at 60pct for long sessions
- Use pause resume for multi-session work
- Unload unused framework packs

Improve Quality:
- Enable all quality checks (Module Q)
- Use consistency checking
- Verify requirements before delivery
- Run quality pre-checks early
- Monitor quality regression

Power User Techniques:
- Master keyboard commands
