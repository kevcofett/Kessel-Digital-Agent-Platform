######################
# SECTION 1: ACQUISITION
######################

CASE: Nubank (Brazil)
Audience: Millennials, Gen Z, unbanked and early credit users
What worked:
- Viral waiting list with gamified referral: Nubank’s early waitlist grew virally by rewarding users who invited friends with a faster place in line, generating massive organic demand.
- “Purple Card” branding: Created a status symbol out of the card itself, leading to organic Instagram and TikTok content.
- Invite-only during early years: Artificial scarcity created FOMO, even when eligibility was broad.

CASE: Inter (Brazil)
Audience: Salaried workers, middle class, freelancer segments
What worked:
- “Fee-free everything” hook: Inter positioned themselves as the anti-bank, highlighting 0 fees across all digital channels, driving curiosity and virality.
- Salary portability: Users could unlock credit lines instantly by transferring their payroll to Inter — a Trojan horse move to capture long-term behavior.
- Heavy investment in influencer-backed YouTube campaigns with creators who explained banking “secrets.”

CASE: Capital One (US)
Audience: Low-credit or building-credit customers
What worked:
- Pre-approval funnel with zero impact on score: A/B tested onboarding showed a massive lift in conversions when using soft checks, especially when combined with “You're approved” CTA wording before the full application.
