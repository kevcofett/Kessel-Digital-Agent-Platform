ENHANCEMENT REQUEST LOG V3.6
Operational Guide for Consultants
================================================================================

PURPOSE OF THIS GUIDE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This guide shows you how to:
o Submit enhancement requests to improve the system
o Check the status of your requests
o Understand what happens after you submit
o Get help when your request needs more information
o Know when to expect updates

This is a practical guide for daily use - not comprehensive documentation.


================================================================================
SECTION 1: HOW TO SUBMIT A REQUEST
================================================================================

QUICK START - 3 SIMPLE STEPS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Pick the right request type (see Section 2)
2. Fill out the basic information (see templates below)
3. Send to your System Administrator or designated contact

That's it! You'll get a confirmation with a Request ID for tracking.


WHAT INFORMATION TO PROVIDE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every request needs these basics:

? Your Name/Role
? Date of submission
? What you're requesting (clear description)
? Why it's needed (business reason)
? How urgent it is (see priority guide below)

Optional but helpful:
o Examples or screenshots
o Which parts of the system are affected
o Ideas for how to implement it


PRIORITY GUIDE - HOW URGENT IS IT?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

P0 - CRITICAL (Get help immediately!)
-> System is broken or security issue
-> Example: "The execution engine won't load any frameworks"
-> Response time: Within 24 hours

P1 - HIGH (Important, need it soon)
-> Major feature missing or significant problem
-> Example: "Need a new industry framework for automotive sector"
-> Response time: Within 1 week

P2 - MEDIUM (Would be nice to have)
-> Improvements or non-critical enhancements
-> Example: "Add more examples to the Quick Reference guide"
-> Response time: Within 1 month

P3 - LOW (Future improvement)
-> Minor improvements or ideas for later
-> Example: "Consider adding color coding to status reports"
-> Response time: When convenient


================================================================================
SECTION 2: COMMON REQUEST TYPES
================================================================================

TYPE 1: BUG REPORT - "Something's Not Working"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use when: Something that should work doesn't work correctly

What to include:
o What's broken (clear description)
o What you expected to happen
o What actually happened
o Steps to recreate the problem (1, 2, 3...)

Example: "The Financial Services framework template is missing the ROI 
calculator section. When I select Framework 3, I should see 8 sections but 
only 7 appear. This happens every time I load it."


TYPE 2: FEATURE REQUEST - "Can We Add This?"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use when: You need new functionality that doesn't exist

What to include:
o What you want added
o Why it would be valuable
o Who would benefit from it

Example: "Can we add a Healthcare industry framework? We're getting more 
healthcare clients and need standardized analysis templates. Would benefit 
the entire consulting team (8 people) and help us close deals faster."


TYPE 3: ENHANCEMENT - "Can We Make This Better?"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use when: Something exists but could work better

What to include:
o What needs improvement
o Why the current version is insufficient
o How making it better would help your work

Example: "The Gap Correction checklist is too long - takes 45 minutes to 
complete. Can we streamline it to focus on critical items only? Would save 
2-3 hours per week across the team."


TYPE 4: DOCUMENTATION - "The Instructions Aren't Clear"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use when: You need better instructions or examples

What to include:
o What documentation is unclear
o What you tried to do and couldn't figure out
o What kind of help would make it clearer

Example: "The Onboarding guide doesn't explain how to change your user role. 
I couldn't find instructions on requesting role advancement. Need a simple 
how-to section."


TYPE 5: NEW FRAMEWORK - "We Need a Framework For..."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use when: You need a new strategic framework or analysis template

What to include:
o What industry or topic it covers
o What strategic questions it should answer
o Why existing frameworks don't cover this need

Example: "Need a Supply Chain Optimization framework for retail clients. 
Should cover inventory management, distribution efficiency, and cost analysis. 
Current frameworks don't address this and we have 3 projects needing it."

================================================================================
SECTION 5: WHAT HAPPENS AFTER YOU SUBMIT
================================================================================

THE REQUEST LIFECYCLE (Simple Version)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STEP 1: SUBMISSION
You submit -> Get confirmation -> Receive Request ID

STEP 2: TRIAGE (Within 48 hours)
System Admin reviews -> Assigns priority -> Categorizes request

STEP 3: REVIEW (Varies by priority)
Detailed evaluation -> Feasibility check -> Impact assessment

STEP 4: DECISION
Approved -> Move to implementation
Rejected -> Get explanation
Deferred -> Schedule for later
Needs Info -> Contact you for details

STEP 5: IMPLEMENTATION (If approved)
Development -> Testing -> Documentation

STEP 6: VALIDATION
Quality check -> User testing (maybe you) -> Final verification

STEP 7: COMPLETION
Deploy/release -> Update documentation -> Close request -> Notify you


WHEN YOU'LL HEAR UPDATES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update frequency depends on priority:

P0 (Critical): Real-time updates (immediate notifications)
P1 (High): Weekly updates
P2 (Medium): Every 2 weeks
P3 (Low): Monthly updates

You'll always be notified when:
o Status changes significantly
o Request is approved or rejected
o Implementation is complete
o Action is needed from you


================================================================================
SECTION 6: TROUBLESHOOTING & COMMON ISSUES
================================================================================

ISSUE: "My request was rejected"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why this happens:
o Request is outside system scope
o Not technically feasible
o Duplicate of existing request
o Better solution already exists
o Insufficient business justification

What to do:
1. Read the rejection explanation carefully
2. If you disagree, ask for clarification
3. If justified, submit revised request addressing concerns
4. Consider if alternative solutions would work


ISSUE: "I need more information but don't know what"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why this happens:
o Request description was unclear
o Missing critical details
o Need specific examples
o Impact wasn't clear

What to do:
1. Contact reviewer directly - ask specifically what's needed
2. Provide concrete examples
3. Add screenshots or documentation references
4. Clarify business impact and urgency


ISSUE: "My request is taking forever"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why this happens:
o Lower priority (P2/P3 take longer)
o Complex implementation
o Waiting on dependencies
o Resource constraints
o Request on hold due to blockers

What to do:
1. Check the status - look for blockers or dependencies
2. Ask System Admin for estimated timeline
3. If truly urgent, make case for priority increase
4. Be patient if it's appropriate P3 priority


ISSUE: "I submitted but never got a Request ID"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why this happens:
o Submission didn't reach administrator
o Email/message lost
o Submitted to wrong person
o System error

What to do:
1. Verify you sent to correct contact
2. Check sent messages/emails for confirmation
3. Resubmit if no response within 72 hours
4. Contact System Admin directly to confirm receipt


ISSUE: "Status hasn't updated in weeks"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why this happens:
o Status updates less frequent for P2/P3
o Request on hold (may not be visible)
o Working on complex implementation
o Waiting for related dependencies

What to do:
1. Check expected update frequency for your priority
2. If past expected update, contact System Admin
3. Ask for current status and estimated completion
4. Verify request wasn't inadvertently closed


ISSUE: "Implementation doesn't match what I requested"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why this happens:
o Miscommunication during review
o Technical constraints required changes
o Better solution identified during development
o Request evolved during implementation

What to do:
1. Provide specific feedback during validation phase
2. Explain what's different and why it matters
3. Work with implementation team on adjustments
4. Consider submitting enhancement request for gaps


================================================================================
SECTION 7: BEST PRACTICES FOR BETTER REQUESTS
================================================================================

DO THIS (Increases approval chances)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
? Be specific and detailed in descriptions
? Explain clear business value
? Provide concrete examples
? Identify affected users/teams
? Suggest priority with reasoning
? Include screenshots if relevant
? Respond quickly when asked for info
? Test thoroughly during validation

DON'T DO THIS (Decreases approval chances)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
? Vague descriptions like "make it better"
? No business justification
? Everything marked as P0/P1 when it's not
? Submitting duplicate requests
? Ignoring requests for clarification
? Expecting instant results for P3 items
? Demanding specific implementation approach
? Skipping validation phase


WRITING GOOD DESCRIPTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bad: "The system is slow"
Good: "The Financial Services Framework takes 15+ seconds to load, causing 
      delays during client presentations. Need faster load time."

Bad: "Need better reports"
Good: "Need export functionality to save analysis results as PDF. Currently 
      can only view on screen, clients want takeaway documents."

Bad: "Fix the bug"
Good: "When selecting 'Retail Industry' from dropdown, system shows error 
      message 'Framework not found.' Started happening after 11/15 update."


EXPLAINING BUSINESS VALUE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bad: "Would be cool to have"
Good: "Would save 3 hours per project by automating data entry. Team completes 
      12 projects/month = 36 hours saved monthly."

Bad: "Everyone wants this"
Good: "Requested by 5 clients in last month. Required for competitive parity 
      with other consulting firms. Risk losing business without it."

Bad: "It's broken"
Good: "Blocks completion of client deliverables. Currently costing 2-3 day 
      delays per project while we work around the issue manually."

================================================================================
SECTION 9: EXAMPLES OF GOOD REQUESTS
================================================================================

EXAMPLE 1: GOOD BUG REPORT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENHANCEMENT REQUEST - BUG REPORT

Submitted by: Sarah Chen, Advanced User
Date: 2025-12-01
Request type: BUG
Priority: P1
Request ID: [Will be assigned]

WHAT'S BROKEN:
The Retail Industry Framework (Framework 8) is missing the "Competitive 
Analysis" section. This section is mentioned in the Quick Reference guide 
but doesn't appear when I load the framework.

WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN:
When I select Framework 8, I should see 10 sections including "Competitive 
Analysis" as the 6th section.

WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS:
Only 9 sections appear. The framework jumps from "Market Analysis" (section 5) 
directly to "Financial Projections" (section 7). Section 6 is completely missing.

HOW TO RECREATE:
1. Load Prompt Execution Engine
2. Select "Framework 8 - Retail Industry Analysis"
3. View section list
4. Notice missing section 6

IMPACT:
Severity: High
Who's affected: All users working with retail clients (6 consultants)
Workaround: Manually adding competitive analysis section, adds 30 min/project

VERSION INFO: Framework Library V3.0

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


EXAMPLE 2: GOOD FEATURE REQUEST
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENHANCEMENT REQUEST - FEATURE REQUEST

Submitted by: Marcus Johnson, Expert User
Date: 2025-12-01
Request type: FEATURE
Priority: P1
Request ID: [Will be assigned]

WHAT I NEED:
Ability to export completed analyses as PDF with client branding (logo, colors, 
footer). Currently can only view on screen or copy text.

WHY I NEED IT:
Clients expect professional deliverables they can share internally. Manual 
reformatting in Word takes 2-3 hours per project. We deliver 15 projects/month 
= 30-45 hours of wasted time.

WHO BENEFITS:
All consultants delivering client-facing work (12 people)
Clients receive professional branded documents
Management has better deliverable consistency

AFFECTED AREAS:
[X] Execution Engine (needs export function)
[X] Templates (need branding templates)
[ ] Aragorn AI Profile
[ ] Frameworks
[ ] User Preferences
[ ] Documentation

HOW TO MEASURE SUCCESS:
o Export function available in Engine menu
o Can apply client branding template
o Generates PDF in under 30 seconds
o Reduces deliverable prep time by 80%

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:
Competitive firms offer this feature. We've lost 2 opportunities where clients 
specifically asked about branded deliverable capability. High ROI - saves 360+ 
hours annually across team.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


EXAMPLE 3: GOOD ENHANCEMENT REQUEST
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENHANCEMENT REQUEST - ENHANCEMENT

Submitted by: Jennifer Lopez, Standard User
Date: 2025-12-01
Request type: ENHANCEMENT
Priority: P2
Request ID: [Will be assigned]

WHAT I NEED:
Streamline the User Preferences questionnaire from 25 questions to 10-12 
essential questions. Many current questions seem redundant or rarely impact 
system behavior.

WHY I NEED IT:
New users spend 45+ minutes on initial setup, which feels excessive. Several 
questions ask similar things (e.g., communication style asked 3 different ways). 
Shorter setup improves onboarding experience and reduces setup abandonment.

WHO BENEFITS:
New users (easier onboarding)
Administrators (fewer setup support requests)

AFFECTED AREAS:
[X] User Preferences Guide
[X] Onboarding System
[ ] Aragorn AI Profile
[ ] Execution Engine
[ ] Frameworks
[ ] Templates

HOW TO MEASURE SUCCESS:
o Setup time reduced from 45 min to 15-20 min
o Maintains same or better preference accuracy
o Fewer support tickets about setup process
o Higher completion rate for initial setup

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:
Tracked 8 new user setups - average 47 minutes, 3 users needed help, 2 
abandoned and restarted later. Post-setup survey showed confusion about 
question redundancy. Propose: keep 10 highest-impact questions, combine 
similar questions, move advanced options to optional section.
