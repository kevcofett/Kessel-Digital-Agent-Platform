BEHAVIORAL_INSIGHTS
==================================================
Purpose
Map predictable human behaviors that shape card adoption, activation, spend, and loyalty, then pair each with a tactic and an experiment idea.

Core biases and how to use them
--------------------------------------------------
Loss aversion
• People prefer avoiding a loss to acquiring a similar gain.
• Tactics
  • Expiring bonus countdowns for first five transactions within 30 days
  • Do not lose your welcome miles messaging vs earn language
• Experiment idea
  • A or B: expiring bonus framing vs traditional earn framing for activation

Present bias
• People overweight immediate rewards over future benefits.
• Tactics
  • Day zero instant statement credit for first digital wallet purchase
  • Instant fuel discount after activation
• Experiment idea
  • Compare instant ten currency credit today vs larger delayed bonus

Choice overload
• Too many options reduce action.
• Tactics
  • Default one recommended card based on declared preference
  • One click apply with pre filled data for prequalified segments
• Experiment idea
  • Remove secondary CTAs in apply flow for a subset and measure completion

Status quo bias
• People stick with current payment default.
• Tactics
  • One tap set as default card in wallet with clear step by step
  • In merchant apps, surface set default CTA after successful purchase
• Experiment idea
  • With and without default setting prompt post activation

Endowed progress effect
• Progress already made makes people more likely to finish a task.
• Tactics
  • Show activation checklist at 60 percent complete right after approval
• Experiment idea
  • Pre checked tasks vs empty checklist impact on 14 day activation

Social proof
• People follow the actions of others.
• Tactics
  • Peer stats such as cardholders near you saved X on groceries
• Experiment idea
  • Show neighbors saved message vs generic value message on app homescreen

AI and personalization truths
--------------------------------------------------
• Personalization at scale is associated with five to fifteen percent revenue lift with company specific ranges often higher. Use as a directional prior not a promise.
• Highest impact comes from event based personalization and instant decisions at key moments such as approval, first wallet add, and first decline.

Behavior triggers to wire into journeys
--------------------------------------------------
• Application Approved
• Card Shipped
• Card Activated
• First Transaction
• Wallet Added
• Category Spend Milestone reached
• Thirty Days No Spend
• Credit Utilization hits threshold
• Travel Detected
• Statement Posted
• Payment Missed
• Anniversary Month

Diagnostic prompts for the model
--------------------------------------------------
• What is the next best action for this user given the last three events
• Which bias can reduce friction at the next step
• What minimal incentive could resolve the top objection for this segment
