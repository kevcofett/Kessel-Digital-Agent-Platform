GHA LEARNING EXTRACTION v7.0
VERSION: 7.0
STATUS: Production Ready
COMPLIANCE: KDAP v7.0 Agent Standard

------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE

GHA implements self-referential learning to continuously improve growth recommendations. When analysis reveals validated insights that meet promotion criteria, GHA documents findings and coordinates with ANL and PRF to integrate learnings into the platform knowledge base.

------------------------------------------------------------

LEARNING CAPTURE PROCESS

STEP 1 - IDENTIFY INSIGHT

During growth analysis, identify findings that:
- Show measurable impact on lifecycle metrics
- Reveal patterns across multiple experiments or campaigns
- Contradict or extend existing KB content
- Provide actionable optimization opportunities

STEP 2 - DOCUMENT FINDING

Record insight with full context:
- Lifecycle stage affected
- Metric impacted and magnitude
- Sample size and statistical confidence
- Time period and conditions observed
- Data source and methodology

STEP 3 - VALIDATE SIGNIFICANCE

Request ANL validation of learning significance:
- Statistical significance test results
- Confidence interval for impact estimate
- Sample size adequacy assessment
- Generalizability evaluation

STEP 4 - EVALUATE PROMOTION CRITERIA

Check if insight meets all promotion criteria before requesting KB integration

STEP 5 - REQUEST PROMOTION

If criteria met, request PRF to add learning to platform learning loop
Provide complete documentation package for review

------------------------------------------------------------

PROMOTION CRITERIA

All criteria must be met for KB promotion:

IMPACT THRESHOLD

- Greater than 10 percent improvement in target lifecycle metric
- Statistically significant at 95 percent confidence level
- Impact sustained over minimum 2 week observation period

VALIDATION REQUIREMENT

- Validated across 2 or more independent experiment cycles
- Confirmed by ANL statistical analysis
- No conflicting evidence in subsequent tests

STATISTICAL SUPPORT

- Sample size meets minimum power requirements
- Confidence intervals appropriately bounded
- Methodology documented and reproducible

GENERALIZABILITY

- Applicable beyond single vertical or product category
- Not dependent on unique market conditions
- Transferable pattern, not one-time anomaly

------------------------------------------------------------

LEARNING CATEGORIES

TACTIC EFFECTIVENESS

Learnings about which growth tactics perform best:
- Tactic performance by lifecycle stage
- ICE score validation against actual results
- Tactic sequencing and combination effects
- Diminishing returns thresholds

Target KB: GHA_KB_Campaign_Patterns, GHA_KB_Frameworks

CHANNEL PERFORMANCE

Learnings about acquisition and engagement channels:
- Channel performance by audience segment
- Cross-channel attribution findings
- Channel saturation indicators
- Emerging channel opportunities

Target KB: GHA_KB_Growth_Channels, CHA_KB files

BEHAVIORAL TRIGGER EFFECTIVENESS

Learnings about psychological drivers:
- Hook Model trigger performance
- Fogg Model application results
- Cognitive bias effectiveness by context
- Retention intervention timing

Target KB: GHA_KB_Behavioral_Psychology

REFERRAL PROGRAM PATTERNS

Learnings about viral mechanics:
- Referral program conversion patterns
- Viral coefficient optimization factors
- Incentive structure effectiveness
- Network effect acceleration

Target KB: GHA_KB_Growth_Architecture

RETENTION INTERVENTION TIMING

Learnings about when to intervene:
- Optimal intervention windows by lifecycle stage
- Churn prediction signal timing
- Re-engagement cadence effectiveness
- Win-back campaign timing

Target KB: GHA_KB_Growth_Workflows

------------------------------------------------------------

FEEDBACK LOOP PROCESS

INTERNAL LOOP

Within GHA session:
- Apply recent learnings to current recommendations
- Track recommendation outcomes during session
- Adjust confidence levels based on validation status

SPECIALIST LOOP

Coordinate with other agents:
- Request ANL validation of statistical significance
- Request AUD confirmation of segment applicability
- Request CHA validation of channel patterns

PLATFORM LOOP

Promote to platform knowledge:
- Request PRF to evaluate learning for platform integration
- Provide complete documentation package
- Track promotion decision and rationale

------------------------------------------------------------

LEARNING DOCUMENTATION FORMAT

TITLE

Clear descriptive title for the learning

LIFECYCLE STAGE

Which AARRR stage this learning applies to

FINDING

Concise statement of the validated insight

IMPACT METRICS

Quantified impact with confidence intervals

SUPPORTING DATA

Sample size, time period, methodology

VALIDATION STATUS

ANL validation results and confidence level

GENERALIZABILITY ASSESSMENT

Scope of applicability and limitations

RECOMMENDED ACTION

How to apply this learning in future analyses

------------------------------------------------------------

ANTI-PATTERNS

Do not promote learnings that:
- Are based on single data point or anecdote
- Have not been validated by ANL
- Apply only to specific client or unique situation
- Contradict well-established principles without strong evidence
- Lack reproducible methodology

------------------------------------------------------------

LEARNING QUALITY HIERARCHY

TIER 1 - VALIDATED PLATFORM LEARNING

Meets all promotion criteria
Integrated into platform KB
Highest confidence in recommendations

TIER 2 - VALIDATED SESSION LEARNING

Meets validation but not generalizability
Apply within current engagement only
Medium confidence

TIER 3 - OBSERVED PATTERN

Identified but not yet validated
Flag for future validation
Low confidence - disclose limitation

TIER 4 - HYPOTHESIS

Theoretical pattern worth testing
Design experiment to validate
Very low confidence - frame as hypothesis
