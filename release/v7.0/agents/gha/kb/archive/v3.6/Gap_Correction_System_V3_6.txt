GAP CORRECTION SYSTEM V3.6
Operational Guide for Consultants
================================================================================

PURPOSE OF THIS GUIDE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This guide shows you how to:
o Report issues, bugs, and problems you find
o Understand what happens after you report
o Check the status of your reported issues
o Get help when something's not working
o Know when to escalate problems

This is a practical guide for daily use - not comprehensive documentation.


================================================================================
SECTION 1: WHAT IS A "GAP" OR "ISSUE"?
================================================================================

SIMPLE DEFINITION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A gap or issue is anything that's:
o Broken (doesn't work)
o Missing (should exist but doesn't)
o Wrong (information is incorrect)
o Confusing (documentation unclear)
o Inconsistent (contradicts something else)

If you notice something that makes work harder or doesn't seem right,
that's probably a gap worth reporting.


COMMON TYPES OF GAPS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TYPE 1: SOMETHING'S BROKEN ?
What it looks like:
o Feature doesn't work when you try to use it
o Error messages appear unexpectedly
o System crashes or freezes
o Links don't work
o Commands fail

Examples:
o "Framework 5 won't load - shows error message"
o "Export function produces blank document"
o "System times out when I try to save"

-> REPORT AS: Bug/System Issue


TYPE 2: SOMETHING'S MISSING ?
What it looks like:
o Feature mentioned in docs but doesn't exist
o Template section you need isn't there
o Documentation doesn't cover a topic
o Help for a function is absent

Examples:
o "Quick Reference says I can export to PDF but I don't see that option"
o "Tutorial mentions advanced settings but they're not in my menu"
o "Framework 8 is missing the financial analysis section"

-> REPORT AS: Missing Feature/Incomplete


TYPE 3: INFORMATION IS WRONG ?
What it looks like:
o Documentation describes feature incorrectly
o Instructions don't match what actually happens
o Examples show wrong output
o Cross-references point to wrong places

Examples:
o "Guide says click 'File' but the menu is actually 'Options'"
o "Framework description says 10 sections but only 8 appear"
o "Quick Reference shows old command syntax"

-> REPORT AS: Documentation Error


TYPE 4: SOMETHING'S CONFUSING ?
What it looks like:
o Instructions are unclear
o You can't figure out how to do something
o Multiple users ask same questions
o Documentation assumes knowledge you don't have

Examples:
o "I can't understand how to customize templates - instructions unclear"
o "What does 'Apply Framework Context' mean? Not explained"
o "Three different docs explain the same thing differently"

-> REPORT AS: Documentation Gap/Clarity Issue


TYPE 5: THINGS DON'T MATCH ?
What it looks like:
o One document says one thing, another says something else
o Terminology varies across documents
o Workflows described differently in different places
o Version numbers don't align

Examples:
o "User Guide says I need Admin role, but Quick Reference says Expert role"
o "One doc calls it 'execution mode', another calls it 'framework mode'"
o "Document says V3.0 but references V2.1 features"

-> REPORT AS: Inconsistency


================================================================================
SECTION 2: HOW TO REPORT ISSUES
================================================================================

QUICK REPORTING PROCESS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STEP 1: Confirm it's actually an issue
o Try the action again (was it a one-time glitch?)
o Check if you followed instructions correctly
o Ask yourself: "Is this a real problem or user error?"
o If unsure, ask a colleague or check documentation

STEP 2: Gather information
Before reporting, have ready:
? What you were trying to do
? What you expected to happen
? What actually happened
? Any error messages (exact text)
? Which document/framework/feature
? Your user role

STEP 3: Choose reporting method
o Quick issues -> Use simple reporting (see below)
o Complex issues -> Use detailed reporting (see below)
o Critical broken features -> Report immediately to admin

STEP 4: Submit your report
o Use the template that fits (Section 3)
o Provide all requested information
o Be specific and clear
o Include examples if helpful

STEP 5: Save your report ID
o You'll receive a tracking ID (like GAP-2025-042)
o Save this for checking status later


WHEN TO REPORT VS. WHEN TO ASK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REPORT AS GAP/ISSUE:
? Something definitely broken
? Documentation clearly wrong
? Missing expected feature
? Consistent problem (happens every time)
? Affects work quality or ability

ASK FOR HELP FIRST:
o Not sure if it's broken or you're doing it wrong
o Might be a training issue
o Only happened once
o Could be normal behavior you don't understand

-> Check Quick_Reference_Cards_V3_0.md
-> Review relevant operational guide
-> Ask colleague or mentor
-> Contact administrator for clarification

Then if confirmed as issue -> REPORT IT


WHERE TO REPORT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

METHOD 1: Contact System Administrator
o Email, message, or direct contact
o Include all information from Section 3 template
o State severity (how much it impacts you)
o Best for: Most issues

METHOD 2: Submit via Enhancement Request System
o Use Enhancement_Request_Log_V3.6.txt process
o Select "Bug Report" or "Documentation" category
o Follow submission templates
o Best for: Formal tracking needed

METHOD 3: Use Gap Report Form (if available)
o Fill out provided gap reporting form
o Submit through designated channel
o Receive automatic tracking ID
o Best for: Standardized environments

CHECK WITH YOUR ADMINISTRATOR:
Ask: "What's the preferred method for reporting issues?"
They'll tell you the process for your environment.

================================================================================
SECTION 6: BASIC TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

BEFORE REPORTING: TRY THESE FIRST
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ISSUE: Feature not working
TRY:
[ ] Refresh/reload the system
[ ] Log out and log back in
[ ] Clear cache (if web-based)
[ ] Try different browser (if web-based)
[ ] Check if system is under maintenance
[ ] Verify you have permission for that feature (check role)
[ ] Review Quick Reference Cards for correct procedure

Still broken after all this? -> REPORT IT


ISSUE: Can't find something
TRY:
[ ] Search in documentation
[ ] Check Table of Contents
[ ] Review Quick Reference Cards
[ ] Ask colleague if they know where it is
[ ] Check if your role has access (User_Role_System_V3.6.txt)
[ ] Verify document version you're looking at

Still can't find it? -> REPORT AS MISSING or UNCLEAR


ISSUE: Instructions don't make sense
TRY:
[ ] Read section again slowly
[ ] Look for examples in same document
[ ] Check related documents for clarification
[ ] Try the steps literally as written
[ ] Ask colleague to read and explain
[ ] Check if doc is for your role level

Still confused? -> REPORT AS CLARITY ISSUE


ISSUE: Different docs say different things
TRY:
[ ] Check version numbers (maybe one is outdated)
[ ] Check last updated dates
[ ] See which is more recent (likely more accurate)
[ ] Check Version Registry if available
[ ] Ask administrator which is correct

Still contradictory? -> REPORT AS INCONSISTENCY


ISSUE: Error message appears
TRY:
[ ] Read error message carefully (often tells you the problem)
[ ] Copy exact error text
[ ] Search for error text in documentation
[ ] Try operation again (might be temporary)
[ ] Check if input was correct format
[ ] Verify prerequisites were met

Still getting error? -> REPORT WITH EXACT ERROR TEXT


COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM: "I don't have permission for this feature"
SOLUTION:
o Check your role level (User_Role_System_V3.6.txt)
o Feature might require higher role
o If you should have access -> REPORT as permission issue
o If need advancement -> See User_Role_System for advancement process

PROBLEM: "Document says V3.0 but references V2.1 features"
SOLUTION:
o Likely documentation not fully updated
o Use V3.0 information where available
o REPORT as inconsistency with both references
o Administrator will clean up versioning

PROBLEM: "Link in document doesn't work"
SOLUTION:
o Check if you typed URL correctly (if manual)
o Check if referenced document exists in your environment
o Try alternative access method
o REPORT as broken link with both source and target documents

PROBLEM: "Instructions skip steps"
SOLUTION:
o Check if steps are in different section/document
o See if your role has access to skipped steps
o Ask colleague if they know missing steps
o REPORT as incomplete instructions with specific location

PROBLEM: "Can't tell which framework to use"
SOLUTION:
o Review Framework_Library_System_V3_0.md
o Check Prompt_Template_Library_V3_0.md decision guide
o Ask Advanced/Expert user for recommendation
o If still unclear -> REPORT as documentation gap


================================================================================
SECTION 7: WHEN TO ESCALATE
================================================================================

NORMAL VS. ESCALATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NORMAL REPORTING (Most issues):
o Follow standard reporting process (Section 2)
o Wait for normal review timeframes
o Respond to requests for information
o Be patient with resolution process

ESCALATE WHEN:
o Critical issue blocking all work
o Safety or security concern
o Data loss occurring
o Issue marked high priority but no response past deadline
o Fix deployed but doesn't work
o Urgent client deliverable impacted


HOW TO ESCALATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STEP 1: Verify escalation is needed
Ask yourself:
o Is this truly urgent or just important?
o Have I waited appropriate time for priority level?
o Is work completely blocked or just slowed?
o Are others also affected?

STEP 2: Document the urgency
Prepare:
o Original issue tracking ID
o Why escalation is needed (business impact)
o Who/what is affected
o Deadline or time sensitivity
o What you've tried already

STEP 3: Contact appropriate person
First: Your System Administrator (explain urgency)
If needed: Their manager or senior leadership
Last resort: Emergency contact (for critical systems)

STEP 4: Follow up
o Don't assume escalation was received
o Confirm someone is addressing urgently
o Ask for realistic timeline
o Get updates more frequently


ESCALATION TEMPLATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ESCALATION REQUEST

Original Issue ID: GAP-2025-XXX
Reported on: [Date]
Current status: [Last known status]
Priority assigned: [Current priority]

WHY ESCALATING:
[Explain business impact and urgency]

WHO'S AFFECTED:
[Team, clients, deliverables impacted]

TIME SENSITIVITY:
[Deadline, urgency reason]

WHAT'S BEEN TRIED:
[Actions taken, workarounds attempted]

REQUESTING:
[What you need - faster review, higher priority, specific action]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


WHEN NOT TO ESCALATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DON'T ESCALATE IF:
? Within normal response timeframe for priority
? Workaround available and working
? Issue is minor or cosmetic
? Just want faster service (not actual urgency)
? Didn't try basic troubleshooting first
? Haven't provided requested information

Why not: Escalations should be rare and truly urgent.
Frequent unnecessary escalations reduce effectiveness when really needed.


================================================================================
SECTION 8: TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON SITUATIONS
================================================================================

SITUATION: "I reported but never heard back"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POSSIBLE REASONS:
o Report didn't reach administrator (submission issue)
o Marked as duplicate (linked to another issue)
o Marked as not-an-issue (closed immediately)
o Lost in backlog (low priority)

WHAT TO DO:
1. Verify you have tracking ID (if not, never received)
2. Contact administrator: "Did you receive GAP-2025-XXX?"
3. If no record, resubmit with all information
4. Ask for confirmation of receipt


SITUATION: "Issue was marked 'not an issue' but I disagree"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POSSIBLE REASONS:
o Misunderstanding in communication
o Expected behavior you didn't understand
o Administrator saw different information
o Different interpretation of requirements

WHAT TO DO:
1. Read closure explanation carefully
2. If you understand now, accept closure
3. If you still disagree:
   o Reply with clarification
   o Provide additional evidence
   o Request reconsideration
   o Be respectful and professional


SITUATION: "Fix was deployed but doesn't work for me"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POSSIBLE REASONS:
o Need to refresh/restart
o Your environment different than test
o Partial fix (more work needed)
o Different issue than reported

WHAT TO DO:
1. Try standard troubleshooting (Section 6)
2. Reopen original issue: "Fix deployed but still seeing problem"
3. Provide specific details of remaining problem
4. May be new/different issue requiring separate report


SITUATION: "My issue is P3 but I need it sooner"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UNDERSTAND:
o Priority reflects system-wide impact, not personal urgency
o Your urgent ? system critical
o Resources allocated by impact and priority

OPTIONS:
1. Request priority review: Explain business impact
2. Find workaround to reduce urgency
3. Submit enhancement request for feature addition
4. Accept timeline and plan work around it
5. Discuss with management if truly business-critical


SITUATION: "Multiple people reporting same issue"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THIS IS HELPFUL DATA:
o Confirms issue is real
o Shows widespread impact
o May increase priority

WHAT TO DO:
1. Check if issue already reported (avoid duplicates)
2. If not, report with note: "Multiple users experiencing this"
3. If already reported, add your experience to existing issue
4. Don't submit 10 separate reports for same problem


================================================================================
SECTION 9: BEST PRACTICES
================================================================================

DO THESE THINGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
? Report issues promptly when you find them
? Provide specific, detailed information
? Include steps to recreate the problem
? Copy exact error messages
? Be patient with resolution timeline
? Respond quickly if more info requested
? Test and confirm when fix deployed
? Thank people who fix issues
? Help others by reporting problems you discover

DON'T DO THESE THINGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
? Wait to report until it's really bad
? Give vague descriptions "something's wrong"
? Skip troubleshooting steps
? Demand immediate fixes for P3 issues
? Ignore requests for more information
? Submit duplicate reports
? Expect fixes overnight
? Close issues before verifying fix works
? Complain without providing constructive feedback


WRITING GOOD ISSUE REPORTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BAD: "It's broken"
GOOD: "Framework 5 export function produces blank PDF. Expected populated 
      document with analysis results. Happens every time I try to export."

BAD: "Docs are wrong"
GOOD: "Quick Reference p.3 says click 'File->Export' but actual menu is 
      'Options->Export'. Screenshot attached. Version V3.0 dated 2025-11-28."

BAD: "Missing stuff"
GOOD: "User Guide V3.0 Section 4.2 references 'Advanced Settings menu' but 
      this menu doesn't appear in my interface. Role: Standard User. Have I 
      permission issue or is feature missing?"


HELPING IMPROVE THE SYSTEM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every issue you report helps:
? Fix problems for everyone
? Improve documentation clarity
? Identify missing features
? Enhance user experience
