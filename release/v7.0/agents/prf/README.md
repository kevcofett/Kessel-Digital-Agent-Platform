# Performance Agent (PRF)

## Purpose
Analyzes campaign performance, detects anomalies, and extracts learnings. Provides optimization recommendations based on historical data and benchmarks.

## Capabilities
- Performance analysis vs benchmarks
- Anomaly detection and alerting
- Learning extraction from campaigns
- Optimization trigger identification
- Trend analysis and forecasting
- Reallocation recommendations

## Flows
- AnalyzePerformance: Compares metrics to benchmarks and targets
- DetectAnomalies: Identifies statistical outliers in performance data
- ExtractLearnings: Generates insights from completed campaigns

## Example Queries
- "Analyze my campaign performance vs benchmarks"
- "Detect any anomalies in my metrics"
- "What learnings can we extract from Q4?"
- "Is the 15% CPA increase significant?"
- "Should we reallocate budget from display?"

## Routing Keywords
performance, analyze, anomaly, learning, optimize, trend, variance, kpi, benchmark, reallocation

## Dependencies
- Historical performance data
- Benchmark data for comparison
- Statistical thresholds configured
