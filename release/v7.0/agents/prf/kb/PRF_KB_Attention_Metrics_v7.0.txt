SECTION 1 - ATTENTION MEASUREMENT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

ATTENTION DEFINITION

Attention measurement quantifies how much mental focus a viewer gives to an advertisement, going beyond basic viewability to measure actual human engagement.

ATTENTION VS VIEWABILITY

VIEWABILITY (MRC STANDARD)
- Display: 50% of pixels in view for 1 second
- Video: 50% of pixels in view for 2 continuous seconds
- Binary metric (viewable or not)
- Does not measure human attention

ATTENTION MEASUREMENT
- Duration of eye contact or focus
- Quality of engagement
- Cognitive processing indicators
- Continuous scale, not binary

WHY ATTENTION MATTERS
- Viewable does not equal viewed
- Attention predicts brand impact
- Enables quality-based optimization
- Differentiates premium inventory

ATTENTION DRIVERS

CREATIVE FACTORS
- Visual complexity
- Motion and animation
- Brand prominence
- Message clarity
- Emotional resonance

MEDIA FACTORS
- Ad format and size
- Placement on page
- Content environment
- Device and screen size
- User context and intent

EXPOSURE FACTORS
- Time in view
- Share of screen
- Clutter level
- Sound on/off
- User control (skippable)

================================================================================
SECTION 2 - ATTENTION MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGIES
================================================================================

EYE TRACKING

METHODOLOGY
Cameras track eye movement to measure:
- Fixations (where eyes rest)
- Saccades (eye movements)
- Dwell time (duration of focus)
- Gaze patterns

PANEL-BASED APPROACH
- Recruited panel members
- Controlled viewing environment
- High accuracy
- Limited scale

WEBCAM-BASED APPROACH
- Opt-in webcam tracking
- Natural environment
- More scalable
- Lower precision

METRICS DERIVED
- Attention seconds
- Percent of ad viewed
- Brand fixation time
- Call-to-action fixation

PREDICTIVE MODELS

METHODOLOGY
Machine learning models predict attention based on:
- Historical eye tracking data
- Creative characteristics
- Placement features
- User behavior signals

ADVANTAGES
- Scalable to all impressions
- Real-time application
- Lower cost than direct measurement
- Enables optimization

LIMITATIONS
- Model accuracy varies
- Training data quality matters
- May miss novel situations
- Requires validation

ENGAGEMENT PROXIES

BEHAVIORAL SIGNALS
- Mouse movement and scrolling
- Time on page
- Video completion
- Interaction events
- Audio engagement

ADVANTAGES
- Readily available data
- No additional tracking needed
- Scalable

LIMITATIONS
- Indirect measure
- Not equivalent to attention
- Platform-dependent

ATTENTION SECONDS

DEFINITION
Estimated seconds of active attention to an advertisement.

CALCULATION VARIES BY VENDOR
Typically combines:
- Time in view
- Viewability percentage
- Predicted attention probability
- Format-specific factors

BENCHMARKS
- Display standard: 0.5-1.5 attention seconds
- Display premium: 1.5-3.0 attention seconds
- Video: 3-10 attention seconds (varies by length)
- CTV: 5-15 attention seconds

ATTENTION ADJUSTED CPM (aCPM)

DEFINITION
Cost per thousand impressions adjusted for attention quality.

FORMULA
aCPM = CPM / Attention_Factor

Or equivalently:
aCPM = (Spend / Attention_Seconds) x 1000

EXAMPLE
- Campaign A: $10 CPM, 1.0 attention seconds = $10 aCPM
- Campaign B: $15 CPM, 2.0 attention seconds = $7.50 aCPM
- Campaign B is more efficient despite higher CPM

COST PER ATTENTION SECOND

DEFINITION
Cost to achieve one second of attention.

FORMULA
CPA_Second = Spend / Total_Attention_Seconds

USE CASE
Compare efficiency across formats and placements on attention basis.

ATTENTION-BASED OUTCOMES

ATTENTION TO OUTCOME CORRELATION
Research shows attention correlates with:
- Brand recall
- Brand consideration
- Purchase intent
- Actual sales

ATTENTION THRESHOLD
Minimum attention for impact varies:
- Brand awareness: 1-2 seconds
- Brand recall: 2-4 seconds
- Persuasion: 4+ seconds
- Varies by creative and objective

FRAMEWORK
Move from reach and frequency to attention-based planning.

ATTENTION REACH
Total attention seconds delivered to target audience.

ATTENTION FREQUENCY
Average attention seconds per person reached.

PLANNING APPROACH
- Set attention goals based on objectives
- Model attention by channel and format
- Allocate budget to maximize attention

SECTION 6 - OUTCOMES MEASUREMENT
================================================================================

ATTENTION TO OUTCOMES FRAMEWORK

BRAND OUTCOMES

AWARENESS IMPACT
Attention seconds needed for awareness lift.
Research suggests: 1-2 seconds minimum.

RECALL IMPACT
Attention seconds needed for unaided recall.
Research suggests: 2-4 seconds typical.

CONSIDERATION IMPACT
Attention seconds needed for consideration lift.
Research suggests: 3-5 seconds typical.

SALES OUTCOMES

ATTENTION AND CONVERSION
Higher attention correlates with higher conversion.
Relationship varies by category and creative.

ATTENTION-BASED ATTRIBUTION
Weight touchpoints by attention level.
High-attention exposures get more credit.

ROAS IMPLICATIONS
If attention predicts outcomes, attention-optimized campaigns should deliver better ROAS.

ROAS FORMULA REMINDER
ROAS = (Revenue - Ad Spend) / Ad Spend

Attention optimization should improve the revenue numerator through better quality exposures.

MEASUREMENT APPROACHES

ATTENTION-OUTCOME CORRELATION
Analyze relationship between attention metrics and outcomes:
- Brand lift by attention quartile
- Conversion rate by attention level
- Sales lift by attention exposure

INCREMENTALITY TESTING
Test attention-optimized campaigns vs standard:
- A/B test with attention targeting
- Measure outcome difference
- Calculate attention premium ROI

SECTION 8 - AGENT APPLICATION GUIDANCE
================================================================================

WHEN TO RECOMMEND ATTENTION MEASUREMENT

GOOD FIT
- Brand-building campaigns
- Video-heavy media plans
- Quality over quantity focus
- Premium inventory investment
- Performance plateau situations

LESS RELEVANT
- Direct response only
- Limited budget
- Short campaign duration
- Highly targeted niche

ATTENTION RECOMMENDATIONS

FOR AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS
- Target 2+ attention seconds per impression
- Prioritize high-attention formats (CTV, video)
- Optimize creative for attention capture
- Accept higher CPM for higher attention

FOR CONSIDERATION CAMPAIGNS
- Target 3+ attention seconds
- Balance attention and targeting
- Use attention to weight attribution
- Monitor attention-to-action correlation

FOR CONVERSION CAMPAIGNS
- Attention still matters but balance with efficiency
- Retargeting may have lower attention but high intent
- Use attention as secondary optimization

WARNING SIGNS
- High viewability but low outcomes: Attention issue
- Premium CPM without performance: Check attention
- Creative fatigue: Attention often declines first

LIMITATIONS TO ACKNOWLEDGE
- Attention measurement is evolving
- Standardization still developing
- Correlation is not causation
- Context matters significantly
