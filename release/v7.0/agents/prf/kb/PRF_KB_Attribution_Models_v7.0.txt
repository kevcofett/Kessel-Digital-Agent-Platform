PRF ATTRIBUTION MODELS v1

PURPOSE

This document provides guidance on attribution model selection, interpretation, and optimization. Reference when users ask about conversion credit, measurement approaches, or cross-channel attribution.

ATTRIBUTION FUNDAMENTALS

DEFINITION

Attribution is the process of assigning credit for conversions to marketing touchpoints. No single model captures complete truth - each provides a useful but incomplete perspective on channel contribution.

THE ATTRIBUTION CHALLENGE

Users encounter multiple touchpoints before converting:
- Average B2C path: 6-8 touchpoints
- Average B2B path: 15-20 touchpoints
- Cross-device journeys: Often invisible
- Offline influence: Difficult to measure

Attribution models attempt to fairly distribute credit across these touchpoints despite incomplete data and inherent limitations.

RULE-BASED MODELS

LAST CLICK

Assigns 100 percent credit to final touchpoint before conversion.

Advantages:
- Simple to implement and understand
- Deterministic and consistent
- Favors bottom-funnel channels

Disadvantages:
- Ignores awareness and consideration touchpoints
- Undervalues brand building
- Creates perverse optimization incentives

Best Used When:
- Baseline measurement needed
- Simple path-to-purchase
- Lower-funnel optimization focus

FIRST CLICK

Assigns 100 percent credit to initial touchpoint.

Advantages:
- Values awareness and discovery
- Simple to understand
- Highlights demand generation

Disadvantages:
- Ignores conversion-driving touchpoints
- Overvalues top-funnel regardless of quality
- May credit irrelevant first touches

Best Used When:
- Understanding demand generation
- New customer acquisition focus
- Awareness campaign evaluation

LINEAR

Distributes credit equally across all touchpoints.

Advantages:
- Acknowledges full customer journey
- No single channel over-credited
- Fair starting point for analysis

Disadvantages:
- Treats all touches as equally valuable
- May over-credit low-impact touchpoints
- Does not reflect diminishing returns

Best Used When:
- Initial multi-touch exploration
- Long, complex sales cycles
- When no strong hypothesis exists

TIME DECAY

Assigns more credit to touchpoints closer to conversion.

Advantages:
- Balances full path with recency
- Reflects temporal proximity to decision
- More nuanced than single-touch

Disadvantages:
- Arbitrary decay rate selection
- Still undervalues early touchpoints
- May not reflect actual influence

Best Used When:
- Short consideration windows
- Balancing awareness with conversion
- When recency reasonably indicates influence

POSITION BASED

Assigns fixed percentage to first and last, distributes remainder to middle.

Common Configuration: 40-20-40
- 40 percent to first touch
- 20 percent distributed to middle touches
- 40 percent to last touch

Advantages:
- Values both discovery and conversion
- Acknowledges middle touches
- Configurable weightings

Disadvantages:
- Arbitrary position weighting
- Middle touches may be undervalued
- Does not reflect actual influence patterns

Best Used When:
- Need balance of awareness and conversion
- Path length is consistent
- Want simple multi-touch model

DATA-DRIVEN MODELS

ALGORITHMIC ATTRIBUTION

Uses machine learning to determine credit based on conversion patterns.

How It Works:
- Analyzes paths that convert vs paths that do not
- Identifies touchpoint patterns correlated with conversion
- Assigns credit based on statistical contribution
- Updates continuously with new data

Requirements:
- Sufficient conversion volume (typically 300 plus per month)
- Consistent tracking across touchpoints
- Adequate path diversity
- Clean data without gaps

Advantages:
- Reflects actual conversion patterns
- Adapts to changing behavior
- More accurate than rule-based

Disadvantages:
- Black box methodology
- Requires significant data volume
- Platform-specific implementations vary
- May not account for external factors

Platform Implementations:
- Google Ads Data-Driven Attribution
- Meta Conversion Lift and Attribution
- Adobe Analytics Attribution IQ
- Custom implementations via CDP or analytics

MARKETING MIX MODELING

Statistical approach measuring aggregate impact of marketing on business outcomes.

How It Works:
- Regression analysis of spend vs outcomes over time
- Controls for external factors (seasonality, economy, competition)
- Measures incremental contribution of each channel
- Typically uses 2-3 years of historical data

Components Measured:
- Base sales (would occur without marketing)
- Incremental sales by channel
- Saturation and diminishing returns
- Carryover effects (lagged impact)

Advantages:
- Privacy-safe (aggregate data only)
- Measures all channels including offline
- Captures long-term brand effects
- Accounts for external factors

Disadvantages:
- Requires significant historical data
- Slow to update (quarterly or annual)
- Cannot optimize in-flight campaigns
- Expensive to build and maintain

Best Used When:
- Strategic budget allocation
- Annual planning cycles
- Measuring brand advertising
- Cross-channel portfolio optimization

INCREMENTALITY MEASUREMENT

Determines true causal impact through controlled experiments.

Approaches:
- Randomized controlled tests (holdout groups)
- Geo-experiments (matched market testing)
- Ghost bids (bid without serving)
- Platform lift studies

Advantages:
- Measures causation not correlation
- Most accurate incrementality signal
- Validates attribution model outputs
- Privacy-compliant methodology

Disadvantages:
- Requires experimental design capability
- Forgone revenue during testing
- Statistical significance requirements
- May not scale to all channels

Best Used When:
- Validating attribution model outputs
- Major budget allocation decisions
- Channel introduction or exit decisions
- Disputing platform-reported results

MODEL SELECTION GUIDANCE

SELECTION FRAMEWORK

Consider these factors when choosing attribution approach:

Business Model:
- E-commerce with short cycles: Last-click adequate baseline
- B2B with long cycles: Linear or position-based minimum
- Brand-focused: MMM essential complement

Data Maturity:
- Limited tracking: Rule-based models only
- Good tracking, low volume: Position-based or time-decay
- Good tracking, high volume: Data-driven attribution
- Multi-year history: Add MMM

Budget Level:
- Under 100K annual: Rule-based sufficient
- 100K to 1M: Data-driven if volume supports
- 1M to 10M: Data-driven plus periodic incrementality
- Over 10M: Full measurement stack (MTA, MMM, incrementality)

TRIANGULATION APPROACH

No single model tells the complete truth. Best practice combines:

- Data-Driven Attribution for tactical optimization
- Marketing Mix Modeling for strategic allocation
- Incrementality Testing for validation

Compare outputs across methods:
- Consistent signals increase confidence
- Divergent signals warrant investigation
- Use incrementality as ground truth when available

MODEL INTERPRETATION

COMMON PITFALLS

Over-Attribution:
- Retargeting often over-credited (would have converted anyway)
- Branded search captures existing demand
- Affiliate conversions on loyal customers

Under-Attribution:
- Awareness channels driving untracked lift
- Cross-device journeys breaking paths
- View-through conversions excluded

Platform Bias:
- Each platform attributes favorably to itself
- Walled gardens cannot see external touchpoints
- Self-reported conversions often inflated

ADJUSTMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

For Retargeting:
- Apply 30-50 percent discount to platform-reported conversions
- Validate with holdout incrementality tests
- Monitor view-through vs click-through ratios

For Branded Search:
- Separate brand from non-brand in analysis
- Test brand search pauses for incrementality
- Attribute 50-70 percent of brand search elsewhere

For Social:
- Use platform lift studies when available
- Apply view-through conversion windows thoughtfully
- Account for cross-device journeys

CROSS-CHANNEL CONSIDERATIONS

DEDUPLICATION

Multiple platforms may claim same conversion:
- Implement consistent cross-platform tracking
- Use single source of truth (analytics platform)
- Apply deduplication logic to raw data
- Compare platform-reported vs deduplicated totals

UNIFIED MEASUREMENT

Ideal state includes:
- Single customer identity across touchpoints
- Consistent conversion definitions
- Cross-device tracking where possible
- Unified reporting dashboard

INCREMENTALITY OVERLAY

Layer incrementality findings on top of attribution:
- Calibrate attribution model outputs
- Identify over-attributed channels
- Inform budget reallocation decisions
- Update calibration periodically
