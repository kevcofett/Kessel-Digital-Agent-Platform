PURPOSE

This knowledge base provides the Performance Agent with comprehensive optimization trigger methodology including trigger conditions, action frameworks, and best practices for automated and guided performance optimization.

OPTIMIZATION TRIGGER FUNDAMENTALS

Understanding performance-based action triggers.

TRIGGER CONCEPT

What optimization triggers achieve.

Action initiation
- Performance-based activation
- Condition-driven response
- Automated or guided action
- Proactive optimization

Decision support
- Clear criteria
- Objective thresholds
- Consistent evaluation
- Reduced subjectivity

Efficiency
- Rapid response
- Scale across campaigns
- Reduced manual effort
- Continuous optimization

TRIGGER TYPES

Categories of optimization triggers.

Performance triggers
- Metric thresholds
- Rate changes
- Efficiency levels
- Goal progress

Time-based triggers
- Campaign phase
- Learning period complete
- Scheduled review
- Deadline approach

Event triggers
- Budget depletion
- Creative fatigue
- Audience saturation
- Competitive change

TRIGGER CONDITIONS

Defining optimization criteria.

PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS

Metric-based triggers.

Threshold conditions
- Metric exceeds value
- Metric falls below value
- Metric within range
- Metric outside range

Rate change conditions
- Increase percentage
- Decrease percentage
- Rate of change
- Acceleration

Duration conditions
- Consecutive periods
- Sustained level
- Trend duration
- Pattern persistence

COMPOSITE CONDITIONS

Multi-factor triggers.

AND conditions
- Multiple criteria met
- All required
- Confidence increase
- Precision improvement

OR conditions
- Any criteria met
- Any sufficient
- Sensitivity increase
- Broader coverage

Weighted conditions
- Factor importance
- Combined scoring
- Threshold on score
- Flexible evaluation

OPTIMIZATION ACTIONS

Responding to triggers.

ACTION TYPES

Categories of optimization response.

Budget actions
- Increase allocation
- Decrease allocation
- Reallocate across channels
- Pause spending

Targeting actions
- Audience expansion
- Audience narrowing
- Exclusion addition
- Bid adjustment

Creative actions
- Rotation adjustment
- Variant prioritization
- Fatigue response
- Testing activation

Bidding actions
- Bid increase
- Bid decrease
- Strategy change
- Target adjustment

ACTION FRAMEWORKS

Structured action approaches.

Recommendation only
- Suggest action
- Human decision
- Approval required
- Control maintained

Semi-automated
- Propose action

ACTION MAGNITUDE

Determining action size.

MAGNITUDE DETERMINATION

Calculating action amount.

Proportional response
- Variance-proportional
- Larger deviation larger action
- Graduated response
- Appropriate scale

Fixed increment
- Standard adjustment
