SECTION 1 - OPTIMIZATION TRIGGER FRAMEWORK
================================================================================

TRIGGER PHILOSOPHY

Optimization triggers are predefined thresholds that signal when campaign performance requires attention. Effective triggers balance sensitivity (catching real issues) with specificity (avoiding false alarms).

TRIGGER CATEGORIES

PACING TRIGGERS
Monitor spend trajectory against plan to ensure budget utilization aligns with flight dates and objectives.

EFFICIENCY TRIGGERS
Monitor cost metrics (CPM, CPC, CPA, CAC) against targets to identify efficiency degradation requiring intervention.

ENGAGEMENT TRIGGERS
Monitor user interaction metrics (CTR, CVR, VCR) to identify creative fatigue, audience mismatch, or conversion path issues.

DELIVERY TRIGGERS
Monitor impression, reach, and frequency delivery against plan to ensure campaign achieves intended scale and exposure.

QUALITY TRIGGERS
Monitor viewability, brand safety, and fraud metrics to ensure media quality meets standards.

================================================================================

VARIANCE CALCULATIONS

Variance_Pct = (Actual - Target) / Target x 100
Absolute_Variance = Actual - Target
Trending_Variance = (Current_Period - Prior_Period) / Prior_Period x 100

PACING CALCULATIONS

Pacing_Index = Actual_Spend / Expected_Spend x 100
Days_to_Budget_Exhaustion = Remaining_Budget / Daily_Spend_Rate
Projected_Final_Spend = Current_Spend + (Daily_Rate x Remaining_Days)

EFFICIENCY CALCULATIONS

Efficiency_Index = Target_CPA / Actual_CPA x 100
Marginal_Efficiency = Change_in_Conversions / Change_in_Spend
Performance_Score = Sum of (Metric_i x Weight_i) for all metrics

TRIGGER SCORING

Trigger_Priority = Severity_Score x Impact_Score x Urgency_Score
Severity_Score: Green=1, Yellow=2, Orange=3, Red=4
