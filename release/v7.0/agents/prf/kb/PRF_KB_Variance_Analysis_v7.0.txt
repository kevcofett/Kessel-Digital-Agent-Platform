PURPOSE

This knowledge base provides the Performance Agent with comprehensive variance analysis methodology including deviation detection, root cause investigation, and best practices for performance variance management.

VARIANCE ANALYSIS FUNDAMENTALS

Understanding performance deviations.

VARIANCE CONCEPT

What variance analysis achieves.

Deviation identification
- Actual versus expected
- Performance gap
- Quantified difference
- Direction assessment

Root cause discovery
- Why variance occurred
- Contributing factors
- Causal investigation
- Understanding development

Corrective action
- Response determination
- Remediation planning
- Adjustment execution
- Performance recovery

VARIANCE TYPES

Categories of performance variance.

Favorable variance
- Better than expected
- Positive deviation
- Opportunity signal
- Success amplification

Unfavorable variance
- Worse than expected
- Negative deviation
- Problem signal
- Issue remediation

Volume variance
- Quantity difference
- Scale deviation
- Reach or impression gap
- Activity level

Rate variance
- Efficiency difference
- Percentage deviation
- Quality gap
- Effectiveness level

VARIANCE CALCULATION

Computing performance deviations.

ABSOLUTE VARIANCE

Difference calculation.

Simple difference
- Actual minus expected

Percentage calculation
- Difference divided by expected
- Percentage expression
- Scale-independent
- Comparison friendly

Variance components
- Volume contribution
- Rate contribution
- Mix contribution
- Decomposition analysis

STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE

Meaningful deviation assessment.

Significance testing
- Is variance real
