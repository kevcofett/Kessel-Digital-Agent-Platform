SECTION 1 - AUCTION TYPE FUNDAMENTALS
================================================================================

PROGRAMMATIC AUCTION TYPES

SECOND-PRICE AUCTION (LEGACY)
- Winner pays second-highest bid plus minimum increment
- Dominant auction type until 2019
- Encourages truthful bidding at true value
- Winner pays: Second_Highest_Bid + 0.01

FIRST-PRICE AUCTION (CURRENT STANDARD)
- Winner pays exactly their bid amount
- Now dominant across most exchanges
- Requires bid shading for efficiency
- Winner pays: Winning_Bid

HEADER BIDDING DYNAMICS
- Multiple SSPs compete simultaneously
- Publisher selects highest bid across all SSPs
- Creates first-price-like dynamics even in second-price auctions
- Timeout typically 400-1000ms

AUCTION TRANSITION IMPACT

EFFICIENCY CHANGE
- Second-price: Bid true value, pay market-clearing price
- First-price: Bid below true value to avoid overpaying
- Efficiency loss if not bid shading properly

CPM IMPACT
- Initial first-price CPMs rose 20-40 percent
- DSPs implemented bid shading to compensate
- Current CPMs approximately at second-price equivalents

STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS
- Bid landscape analysis more important
- Win rate becomes key optimization lever
- Price paid more variable

================================================================================
SECTION 2 - BID SHADING FUNDAMENTALS
================================================================================

BID SHADING DEFINITION

Bid shading reduces bids below true value in first-price auctions to avoid overpaying while maintaining acceptable win rates.

SHADING FORMULA
Shaded_Bid = True_Value x (1 - Shade_Factor)

Where:
- True_Value: Maximum willingness to pay
- Shade_Factor: Reduction percentage (typically 0.15 to 0.40)
- Shaded_Bid: Actual bid submitted

OPTIMAL SHADE FACTOR

Shade factor depends on competitive intensity:

LOW COMPETITION ENVIRONMENT
- Few bidders, abundant inventory
- Optimal shade: 30-40 percent
- Higher margins achievable

MODERATE COMPETITION ENVIRONMENT
- Multiple bidders, balanced inventory
- Optimal shade: 20-30 percent
- Balance win rate and efficiency

HIGH COMPETITION ENVIRONMENT
- Many bidders, scarce inventory
- Optimal shade: 10-20 percent
- Prioritize winning over margins

BID SHADING APPROACHES

STATIC BID SHADING
- Fixed shade factor across all bids
- Simple to implement
- Example: Always bid 75 percent of true value
- Limitation: Ignores auction-specific factors

DYNAMIC BID SHADING
- Shade factor varies by auction characteristics
- Considers: inventory type, publisher, time, competition
- More efficient but complex
- Industry standard approach

ML-BASED BID SHADING
- Machine learning predicts optimal bid
- Features: historical win rates, market prices, inventory signals
- Maximizes expected value
- Requires significant data

================================================================================
SECTION 3 - WIN RATE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

WIN RATE DEFINITION

Win_Rate = Auctions_Won / Auctions_Participated x 100

WIN RATE BENCHMARKS

BY CAMPAIGN TYPE
- Prospecting campaigns: 15-30 percent typical
- Retargeting campaigns: 30-50 percent typical
- Private marketplace deals: 40-70 percent typical

BY INVENTORY TYPE
- Open exchange: 10-25 percent typical
- Private marketplace: 30-60 percent typical
- Programmatic guaranteed: 90-100 percent (committed)

BY COMPETITIVE INTENSITY
- Low competition: 40-60 percent achievable
- Moderate competition: 20-40 percent typical
- High competition: 5-15 percent typical

WIN RATE OPTIMIZATION

WIN RATE VS CPM TRADE-OFF
- Higher bids increase win rate but raise CPM
- Lower bids reduce CPM but decrease win rate
- Optimal point maximizes value delivered per dollar

FINDING OPTIMAL WIN RATE
- Plot win rate against bid level
- Calculate cost per conversion at each point
- Find win rate that minimizes cost per outcome
- Adjust based on delivery requirements

WIN RATE BY SEGMENT
Analyze win rates across:
- Publisher categories
- Device types
- Geographic regions
- Time of day
- Audience segments

IDENTIFYING OPPORTUNITIES
- Segments with high win rate and good performance: Scale
- Segments with low win rate and good performance: Bid higher
- Segments with high win rate and poor performance: Reduce priority
- Segments with low win rate and poor performance: Exclude

================================================================================
SECTION 4 - BID LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

BID LANDSCAPE DEFINITION

The bid landscape represents the distribution of competitive bids for a given impression type.

BID LANDSCAPE COMPONENTS

FLOOR PRICE
- Minimum acceptable bid set by publisher or SSP
- Varies by publisher, placement, audience
- Bidding below floor guarantees loss
- Range: $0.10 to $20+ CPM depending on inventory

CLEARING PRICE
- Price needed to win auction
- In first-price: Winning bid amount
- In second-price: Second highest bid

MARKET PRICE ESTIMATE
- Predicted clearing price for impression type
- Based on historical auction data
- Used to inform shading decisions

BID DISTRIBUTION PERCENTILES
- 25th percentile: Low clearing price
- 50th percentile: Median clearing price
- 75th percentile: High clearing price
- 95th percentile: Premium clearing price

LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS METRICS

BID DENSITY CALCULATION
Identify where most competitive bids cluster.

SPREAD ANALYSIS
Spread = 75th_Percentile - 25th_Percentile

Interpretation:
- Narrow spread: Competitive, little room for shading
- Wide spread: Opportunity for strategic bidding

FLOOR RATE ANALYSIS
Floor_Hit_Rate = Bids_Below_Floor / Total_Bids x 100

Action if high:
- Raise minimum bid thresholds
- Exclude low-value inventory
- Improve floor price prediction

MARKET PRICE ESTIMATION METHODS

HISTORICAL AVERAGE
Market_Price = Average of Recent_Clearing_Prices

Simple but lags market changes.

EXPONENTIAL MOVING AVERAGE
EMA_t = Alpha x Price_t + (1 - Alpha) x EMA_t-1

Where Alpha = 2 / (N + 1), N = smoothing periods.
More responsive to recent prices.

ML-BASED PREDICTION
Features: publisher, placement, audience, time, device
Model: Regression predicting clearing price
Most accurate but requires infrastructure

================================================================================
SECTION 5 - HEADER BIDDING OPTIMIZATION
================================================================================

HEADER BIDDING OVERVIEW

Header bidding allows publishers to offer impressions to multiple SSPs simultaneously before calling their ad server.

HEADER BIDDING MECHANICS
- User loads page
- Header wrapper calls multiple SSPs in parallel
- Each SSP runs auction, returns highest bid
- Publisher collects all responses (with timeout)
- Highest response wins

TIMEOUT CONSIDERATIONS

TIMEOUT DEFINITION
Maximum time publisher waits for SSP responses.

TYPICAL TIMEOUTS
- Desktop: 800-1500ms
- Mobile web: 400-800ms
- Mobile app: 200-400ms

TIMEOUT IMPLICATIONS FOR BUYERS
- Slow DSP response may miss auction
- Faster response time improves win opportunity
- Target response time: Under 100ms from DSP

SUPPLY PATH IMPLICATIONS

DUPLICATE BID REQUESTS
Same impression may come from multiple SSPs.

DEDUPLICATION IMPORTANCE
- Avoid bidding multiple times on same impression
- Prevents self-competition
- Reduces wasted bid evaluations

PATH SELECTION CRITERIA
- SSP fee structure
- Historical win rates by path
- Response time consistency
- Data leakage concerns

================================================================================
SECTION 6 - FREQUENCY AND COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS
================================================================================

FREQUENCY IN AUCTION STRATEGY

FREQUENCY-AWARE BIDDING
Adjust bids based on user exposure count.

BID ADJUSTMENT BY FREQUENCY
- First exposure: Full bid (100 percent)
- Exposures 2-3: Maintained bid (100 percent)
- Exposures 4-6: Reduced bid (70-90 percent)
- Exposures 7+: Significantly reduced (30-50 percent)

FREQUENCY CAP INTERACTION
- Caps prevent bidding above threshold
- Efficient frequency capping reduces wasted auctions
- Cross-device frequency harder to manage

COMPETITIVE RESPONSE STRATEGIES

IDENTIFYING COMPETITORS
- Analyze win rate changes over time
- Monitor clearing price trends
- Track impression share changes

COMPETITIVE SCENARIOS

COMPETITOR INCREASING SPEND
- Clearing prices rise
- Win rates decrease
- Options: Increase bids, find alternative inventory, wait

COMPETITOR DECREASING SPEND
- Clearing prices fall
- Win rates increase
- Opportunity: Capture share at better prices

SEASONAL COMPETITION
- Q4 clearing prices rise 30-100 percent
- Political season affects news inventory
- Adjust budgets and expectations accordingly

PACING AND AUCTION STRATEGY

EVEN PACING
- Bid consistently throughout flight
- Avoids end-of-flight price spikes
- May miss optimal market conditions

FRONT-LOADED PACING
- Aggressive early bidding
- Captures favorable early inventory
- Risk of overspending if market shifts

OPTIMIZED PACING
- Adjust bid aggressiveness based on delivery
- Behind pace: Increase bids and shade factor
- Ahead of pace: Reduce bids, increase shading

================================================================================
