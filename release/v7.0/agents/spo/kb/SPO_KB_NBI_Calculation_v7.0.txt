SECTION 1 - NET BENEFIT INDEX FUNDAMENTALS
================================================================================

NBI DEFINITION AND PURPOSE

The Net Benefit Index (NBI) is a decision metric for evaluating supply path optimization opportunities. NBI quantifies whether a proposed optimization will deliver net positive value after accounting for potential performance trade-offs.

CORE NBI FORMULA

NBI = Fee_Savings_Percent - (Effectiveness_Loss_Percent x Weight)

Where:
- Fee_Savings_Percent: Reduction in tech tax from optimization
- Effectiveness_Loss_Percent: Estimated performance degradation
- Weight: Multiplier reflecting campaign priority (typically 1.0-2.5)

INTERPRETATION

POSITIVE NBI: Optimization is recommended
- Benefits outweigh performance trade-offs
- Higher NBI indicates stronger recommendation
- Proceed with implementation

ZERO NBI: Neutral outcome
- Savings exactly offset by performance loss
- Decision depends on secondary factors
- Requires additional analysis

NEGATIVE NBI: Optimization not recommended
- Performance loss exceeds fee savings
- Current path may be optimal
- Maintain existing approach

================================================================================
SECTION 2 - NBI CALCULATION METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

STEP-BY-STEP CALCULATION

STEP 1 - CALCULATE FEE SAVINGS

Current_Working_Media = Publisher_Payment / Total_Spend x 100
Optimized_Working_Media = New_Publisher_Payment / Total_Spend x 100
Fee_Savings_Percent = Optimized_Working_Media - Current_Working_Media

STEP 2 - ESTIMATE EFFECTIVENESS LOSS

Compare current and proposed path quality indicators:
- Historical performance data if available
- Inventory quality scores
- Viewability benchmarks
- Brand safety ratings

Effectiveness_Loss_Percent = Current_Performance_Index - Projected_Performance_Index

STEP 3 - DETERMINE WEIGHT

Weight selection based on campaign priority:

AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS
- Weight: 1.0-1.5
- Rationale: Reach efficiency prioritized
- Higher tolerance for quality trade-offs

CONSIDERATION CAMPAIGNS
- Weight: 1.5-2.0
- Rationale: Balanced priority
- Moderate tolerance for trade-offs

CONVERSION CAMPAIGNS
- Weight: 2.0-2.5
- Rationale: Performance critical
- Low tolerance for quality degradation

STEP 4 - CALCULATE NBI

NBI = Fee_Savings_Percent - (Effectiveness_Loss_Percent x Weight)

EXAMPLE CALCULATION

SCENARIO
Current path: 45 percent working media
Optimized path: 55 percent working media
Current CTR: 0.12 percent
Projected CTR: 0.10 percent
Campaign type: Conversion (Weight: 2.0)

CALCULATION
Fee_Savings_Percent = 55 - 45 = 10 percent
Effectiveness_Loss_Percent = (0.12 - 0.10) / 0.12 x 100 = 16.7 percent
NBI = 10 - (16.7 x 2.0) = 10 - 33.4 = -23.4

RESULT: Negative NBI (-23.4)
RECOMMENDATION: Do not optimize. Performance loss outweighs fee savings.

SECTION 4 - EFFECTIVENESS LOSS ESTIMATION
================================================================================

ESTIMATING PERFORMANCE IMPACT

When historical data is unavailable, estimate effectiveness loss using proxy indicators.

INVENTORY QUALITY PROXY

TIER 1 TO TIER 2 SHIFT
Estimated effectiveness loss: 5-10 percent
Rationale: Slight reduction in premium inventory

TIER 1 TO TIER 3 SHIFT
Estimated effectiveness loss: 15-25 percent
Rationale: Notable quality reduction

TIER 2 TO TIER 3 SHIFT
Estimated effectiveness loss: 8-15 percent
Rationale: Moderate quality reduction

VIEWABILITY PROXY

For each 5 percentage point viewability drop:
Estimated effectiveness loss: 3-5 percent

Example:
Current viewability: 70 percent
Projected viewability: 60 percent
Estimated loss: 6-10 percent (2 x 5 point increments)

BRAND SAFETY PROXY

HIGH TO MEDIUM SAFETY
Estimated effectiveness loss: 2-5 percent
Increased risk of negative adjacency

MEDIUM TO LOW SAFETY
Estimated effectiveness loss: 5-10 percent
Significant brand risk exposure

AUDIENCE MATCH PROXY

For each 10 percentage point audience match rate drop:
Estimated effectiveness loss: 5-8 percent

Example:
Current match: 80 percent
Projected match: 65 percent
Estimated loss: 7.5-12 percent (1.5 x 10 point increments)

SECTION 5 - WEIGHT SELECTION GUIDE
================================================================================

WEIGHT DETERMINATION FACTORS

CAMPAIGN OBJECTIVE

Brand Awareness: Weight 1.0-1.3
- Reach and frequency primary goals
- Higher tolerance for efficiency trade-offs
- CPM efficiency often acceptable trade-off

Consideration and Engagement: Weight 1.3-1.8
- Balanced reach and performance
- Moderate tolerance for trade-offs
- Quality of engagement matters

Direct Response: Weight 1.8-2.3
- Conversion efficiency critical
- Low tolerance for performance loss
- Every conversion counts

Customer Acquisition: Weight 2.0-2.5
- LTV consideration critical
- Quality of conversions matters
- Higher weight protects value

BUDGET SIZE IMPACT

Small budgets (under $100K): Add 0.2 to weight

SECTION 6 - NBI APPLICATION SCENARIOS
================================================================================

SCENARIO 1 - DSP CONSOLIDATION

Situation: Advertiser using 4 DSPs, considering consolidation to 2

Current state:
- Average working media: 48 percent
- Average CTR: 0.15 percent
- Total spend: $500K monthly

Proposed state:
- Projected working media: 56 percent (volume discounts)
- Projected CTR: 0.14 percent (less inventory diversity)

Calculation:
- Fee_Savings = 56 - 48 = 8 percent
- Effectiveness_Loss = (0.15 - 0.14) / 0.15 x 100 = 6.7 percent
- Campaign type: Consideration (Weight: 1.5)
- NBI = 8 - (6.7 x 1.5) = 8 - 10 = -2

Result: Negative NBI. Consolidation not recommended with current projections.

SCENARIO 2 - SSP EXCLUSION LIST

- Win rate: 12 percent

Proposed state:
- Working media: 50 percent (fewer intermediaries)
- Viewability: 68 percent (better inventory)
- Win rate: 10 percent (less scale)

Calculation:
- Fee_Savings = 50 - 42 = 8 percent
- Viewability improvement: +13 points (positive effect)
- Win rate loss: -2 points (minor negative)
- Net Effectiveness_Loss = -5 percent (improvement)
- Campaign type: Brand (Weight: 1.2)
- NBI = 8 - (-5 x 1.2) = 8 + 6 = 14

- Data costs: $2.50 CPM
- Working media: 46 percent
- Target match: 85 percent

Proposed state:
- Data costs: $1.00 CPM
- Working media: 52 percent
- Target match: 70 percent

Calculation:
- Fee_Savings = 52 - 46 = 6 percent
- Target match loss = (85 - 70) / 85 x 100 = 17.6 percent
- Campaign type: Acquisition (Weight: 2.2)
- NBI = 6 - (17.6 x 2.2) = 6 - 38.7 = -32.7

Result: Strongly negative NBI. Maintain data layers.

================================================================================
SECTION 7 - NBI FORMULAS REFERENCE
================================================================================

CORE FORMULAS

NBI = Fee_Savings_Pct - (Effectiveness_Loss_Pct x Weight)

Fee_Savings_Pct = Optimized_Working_Media - Current_Working_Media

Effectiveness_Loss_Pct = (Current_Metric - Projected_Metric) / Current_Metric x 100

WORKING MEDIA FORMULAS

Working_Media_Pct = Publisher_Payment / Total_Spend x 100
Fee_Stack_Pct = 100 - Working_Media_Pct
Fee_Savings_Dollars = Annual_Spend x Fee_Savings_Pct / 100

WEIGHT ADJUSTMENT FORMULA

Final_Weight = Base_Weight + Objective_Adj + Budget_Adj + History_Adj + Competition_Adj

Where adjustments range from -0.3 to +0.3 each

CONFIDENCE ADJUSTED NBI

When estimation uncertainty is high:
Confidence_Adjusted_NBI = NBI x Confidence_Factor

Confidence factors:
- High confidence (historical data): 1.0
- Medium confidence (proxy estimates): 0.8
- Low confidence (assumptions): 0.6
