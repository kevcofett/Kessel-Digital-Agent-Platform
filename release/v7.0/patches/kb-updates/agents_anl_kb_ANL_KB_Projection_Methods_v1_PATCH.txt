DIMINISHING RETURNS ANALYSIS

Diminishing returns analysis identifies the budget inflection point where additional investment yields progressively smaller returns.

Key outputs:
- inflection_point: The budget level where efficiency begins declining significantly
- efficiency_curve: Visualization data showing efficiency vs budget relationship
- optimal_budget: Recommended budget level balancing reach and efficiency

Calculation uses log-linear response curves with channel-specific saturation coefficients derived from historical benchmark data.

Always include confidence intervals and note that actual inflection points vary by campaign type, vertical, and market conditions.
