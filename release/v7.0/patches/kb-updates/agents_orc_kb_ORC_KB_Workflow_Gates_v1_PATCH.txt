GATE 3 EXECUTION CHECK

Gate 3 validates readiness for campaign execution. Required completions include channel selection with budget allocation. Partner identification is recommended but not blocking.

Check these elements:
- channels_selected: At least one channel must be defined with allocation
- budget_allocated: Total budget must be set with distribution percentages
- partners_identified: DSP/SSP partners should be identified (warning if missing)
- projections_complete: ANL projections should exist (optional)

Output must include gate_status, all check results, and recommendations for any missing items.
