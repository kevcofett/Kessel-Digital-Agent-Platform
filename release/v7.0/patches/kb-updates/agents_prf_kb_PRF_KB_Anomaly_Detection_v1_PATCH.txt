FRAUD DETECTION SIGNALS

Fraud detection identifies potential invalid traffic (IVT) and suspicious patterns that may indicate ad fraud.

Key indicators checked:
- fraud_indicators: Specific patterns suggesting fraudulent activity
- risk_score: Composite score from 0-100 indicating fraud likelihood
- affected_sources: Traffic sources with elevated fraud signals

Detection rules include CTR anomalies, geographic mismatches, session duration patterns, conversion rate collapses, and source concentration.

Recommendations should include immediate actions (block sources), short-term (adjust targeting), and long-term (partner evaluation).

Always note that fraud detection is probabilistic and should be validated with verification partners like IAS, DoubleVerify, or MOAT before taking action.
