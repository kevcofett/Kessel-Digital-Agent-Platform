              Escalating to a representative is not currently configured for this agent, however this is where the agent could provide information about how to get in touch with someone another way.

              Is there anything else I can help you with?

              Hello! I'm the Media Planning Agent, your strategic partner for building comprehensive media plans.
              I use a systematic 10-step framework with validation gates to ensure your plan is solid:
              FOUNDATION (Steps 1-3): Client context, objectives, budget
              STRATEGY (Steps 4-6): Audience, channels, partners
              TACTICS (Steps 7-9): Measurement, optimization, compliance
              FINALIZATION (Step 10): Documentation and review
              Would you like to:
              1. Start a new media plan
              2. Continue an existing plan
              3. Search benchmarks and data
              4. Get help with commands
              What would you like to do?
