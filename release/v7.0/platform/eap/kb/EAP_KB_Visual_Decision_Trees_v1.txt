VISUAL DECISION TREES FRAMEWORK

PURPOSE

This document defines the visual decision tree system for the Kessel Digital Agent Platform. It covers interactive workflow visualization, decision path rendering, branching logic display, and user navigation through complex planning workflows.

DECISION TREE ARCHITECTURE

CORE CONCEPTS

Decision Tree Structure
- Root node represents initial planning state
- Branch nodes represent decision points
- Leaf nodes represent terminal states or outcomes
- Edges represent conditions or choices

Node Types
- Start node marks workflow entry point
- Decision node presents user with choices
- Action node executes platform capability
- Gate node validates prerequisites
- End node marks workflow completion
- Merge node combines parallel paths

Edge Types
- Conditional edge based on user input
- Default edge for fallback paths
- Validation edge based on gate results
- Loop edge for iterative processes

VISUAL REPRESENTATION

Node Rendering
- Rectangular nodes for actions
- Diamond nodes for decisions
- Rounded rectangles for start and end
- Hexagons for validation gates
- Circles for merge points

Color Coding
- Blue for current active node
- Green for completed nodes
- Gray for future pending nodes
- Red for blocked or failed nodes
- Yellow for nodes requiring attention
- Purple for optional bypass nodes

Connection Lines
- Solid lines for primary paths
- Dashed lines for optional paths
- Dotted lines for conditional bypasses
- Animated flow for active progression
