AUD PRIVACY COMPLIANCE v1

PURPOSE

This document provides guidance on privacy-compliant audience strategies. Reference when users ask about GDPR, CCPA, consent requirements, or privacy-first targeting approaches.

REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

GDPR - EUROPEAN UNION

The General Data Protection Regulation establishes strict requirements for processing personal data of EU residents.

Key Requirements:

CCPA AND CPRA - CALIFORNIA

The California Consumer Privacy Act and California Privacy Rights Act provide consumer rights over personal information.

US STATE PRIVACY LAWS

Additional state laws creating patchwork requirements:

Virginia VCDPA:
- Similar structure to CCPA

- No private right of action

Colorado CPA:
- Universal opt-out mechanism required
- Consent required for sensitive data
- Data protection assessments required

Connecticut CTDPA:
- Recognizes Global Privacy Control
- Consent for sensitive data processing
- 60-day cure period for violations

Other States:
- Utah, Texas, Oregon, Montana, and others pending
- Varying definitions and requirements
- Monitor for new legislation

CONSENT MANAGEMENT

CONSENT COLLECTION PRINCIPLES

Valid consent requires:
- Freely given without coercion
- Specific to stated purposes
- Informed with clear explanation
- Unambiguous affirmative action
- Demonstrable and documented
- Easy to withdraw

Consent Anti-Patterns to Avoid:
- Pre-checked boxes
- Bundled consent with service access
- Vague or overly broad language
- Hidden consent in terms of service
- Dark patterns that manipulate choice
- Consent fatigue exploitation

CONSENT MANAGEMENT PLATFORMS

CMP Selection Criteria:
- Geographic coverage for target markets
- Integration with advertising platforms
- Customization for brand experience
- Reporting and audit trail capabilities
- Mobile and app support
- Price and total cost of ownership

Implementation Best Practices:
- Clear and specific consent language
- Granular options by purpose and vendor
- Easy preference center access
- Regular consent refresh for long relationships
- Sync consent state across touchpoints
- Document all consent collection

Consent String Standards:
- IAB TCF 2.2 for programmatic advertising
- GPP (Global Privacy Platform) for US states
- Platform-specific consent signals

PREFERENCE CENTER DESIGN

Core Elements:
- Clear explanation of data usage
- Granular controls by purpose
- Easy toggle or checkbox interface
- Save and confirmation functionality
- Link from all communications

Purpose Categories to Include:
- Essential or functional cookies
- Analytics and performance
- Personalization
- Advertising and targeting
- Third-party sharing

DATA MINIMIZATION

COLLECTION PRINCIPLES

Collect only data necessary for stated purpose:
- Define purpose before collection
- Evaluate necessity of each field
- Avoid nice-to-have data collection
- Document justification for each data point

Field-Level Assessment:
- Is this field required for the stated purpose?
- Could the purpose be achieved with less data?
- Is there a less intrusive alternative?
- How long do we need to retain this data?

RETENTION POLICIES

Retention Period Guidelines:
- Transaction data: As required by financial regulations
- Marketing consent: Duration of relationship plus proof period
- Behavioral data: 13-24 months typical
- Customer service records: Per legal requirements
- Analytics data: Aggregate and anonymize after analysis

Automated Deletion:
- Implement automated purge processes
- Regular audit of data age
- Exception handling for legal holds
- Documentation of deletion actions

ANONYMIZATION AND AGGREGATION

When to Anonymize:
- Analytics and reporting
- Benchmarking and research
- Long-term trend analysis
- Sharing with third parties

Anonymization Techniques:
- Data masking and hashing
- K-anonymity requirements
- Differential privacy approaches
- Aggregation thresholds

PRIVACY-FIRST TARGETING

COOKIELESS STRATEGIES

As third-party cookies deprecate, alternative approaches include:

Contextual Targeting:
- Align ads with content context
- No user-level tracking required
- Keyword and semantic analysis
- Brand safety alignment benefit

Publisher First-Party Data:
- Seller-defined audiences
- Publisher authenticated users
- Content affinity segments
- High-quality, consented data

Cohort-Based Approaches:
- Privacy Sandbox Topics API
- Aggregated interest categories
- No individual-level tracking
- Browser-managed privacy

First-Party Identity:
- Authenticated user targeting
- Hashed email matching
- Consent-based activation
- Highest match quality

PRIVACY-PRESERVING MEASUREMENT

Aggregated Reporting:
- Aggregate attribution APIs
- Summary reports without user-level data
- Minimum threshold requirements

Incrementality Focus:
- Geo-based lift measurement
- Holdout group methodology
- No individual tracking required

Modeled Conversions:
- Statistical modeling for gaps
- Calibrated with consented data
- Transparent methodology disclosure

CLEAN ROOM COMPLIANCE

Privacy Benefits:
- Data never leaves owner control
- Query-level access, not data access
- Aggregation and noise requirements
- Audit trail of all queries

Compliance Considerations:
- Data processing agreements required
- Purpose limitation still applies
- Output must meet anonymization standards
- User rights extend to clean room data

COMPLIANCE OPERATIONS
