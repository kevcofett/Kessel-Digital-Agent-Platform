CHA KNOWLEDGE BASE - FLIGHTING AND TIMING OPTIMIZATION

VERSION INFORMATION

Document version 1.0 released January 2026. This knowledge base provides comprehensive methodology for flighting pattern optimization, daypart analysis, seasonality adjustment, and cross-channel frequency management.

OVERVIEW

Timing is as important as targeting in media planning. When you reach audiences affects response as much as who you reach. This methodology provides frameworks for optimizing flighting patterns, analyzing daypart performance, adjusting for seasonality, and managing frequency across channels.

Effective timing optimization balances reach building, efficiency, competitive dynamics, and audience availability to maximize campaign impact.

FLIGHTING PATTERN FUNDAMENTALS

CONTINUOUS FLIGHTING

Continuous flighting maintains steady presence:
- Consistent daily or weekly investment
- Builds reach cumulatively over time
- Maintains top-of-mind awareness
- Appropriate for always-on categories
- Provides consistent competitive presence

Continuous flighting advantages:
- Steady reach accumulation
- Consistent brand presence
- Easier to manage and forecast
- Protects against competitive gaps
- Supports ongoing consideration

Continuous flighting disadvantages:
- May dilute impact at any moment
- Budget may be insufficient for consistent impact
- Does not capitalize on peak opportunities
- May reach diminishing returns on frequency

PULSING FLIGHTING

Pulsing alternates intensity levels:
- Periods of heavier investment
- Followed by periods of lighter investment
- Maintains presence while creating peaks
- Balances awareness with budget efficiency
- Allows impact concentration

Pulsing pattern design:
- Define pulse duration typically 1 to 4 weeks
- Define maintenance period between pulses
- Set intensity ratio between pulse and maintenance
- Align pulses with business objectives
- Plan pulse timing strategically

Pulsing advantages:
- Creates impact peaks while maintaining presence
- More budget efficient than continuous at same level
- Allows competitive response during pulses
- Supports promotional calendar
- Balances reach and frequency tradeoffs

BURST FLIGHTING

Burst concentrates investment in short windows:
- Heavy investment for limited duration
- Followed by dark or minimal period
- Creates maximum impact during burst
- Appropriate for launches and events
- Requires precise timing

Burst pattern design:
- Define burst duration typically 1 to 2 weeks
- Determine burst intensity as percentage of budget
- Plan dark period duration
- Align burst with key moments
- Coordinate across channels for maximum impact

Burst advantages:
- Maximum impact during critical moments
- Efficient for event-driven marketing
- Creates breakthrough messaging
- Supports competitive counter-programming
- Enables testing at high intensity

Burst disadvantages:
- Awareness decays during dark periods
- May miss audiences not available during burst
- Risk if timing is wrong
- Less reach than continuous at same budget

HEAVY-UP PERIODS

Heavy-up increases investment during key windows:
- Layer additional investment on base
- Timed to coincide with opportunities
- Maintains continuity while creating peaks
- Supports promotional periods
- Responds to competitive activity

Heavy-up planning:
- Identify heavy-up triggers and timing
- Budget reserve for heavy-up periods
- Define intensity increase ratio
- Plan channel mix during heavy-up
- Coordinate creative messaging

DARK PERIODS

Dark periods pause or minimize investment:
- Strategic reduction in presence
- May be complete pause or minimal
- Allow budget reallocation to peaks
- May follow saturation concerns
- Can test awareness decay

Dark period considerations:
- Duration limits to avoid awareness loss
- Competitive risk during dark periods
- Frequency decay modeling
- Re-entry timing planning
- Alternative presence through earned or owned

FLIGHTING OPTIMIZATION METHODOLOGY

OBJECTIVE-TO-PATTERN MAPPING

Awareness objectives pattern guidance:
- Continuous or pulsing maintains presence
- Front-loaded builds awareness quickly
- Reach priority favors spread over concentration
- Frequency caps prevent over-delivery

Consideration objectives pattern guidance:
- Pulsing creates evaluation moments
- Alignment with decision windows
- Retargeting peaks during consideration
- Sequential messaging across pulses

Conversion objectives pattern guidance:
- Performance-responsive pacing
- Heavy-up during high-intent periods
- Burst around conversion events
- Back-loaded to optimize performance

Brand objectives pattern guidance:
- Continuous maintains brand presence
- Pulsing refreshes brand messaging
- Event alignment for relevance
- Consistent share of voice priority

REACH AND FREQUENCY TRADEOFFS

Flighting affects reach-frequency balance:
- Concentrated flighting builds frequency faster
- Spread flighting maximizes reach
- Pulsing balances both objectives
- Target frequency affects pattern choice

Reach-frequency by pattern:
- Continuous at low level maximizes reach
- Burst at high level builds frequency
- Pulsing achieves moderate reach and frequency
- Pattern should match campaign priority

BUDGET EFFICIENCY BY PATTERN

Efficiency varies by flighting approach:
- Continuous may pay premium for steady inventory
- Burst faces competition during peak periods
- Off-peak timing may offer efficiency
- Pattern affects CPM and CPV

Efficiency optimization:
- Balance timing priority with cost efficiency
- Consider inventory supply dynamics
- Negotiate commitments for timing flexibility
- Test efficiency across timing options

COMPETITIVE TIMING RESPONSE

Consider competitor timing in pattern:
- Match competitors if share defense priority
- Counter-program to avoid clutter
- Exploit gaps in competitor coverage
- Anticipate competitor responses

Competitive timing strategies:
- Shadow strategy matches competitor timing
- Flanking strategy avoids competitor peaks
- Pre-emptive strategy leads competitor
- Opportunistic strategy exploits gaps

DECAY CONSIDERATIONS

Awareness decays during gaps:
- Model decay rate for your category
- Limit dark periods based on decay
- Plan re-entry timing to rebuild
- Use organic presence during gaps

Decay mitigation:
- Maintain minimal presence during light periods
- Use owned and earned media during paid gaps
- Retarget engaged users to maintain connection
- Plan messaging sequence for re-entry
