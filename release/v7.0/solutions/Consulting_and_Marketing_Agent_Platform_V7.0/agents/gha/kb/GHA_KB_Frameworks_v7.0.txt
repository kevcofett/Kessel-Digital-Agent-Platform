==================================================
01. GROWTH HACKING FRAMEWORKS (CORE MODELS)
==================================================

Framework: AARRR (Dave McClure – Pirate Metrics)
Description: The original funnel used to analyze and design growth systems.
Stages:
1. Acquisition – Get users in the door
2. Activation – Deliver first "wow" moment
3. Retention – Keep them coming back
4. Referral – Turn them into advocates
5. Revenue – Monetize usage

Use Case: Dropbox  
Tactic: Offered 250MB storage for each referral. Activation and referral were stacked.  
Result: 3900% growth in 15 months.

---

Framework: AAARRRP (Modern Lifecycle Expansion)
Adds:
+ Reactivation – Revive inactive users
+ Productization – Bake growth into the product (PLG)
+ Personalization – Use behavioral data for lifecycle nudges

Use Case: Calm App  
Tactic: Sent personalized meditation stats and “You’re in the top 12%” leaderboards to re-engage.  
Layer: Reactivation + Personalization

---

Framework: Growth Loop Model
Concept: Funnels are linear; **loops are compounding**.
Inputs → Triggers → Action → Output → Refeeds system

Examples:
- Content Loop: User posts → Friends see → They join → They post  
- Product Loop: Invite friend → unlock premium → friend invites  
- Transaction Loop: User buys → gets rewards → reinvests → buys again

Use Case: Notion  
Loop: Share template → other user signs up → creates → shares again.

---

Framework: Hook Model (Nir Eyal)
Cycle:
1. Trigger (external/internal)
2. Action
3. Variable Reward
4. Investment

Use Case: Instagram  
Trigger: Notification  
Action: Tap app  
Reward: New likes/comments  
Investment: Post photo = data fuel for future notifications

---

Framework: Power User Curve
Focus: Time-based usage — do 10% of users come back > X times in Y days?
Use Case: Slack  
Goal: 2,000 messages across org → "sticky" metric  
Tactic: Product usage nudges tied to team onboarding + integrations

---

Framework: North Star Metric Model
Find the **one metric that best correlates with long-term success**

Examples:
- Airbnb: Nights booked
- Facebook: Monthly active users
- Spotify: Minutes streamed
- Duolingo: Number of lessons completed

---

Framework: High-Tempo Testing (Sean Ellis)
Cycle:
- Prioritize 3–5 weekly experiments
- Use ICE or PIE scoring to stack them
- Deploy > learn > keep or kill fast

Use Case: GrowthHackers.com  
Over 30 weekly growth tests led to identifying one referral loop that scaled platform growth.

==================================================
02. PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES THAT POWER GROWTH
==================================================

💥 Scarcity
Tactic: Limited-time or limited-access features
Case: Clubhouse (invite-only = insane viral FOMO)

💥 Social Proof
Tactic: “Join 94,000 other designers”
Case: Figma launched via community events + social leaderboards

💥 Mimetic Desire (Rene Girard)
Tactic: We want what others want
Case: BeReal’s exclusivity triggered people’s curiosity through friend feeds

💥 Curiosity Loops
Tactic: “Unlock hidden feature” or delayed reward
Case: Duolingo's daily streak chests

💥 Reward Prediction Error
Tactic: User expects X, gets Y → triggered dopamine
Case: Tinder Super Likes + unexpected matches

💥 Identity Triggers
Tactic: Let user define themselves via behavior
Case: Spotify Wrapped → people share it because it reflects *them*

💥 Effort Justification
Tactic: If they worked for it, they value it more
Case: Reddit Karma → you grind, you earn, you brag

💥 Loss Aversion
Tactic: “You’ll lose this reward if you don’t act”
Case: Amazon Lightning Deals with countdown timers

💥 Scarcity X Status
Tactic: Not everyone gets in. Not everyone should.
Case: American Express Black Card – invite-only, myth-building, elite desire

==================================================
03. EXECUTION MODELS BY LIFECYCLE STAGE
==================================================

### A. ACQUISITION
Tactics:
- Waitlists with reward stacking (e.g., Morning Brew)
- Viral referral ladders (e.g., Robinhood)
- Challenger campaigns (“Don’t get XYZ, try us instead”)
- Side project SEO traps (e.g., “free calculator” → product)

### B. ACTIVATION
Tactics:
- Gamified onboarding (progress bar, “3 steps left!”)
- Product tours with soft personalization
- Surprise + delight (hidden feature after first use)
- Use-case triggered nudges (e.g., Calendly auto-sending value props after 1st meeting booked)

### C. USAGE EXPANSION
Tactics:
- Secret multiplier zones (e.g., mystery cashback)
- Weekly usage streaks
- “Spend across 3 categories = bonus”
- Product suggestions based on unusual behavior (“People who did this unlocked XYZ”)

### D. RETENTION
Tactics:
- Dynamic email triggers based on inactivity patterns
- Personalized push nudges with past behavior callouts
- Limited edition loyalty missions
- “Return now and reclaim your reward”

### E. RE-ENGAGEMENT
Tactics:
- Funny/clever reactivation campaigns (“Are we on a break?”)
- Time-boxed challenges
- Reward retrieval: “Your bonus is expiring in 2 hours…”

### F. LOYALTY
Tactics:
- Gamified tier systems (not just points – prestige + perks)
- Shareable reward summaries (e.g., “Top 2% cashback earners!”)
- Family & team plans (create network lock-in)
- UGC incentives for long-term users

==================================================
04. SIGNATURE GROWTH CAMPAIGN FORMATS
==================================================

🧨 Viral Waitlist Mechanics
Case: Superhuman  
Stacked reward tiers (ref 1 friend = early access, ref 5 = concierge onboarding)

🎭 Guerrilla Drops
Case: Monzo (UK)  
Team handed out free drinks in bars to anyone who signed up on the spot.

🎟️ Scarcity & Invite Gaming
Case: Clubhouse  
Invite-only mechanic made users beg for access on Twitter & Reddit

🔁 Feedback Loops
Case: Zoom  
User sends invite → recipient becomes user → triggers another cycle

📲 Trigger Stacking
Case: Blinkist  
Used FOMO ads + 7-day free trial + premium lock to create a stack of emotional levers

🚪 Trojan Feature Campaigns
Case: HubSpot Website Grader  
Free SEO tool → captured emails → fed into CRM product funnel

==================================================
05. ADVANCED / GUERRILLA TACTICS
==================================================

🎯 Backdoor Invites
Create secret URLs that bypass normal signup — shared via “leaks” on Reddit/Discord.

🧬 Viral UX Design
Build UGC by design (e.g., AI image tools adding watermark that drives clicks)

💣 Fake Failures
Break something on purpose — or pretend to. “We’re out of invites.” → people chase more.

🧩 Puzzle Mechanics
Hide features or benefits behind small games, taps, scrolls. Triggers curiosity.

📦 Loot Box Behavior
Unlockable surprise rewards (Duolingo, mobile games) → unpredictable dopamine.

📈 Competitive Comparison Leaderboards
Case: Grammarly Weekly Reports  
“You wrote more than 97% of users this week” → status loop
