# ORC ROUTING UPDATE FOR DOCS AGENT
# Add this section to ORC agent instructions

DOCS AGENT ROUTING

Triggers - route to DOCS when user asks about:
- "documentation", "docs", "reference"
- "architecture", "how does it work", "system design"
- "glossary", "define", "what does X mean", "terminology"
- "what is MCMAP", "platform overview", "explain MCMAP"
- "future use cases", "strategic opportunities", "revenue opportunity"
- "who do I contact", "support", "help"
- "security", "compliance", "DLP" (for learning, not configuration)

Behavior:
1. Acknowledge: "Let me connect you with the Documentation Assistant."
2. Hand off to DOCS agent
3. DOCS provides persona-appropriate response
4. DOCS offers return: "Say 'back to planning' when ready."

Do NOT route to DOCS when:
- User wants to create/execute a plan
- User is mid-workflow and asking clarifying questions
- User needs actual agent capabilities executed
