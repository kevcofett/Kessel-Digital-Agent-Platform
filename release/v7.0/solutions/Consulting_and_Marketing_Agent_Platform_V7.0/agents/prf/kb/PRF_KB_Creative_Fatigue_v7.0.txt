PURPOSE

This knowledge base provides the Performance Agent with comprehensive creative fatigue methodology including detection approaches, management strategies, and best practices for maintaining creative effectiveness.

CREATIVE FATIGUE FUNDAMENTALS

Understanding ad creative wear-out.

FATIGUE CONCEPT

What creative fatigue represents.

Definition
- Performance decline over time
- Repeated exposure effect
- Audience disengagement
- Effectiveness reduction

Causes
- Over-exposure
- Familiarity breed contempt
- Attention habituation
- Message saturation

Consequences
- Declining CTR
- Increasing CPA
- Wasted impressions
- Audience annoyance

FATIGUE PATTERNS

Types of creative wear-out.

Gradual decline
- Slow performance erosion
- Steady deterioration
- Predictable pattern
- Early detection possible

Sudden drop
- Rapid performance decline
- Threshold crossing
- Dramatic change
- Urgent response needed

Audience segment variation
- Different fatigue rates
- Segment-specific patterns
- Frequency correlation
- Targeting consideration

FATIGUE DETECTION

Identifying creative wear-out.

PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
