================================================================================
SECTION 2 - MODELED CONVERSIONS
================================================================================

MODELED CONVERSION DEFINITION

Modeled conversions use machine learning to estimate conversions that cannot be directly observed due to privacy restrictions.

HOW MODELING WORKS
1. Observe conversions from consented users
2. Identify patterns and signals
3. Apply model to estimate unobserved
4. Report total (observed + modeled)

PLATFORM APPROACHES

GOOGLE MODELED CONVERSIONS
- Conversion modeling in Google Ads
- Based on consented conversion data
- Applied when cookies blocked
- Included in conversion reporting by default

META MODELED CONVERSIONS
- Aggregated Event Measurement
- Statistical modeling for iOS
- 72-hour reporting delay possible
- Based on conversion patterns

ACCURACY CONSIDERATIONS
- More data improves modeling
- Smaller advertisers may see variance
- Models calibrated continuously
- Compare modeled vs direct where possible

MODELED CONVERSION BEST PRACTICES

IMPROVE MODEL ACCURACY
- Maximize first-party data signals
- Implement Enhanced Conversions
- Use Conversions API
- Maintain conversion volume

INTERPRET WITH CAUTION
- Understand what is modeled vs observed
- Track modeled percentage over time
- Use for directional guidance
- Validate with incrementality tests

================================================================================
SECTION 3 - ENHANCED CONVERSIONS
================================================================================

ENHANCED CONVERSIONS OVERVIEW

Enhanced conversions send hashed first-party data with conversion tags to improve match rates when cookies are unavailable.

DATA TYPES USED
- Email address (most valuable)
- Phone number
- Name and address
- User-provided identifiers

IMPLEMENTATION METHODS

TAG-BASED (GTAG)
- Collect data in conversion tag
- Hash automatically before sending
- Easiest implementation
- Limited to page-level data

API-BASED (CONVERSION API)
- Server-to-server integration
- Full control over data
- More data points possible
- Requires development resources

GOOGLE TAG MANAGER
- Configure in GTM
- Pull from data layer
- Flexible implementation
- Good balance of ease and control

MATCH RATE IMPROVEMENT
- Typical improvement: 10-25%
- Email provides highest match
- Multiple identifiers stack
- Quality of data matters

GOOGLE ENHANCED CONVERSIONS

FOR WEB
- Add user-provided data to conversion tags
- Improves attribution accuracy
- Works with existing conversion tracking
- No changes to bidding required

FOR LEADS
- Upload offline conversion data
- Include hashed identifiers
- Matches to click data
- Closes online-to-offline gap

IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST
1. Audit data collection points
2. Ensure privacy compliance
3. Implement hashing correctly
4. Test with conversion tag assistant
5. Monitor match rate reports

================================================================================
SECTION 4 - AGGREGATED MEASUREMENT
================================================================================

AGGREGATED APPROACH

Aggregated measurement provides insights without individual-level data by reporting on groups rather than users.

PRIVACY BENEFIT
- No individual tracking
- Differential privacy principles
- Thresholds prevent re-identification
- Compliant with privacy regulations

GOOGLE PRIVACY SANDBOX

ATTRIBUTION REPORTING API
- Event-level reports (limited)
- Summary reports (aggregated)
- Configurable attribution
- Noise added for privacy

TOPICS API
- Replaces interest-based targeting
- Browser determines topics locally
- Limited topic taxonomy
- Coarse-grained targeting

PROTECTED AUDIENCES
- On-device interest groups
- Auction runs in browser
- No cross-site tracking
- Replaces third-party audiences

AGGREGATED MEASUREMENT TOOLS

GOOGLE ADS DATA HUB
- Query Google data in clean room
- Aggregate outputs only
- No individual export
- Advanced analysis possible

META ADVANCED ANALYTICS
- Aggregated insights
- Privacy thresholds applied
- Cross-platform measurement
- Limited to Meta ecosystem

PLATFORM AGGREGATED APIS
- Platform-specific implementations
- Require technical integration
- Output is anonymized
- Useful for advanced measurement

================================================================================
SECTION 5 - SKAN AND MOBILE MEASUREMENT
================================================================================

SKADNETWORK (SKAN) OVERVIEW

Apple framework for measuring iOS app install campaigns without user-level tracking.

SKAN MECHANICS
1. User sees ad and installs app
2. App registers attribution
3. Timer runs (24-72 hours)
4. Postback sent to ad network
5. Postback includes conversion value

SKAN VERSIONS

SKAN 3.0
- Single postback
- 6-bit conversion value (0-63)
- 24-hour timer minimum
- Limited campaign granularity

SKAN 4.0
- Three postbacks over time
- Coarse and fine conversion values
- Crowd anonymity tiers
- Hierarchical source identifiers
- Web-to-app attribution

CONVERSION VALUE STRATEGY

CONVERSION VALUE SCHEMA
Map 0-63 values to business outcomes:
- Revenue buckets
- Event combinations
- Engagement tiers

SCHEMA DESIGN
1. Identify most valuable events
2. Prioritize revenue information
3. Account for timer constraints
4. Balance granularity vs volume

EXAMPLE SCHEMA
- 0: Install only
- 1-10: Registration completed
- 11-30: First purchase (revenue buckets)
- 31-50: Repeat purchase
- 51-63: High-value actions

COARSE VALUES (SKAN 4)
- Low: Basic engagement
- Medium: Moderate value
- High: High value
- Applied when privacy thresholds not met

SKAN OPTIMIZATION

CONVERSION VALUE MAPPING
- Work with MMPs for schema
- Test and iterate schema
- Monitor null rates
- Adjust for business changes

CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE
- Consolidate campaigns (more data per campaign)
- Use hierarchical IDs effectively
- Accept some granularity loss
- Focus on portfolio performance

================================================================================
SECTION 6 - PRIVACY-PRESERVING ATTRIBUTION
================================================================================

INCREMENTALITY-FIRST APPROACH

Given measurement limitations, incrementality testing becomes more important.

INCREMENTALITY BENEFITS
- No user-level tracking required
- Measures true causal impact
- Works across privacy restrictions
- Validates platform reporting

INCREMENTALITY METHODS

GEO EXPERIMENTS
- Holdout geographic regions
- Compare test vs control
- No individual tracking needed
- Gold standard for incrementality

CONVERSION LIFT STUDIES
- Platform-managed experiments
- Randomized user holdouts
- Aggregated reporting
- Available from major platforms

GHOST BIDDING
- Bid but do not serve to control
- Measures true incrementality
- Requires DSP capability
- Growing in adoption

MULTI-TOUCH ATTRIBUTION EVOLUTION

MTA CHALLENGES
- Requires user-level data
- Cross-site tracking breaking
- Accuracy declining
- Privacy non-compliant

MTA ALTERNATIVES
- Incrementality testing
- Marketing Mix Modeling
- Unified measurement frameworks
- Platform-reported attribution

UNIFIED MEASUREMENT

TRIANGULATION APPROACH
1. Platform attribution (directional)
2. MMM (strategic allocation)
3. Incrementality (validation)
4. Reconcile across methods

FRAMEWORK CONSTRUCTION
- Use MMM for budget allocation
- Use incrementality for validation
- Use platform data for optimization
- Accept imperfection, seek consistency

================================================================================
SECTION 7 - FIRST-PARTY DATA STRATEGY
================================================================================

FIRST-PARTY DATA IMPORTANCE

First-party data becomes essential as third-party signals decline.

DATA TYPES
- Customer transaction data
- Website behavior (with consent)
- CRM and email engagement

COLLECTION STRATEGY

VALUE EXCHANGE
- Offer clear benefit for data sharing
- Personalization, discounts, content
- Transparent about data use
- Easy preference management

CONSENT MANAGEMENT

- Granular preferences
- Easy withdrawal
- Compliant storage

FIRST-PARTY ACTIVATION

CUSTOMER MATCH

- Target or suppress across platforms
- Match rates: 40-70% typical
- Refresh regularly

ENHANCED CONVERSIONS
- Attach first-party IDs to conversions
- Improve attribution accuracy
- Close measurement gaps
- Requires implementation

SERVER-SIDE TRACKING
- First-party cookies more durable
- Server-side tag management
- Better data control
- More implementation effort
