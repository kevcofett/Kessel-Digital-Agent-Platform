PURPOSE

This document provides guidance on sustainable advertising practices within programmatic supply paths. Reference when users ask about carbon footprint, green media initiatives, or environmental considerations in media buying.

SUSTAINABILITY IN DIGITAL ADVERTISING

THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF ADS

Digital advertising has a measurable environmental impact through energy consumption across the supply chain.

Scope 3 Emissions:
Digital advertising contributes to Scope 3 (indirect) emissions for advertisers. While not directly controlled, these emissions are increasingly scrutinized by stakeholders and regulators.

Where Emissions Occur:
- Ad servers processing bid requests and responses
- Data centers storing and serving creative assets
- Network infrastructure transferring data
- SSP and DSP platforms processing auctions
- Verification and measurement servers
- End-user devices rendering ads

Scale of Impact:
- Estimated 1 million ad impressions produces 1+ metric tons CO2
- Global digital advertising produces millions of tons annually
- Programmatic supply chains multiply the impact
- Inefficient supply paths can 10x carbon cost

INDUSTRY INITIATIVES

Ad Net Zero:
- Industry commitment to net zero by 2030
- Five-point action plan for advertisers
- Measurement standards development
- Supported by major agencies and brands

GARM Sustainability Framework:
- Global Alliance for Responsible Media
- Extends beyond brand safety to sustainability
- Working group on measurement standards
- Industry alignment on methodology

Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi):
- Corporate emission reduction commitments
- Increasingly includes Scope 3 advertising
- Requires measurement and reduction plans
- Growing advertiser adoption

CARBON MEASUREMENT

MEASUREMENT APPROACHES

Emissions Per Impression:
- Standard unit for comparison
- Typically measured in grams CO2e per 1000 impressions
- Enables campaign-level carbon tracking
- Varies significantly by supply path

Campaign-Level Measurement:
- Total impressions x emissions factor
- Accounts for creative weight and format
- Includes supply chain complexity
- Provides actionable campaign metrics

Vendor-Specific Measurement:
- Some vendors provide carbon estimates
- Methodology varies by provider
- Emerging standardization efforts
- Request methodology documentation

KEY FACTORS AFFECTING EMISSIONS

Supply Chain Length:
Longer supply chains have higher emissions.
- Direct publisher: 1x baseline
- One intermediary: 1.5x baseline
- Multiple intermediaries: 2-3x baseline
- Unknown paths: highest emissions

Server Locations and Energy:
Data center energy source matters significantly.
- Renewable-powered: lowest emissions
- Mixed grid: moderate emissions
- Fossil-fuel dependent: highest emissions
- Geographic routing can be optimized

Creative Weight and Format:
Heavier creatives require more energy.
- Static display: lowest emissions
- HTML5/rich media: moderate emissions
- Standard video: higher emissions
- High-resolution video: highest emissions

Viewability and Waste:
Non-viewable impressions are pure waste.
- Viewable impression: justified emission
- Non-viewable impression: wasted emission
- MFA inventory: high waste, high emissions
- Attention correlates with justified spend

BENCHMARKS

Industry Average Emissions:
- Programmatic display: 0.5-2.0g CO2e per impression
- Programmatic video: 2.0-5.0g CO2e per impression
- Direct-sold display: 0.3-1.0g CO2e per impression
- Direct-sold video: 1.0-3.0g CO2e per impression

Improvement Targets:
- 20% reduction achievable through supply path optimization
- 30% reduction achievable with creative optimization
- 50% reduction achievable through comprehensive approach
- Track year-over-year improvement

GREEN SUPPLY PATH OPTIMIZATION

SUPPLY CHAIN EFFICIENCY

Fewer Hops Equals Lower Emissions:
- Direct paths minimize server requests
- Each intermediary adds processing
- Reseller paths highest carbon cost
- Prioritize Tier 1 direct paths

Working Media Connection:
Higher working media percentages correlate with lower emissions per delivered impression. Fee leakage often occurs at carbon-intensive intermediaries.

Supply Path Prioritization:
1. Direct publisher relationships (lowest carbon)
2. Single-hop programmatic (moderate carbon)
3. Verified multi-hop (higher carbon)
4. Open exchange (highest carbon)

DATA CENTER CONSIDERATIONS

Renewable Energy Usage:
- Ask partners about energy sourcing
- Look for RE100 commitment
- Prioritize vendors with renewable certificates
- Geographic considerations for data routing

Geographic Efficiency:
- Data centers closer to users reduce transmission
- Regional buying can reduce carbon
- Balance with inventory availability
- Consider creative CDN locations

Vendor Commitments:
- Google Cloud: carbon neutral since 2007
- Amazon AWS: 100% renewable commitment
- Microsoft Azure: carbon negative commitment
- Ask DSP/SSP partners about infrastructure

CREATIVE OPTIMIZATION

File Size Reduction:
- Compress images without quality loss
- Optimize video encoding
- Use modern formats (WebP, AV1)
- Set maximum file size standards

Format Efficiency:
- Static formats lower than animated
- HTML5 lower than video for engagement
- Consider efficiency in format selection
- Balance impact with sustainability

Creative Best Practices:
- Target file sizes under 150KB for display
- Video compression to minimum viable quality
- Lazy loading for below-fold placements
- Efficient animation techniques

ATTENTION AND WASTE

Higher Attention Equals Less Waste:
Impressions that capture attention deliver value. Low-attention impressions are environmental and financial waste.

Viewability Standards:
- MRC viewability minimum (50% in view, 1 second)
- GroupM viewability (100% in view, 1 second)
- Attention-based viewability (time in view)
- Higher standards reduce waste

MFA Avoidance:
Made-for-advertising sites are carbon-intensive due to:
- High ad loads per page
- Low attention per impression
- Refresh-based impression farming
- Serving ads unlikely to be seen

VENDOR EVALUATION

SUSTAINABILITY CRITERIA

Questions to Ask Partners:
- What is your carbon footprint per impression?
- Do you use renewable energy?
- What are your sustainability commitments?
- Can you provide emissions reporting?
- Do you have third-party certification?

Certifications to Look For:
- Ad Net Zero signatory
- Science Based Targets commitment
- Carbon neutral certification
- Renewable energy certification
- B Corp status
