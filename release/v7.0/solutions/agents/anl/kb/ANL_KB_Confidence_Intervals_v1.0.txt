PURPOSE

This knowledge base provides the Analytics Agent with comprehensive confidence interval methodology including construction approaches, interpretation guidelines, and best practices for uncertainty quantification.

CONFIDENCE INTERVAL FUNDAMENTALS

Understanding uncertainty quantification.

CONFIDENCE INTERVAL CONCEPT

What confidence intervals represent.

Interval definition
- Range of plausible values
- Point estimate plus uncertainty
- Lower and upper bounds
- Width indicates precision

Confidence level
- Probability interpretation
- Common levels 90 95 99
- Trade-off with width
- Decision alignment

Interpretation
- Repeated sampling concept
- Coverage probability
- Not probability of parameter
- Frequentist interpretation

CI VERSUS CREDIBLE INTERVALS

Frequentist versus Bayesian.

Confidence intervals
- Frequentist approach
- Repeated sampling
- Fixed parameter
- Random interval

Credible intervals
- Bayesian approach
- Probability of parameter
- Random parameter
- Fixed interval

Practical differences
- Interpretation nuance
- Prior incorporation
- Decision making
- Communication choice

CONSTRUCTION METHODS

Building confidence intervals.

NORMAL-BASED INTERVALS

Large sample intervals.

Z-interval construction
- Known variance
- Normal distribution
- Point estimate plus margin
- Z critical value

T-interval construction
- Unknown variance
- T distribution
- Sample standard error
- T critical value

Large sample approximation
- Central limit theorem
- Sample size requirements
- Asymptotic normality
- Practical conditions

BOOTSTRAP INTERVALS

Resampling-based intervals.

Bootstrap concept
- Resample with replacement
- Empirical distribution
- Distribution-free
- Nonparametric

Bootstrap percentile
- Quantiles of bootstrap distribution
- Simple interpretation
- Bias possible
- Most common method

Bootstrap BCa
- Bias-corrected accelerated
- Adjusts for bias and skewness
- More accurate
- Computationally intensive

BAYESIAN INTERVALS

Posterior-based intervals.

Credible interval construction
- Posterior distribution
- Quantile-based
- Equal-tailed
- Highest density

HPD intervals
- Highest posterior density
- Shortest interval
- Density-based
- Asymmetric possible

Posterior predictive
- Future observation interval
- Incorporates parameter uncertainty
- Prediction focus
- Wider than parameter interval

INTERVAL INTERPRETATION

Understanding and communicating intervals.

PROPER INTERPRETATION

Correct interval understanding.

Confidence level meaning
- Long-run coverage
- Repeated sampling
- Procedure property
- Not specific interval probability

Width interpretation
- Precision indicator
- Uncertainty magnitude
- Sample size relationship
- Variability dependence

Overlap interpretation
- Significance inference
- Conservative for difference
- Visual comparison
- Formal test preferred

COMMON MISINTERPRETATIONS

Avoiding incorrect conclusions.

Probability misinterpretation
- Not probability parameter in interval
- Not Bayesian posterior
- Frequentist concept
- Careful communication

Certainty misinterpretation
- Does not guarantee coverage
- One-interval realization
- Unknown if correct
- Uncertainty remains

MARKETING APPLICATIONS

Confidence intervals in marketing analytics.

PERFORMANCE INTERVALS

Metric uncertainty.

Conversion rate intervals
- Proportion interval
- Wilson interval preferred
- Sample size impact
- Decision confidence

Mean value intervals
- Transaction value
- Order value
- Customer value
- Estimation precision

Rate comparison intervals
- Difference of proportions
- Treatment effect
- A/B test results
- Significance assessment

PROJECTION INTERVALS

Forecast uncertainty.

Point prediction intervals
- Future value range
- Prediction versus confidence
- Horizon impact
- Uncertainty growth

Budget projection intervals
- Spend forecasts
- Revenue predictions
- ROI estimates
- Planning ranges

SAMPLE SIZE AND WIDTH

Interval precision factors.

SAMPLE SIZE IMPACT

How sample size affects width.

Width relationship
- Inversely proportional to square root
- Larger sample narrower interval
- Precision improvement rate
- Diminishing returns

Sample size determination
- Target width specification
- Required precision
- Confidence level
- Variability estimate

VARIANCE IMPACT

How variability affects width.

Variance role
- Direct proportionality
- Higher variance wider interval
- Estimate precision
- Data quality importance

Variance reduction
- Stratification
- Covariate adjustment
- Better measurement
- Sample design

CONFIDENCE LEVEL TRADEOFF

Level versus width balance.

Higher confidence
- Wider intervals
- More coverage certainty
- Less precision
- Conservative inference

Lower confidence
- Narrower intervals
- Less coverage certainty
- More precision
- Risk of missed coverage

MULTIPLE INTERVALS

Handling multiple comparisons.

MULTIPLE COMPARISON ISSUE

Why multiple intervals matter.

Family-wise error
- Multiple interval construction
- Coverage probability decline
- False discovery
- Inflation problem

Simultaneous coverage
- All intervals correct
- Joint probability
- Lower than individual
- Adjustment needed

ADJUSTMENT METHODS

Correcting for multiplicity.

Bonferroni adjustment
- Divide alpha by number
- Conservative approach
- Simple implementation
- Wider intervals

Hochberg adjustment
- Less conservative
- Step-up procedure
- Power improvement
- Common choice
