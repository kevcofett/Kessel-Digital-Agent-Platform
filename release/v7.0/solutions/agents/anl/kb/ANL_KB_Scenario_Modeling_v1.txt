SECTION 1 - SCENARIO MODELING FUNDAMENTALS
================================================================================

PURPOSE AND APPROACH

Scenario modeling enables exploration of what-if questions and sensitivity analysis for media planning decisions. The agent MUST present multiple scenarios to help users understand the range of possible outcomes.

STANDARD SCENARIO FRAMEWORK

Every projection MUST include three scenarios:

CONSERVATIVE SCENARIO
- 80th percentile downside
- Assumes lower-than-expected performance
- Uses pessimistic benchmark values
- Accounts for potential headwinds

BASE SCENARIO
- Expected outcome at median probability
- Uses most likely benchmark values
- Represents realistic planning target
- Primary scenario for budgeting

OPTIMISTIC SCENARIO
- 80th percentile upside
- Assumes better-than-expected performance
- Uses strong benchmark values
- Represents stretch targets

SCENARIO REQUIREMENTS

For each scenario include:
- Key metric projections with calculations shown
- Assumptions that differ between scenarios
- Confidence level for the scenario
- Risk factors that could shift results

SECTION 2 - SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
================================================================================

SINGLE VARIABLE SENSITIVITY

Test impact of changing one variable while holding others constant.

PROCESS
1. Identify key input variables
2. Define reasonable range for each variable
3. Calculate outcome at low, base, and high values
4. Rank variables by impact on outcome

KEY VARIABLES FOR ANALYSIS
- CPM (cost per thousand)
- CTR (click-through rate)
- CVR (conversion rate)
- AOV (average order value)
- Budget level

MULTI-VARIABLE SENSITIVITY

Test impact of changing multiple variables simultaneously.

MONTE CARLO SIMULATION
1. Define probability distributions for key inputs
2. Run thousands of simulations with random draws
3. Analyze distribution of outcomes
4. Calculate confidence intervals

TORNADO DIAGRAM ANALYSIS
1. Calculate outcome impact for each variable at extremes
2. Rank variables by magnitude of impact
3. Present as horizontal bar chart (tornado shape)
4. Focus optimization on highest-impact variables

================================================================================
SECTION 3 - WHAT-IF ANALYSIS PATTERNS
================================================================================

BUDGET WHAT-IF

What happens if budget increases by X percent?

CALCULATION
New_Budget = Current_Budget x (1 + X/100)
New_Impressions = New_Budget x 1000 / CPM
Apply response curve for diminishing returns
New_Conversions = Response_Curve(New_Impressions)

CONSIDERATIONS
- Acknowledge diminishing returns at higher spend
- Check channel saturation levels
- Evaluate if additional spend crosses minimum thresholds

TIMELINE WHAT-IF

What happens if campaign duration changes?

CALCULATION
Impact depends on scheduling strategy:
- Continuous: Proportional to duration change
- Flighting: Affects number of flights or flight length
- Pulsing: Affects baseline or pulse intensity

CONSIDERATIONS
- Shorter campaigns may miss learning period
- Longer campaigns benefit from optimization
- Seasonality affects timing decisions

CHANNEL MIX WHAT-IF

What happens if we shift budget between channels?

CALCULATION
1. Calculate marginal ROI for each channel
2. Shift from low marginal ROI to high marginal ROI
3. Recalculate total projected outcome
4. Continue until marginal ROIs equalize

CONSIDERATIONS
- Check minimum spend thresholds
- Account for channel-specific saturation
- Consider cross-channel synergies

SECTION 4 - CUSTOMER VALUE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

LTV SCENARIO MODELING

MODEL INPUTS
- Frequency: Number of repeat purchases
- Recency: Time since most recent purchase
- Monetary: Average transaction value
- Retention rate by period
- Discount rate for NPV calculation

SCENARIO VARIATIONS

CONSERVATIVE LTV
- Lower retention rate (base minus 10 percent)
- Lower monetary value (base minus 15 percent)
- Higher discount rate

BASE LTV
- Historical retention rate
- Historical monetary value
- Standard discount rate

OPTIMISTIC LTV
- Higher retention rate (base plus 5 percent)
- Higher monetary value (base plus 10 percent)
- Lower discount rate

LTV TO CAC RATIO INTERPRETATION

RATIO LESS THAN 1.0
- Losing money on every customer
- Unsustainable business model
- Immediate action required

RATIO 1.0 TO 2.0
- Marginally profitable
- Limited room for error
- Consider improving retention or reducing CAC

RATIO 2.0 TO 3.0
- Healthy business
- Room for growth investment
- Standard target for most businesses

RATIO 3.0 TO 5.0
- Strong unit economics
- Opportunity to invest more in acquisition
- May be underinvesting in growth

RATIO GREATER THAN 5.0
- Excellent economics
- Consider aggressive growth investment
- Evaluate if underinvesting in acquisition

================================================================================
SECTION 5 - COHORT AND RETENTION SCENARIOS
================================================================================

RETENTION CURVE MODELING

EXPONENTIAL DECAY
Retention(t) = exp(-lambda x t)
Constant churn rate each period.

POWER LAW DECAY
Retention(t) = t^(-alpha)
Churn rate decreases over time (common in practice).

FIVE-YEAR LIFECYCLE FORECASTING

YEAR 1
- Month 1-3: Acquisition and onboarding (high churn)
- Month 4-12: Stabilization (moderate churn)
- Year 1 Survival Estimate: 20-35 percent typical

YEAR 2
- Month 13-24: Retention normalization
- Churn rate typically stabilizes
- Year 2 Survival Estimate: 15-25 percent (of original)

YEAR 3-5
- Month 25-60: Mature customer base
- Low, stable churn rates
- Year 5 Survival Estimate: 8-18 percent (of original)

COHORT LTV FORMULA
Cohort_LTV = Sum of (Retention_Rate_t x ARPU_t x Discount_Factor_t) for t = 1 to 60

SECTION 6 - SECONDARY EFFECTS AND GUARDRAILS
================================================================================

TYPES OF SECONDARY EFFECTS

SPILLOVER EFFECTS
Positive impact on related metrics not directly targeted.
Example: Brand campaign increases both awareness and direct response.

CANNIBALIZATION
Improvement in one area causes decline in another.
Example: Promotion steals sales from full-price period.

HALO EFFECTS
Indirect positive effects on brand or related products.
Example: Advertising for flagship product lifts entire brand.

GUARDRAIL METRICS

DEFINITION
Secondary KPIs monitored during tests to detect unintended negative impacts.

CATEGORIES

BUSINESS HEALTH
- Revenue
- Conversions
- Customer lifetime value

USER EXPERIENCE
- Page load time
- Error rates
- Bounce rates

QUALITY
- Customer satisfaction
- Support ticket volume
- Refund rates

GUARDRAIL THRESHOLDS

GREEN (All Clear)
- Guardrail change statistically insignificant
- Or change is positive
- Proceed with shipping decision

YELLOW (Caution)
- Guardrail trending negative but not significant
- Or small negative significant change
- Review with stakeholders before shipping

RED (Stop)
- Significant negative change exceeding threshold
- Pause experiment immediately
- Investigate root cause before proceeding

SECTION 7 - SCENARIO FORMULAS
================================================================================

RFM ANALYSIS FORMULAS
Recency = Today_Date - Last_Purchase_Date (days)
Frequency = Count of Transactions in Period
Monetary = Sum of Transaction Values in Period
RFM_Score = R_Score + F_Score + M_Score

LIFETIME VALUE FORMULAS
Simple_LTV = Average_Revenue_Per_Customer x Customer_Lifespan
Traditional_CLV = (Margin x Retention) / (1 + Discount_Rate - Retention)
LTV_to_CAC = Customer_Lifetime_Value / Customer_Acquisition_Cost
CAC_Payback_Months = CAC / Monthly_Margin_Per_Customer

COHORT ANALYSIS FORMULAS
Retention_Rate_t = Active_Customers_t / Original_Cohort_Size
Survival_Function = Product of (1 - Churn_Rate_i) for i = 1 to t
Churn_Rate = Churned_Customers / Starting_Customers
Average_Customer_Lifespan = 1 / Churn_Rate
