- Email engagement
Value: Highest accuracy, known customers
Typical match rates: 50-80 percent

TIER 2 - SECOND-PARTY DATA
- Partner data sharing
- Data co-ops
- Publisher data
Value: High relevance, verified by partner
Typical match rates: 40-60 percent

TIER 3 - PLATFORM NATIVE DATA
- Platform behavioral signals
- In-platform interest categories
- Engagement history on platform
Value: Fresh, platform-optimized
No match rate (native)

TIER 4 - THIRD-PARTY DATA
- Data provider segments
- Purchased audience data
- Aggregated behavioral data
Value: Scale, but variable accuracy
Typical accuracy: 50-70 percent

TIER 5 - CONTEXTUAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC
- Content alignment
- Demographic inference

Value: Privacy-safe, broad reach
No personal data required

SECTION 2 - LOOKALIKE AUDIENCE STRATEGY
================================================================================

SEED AUDIENCE QUALITY

SEED SIZE RECOMMENDATIONS
- Minimum viable: 1,000 customers
- Good foundation: 5,000-10,000 customers
- Optimal: 10,000-50,000 customers
- Diminishing returns above: 100,000 customers

SEED QUALITY FACTORS
- Recency: Recent converters perform better
- Value: High-LTV seeds produce high-LTV lookalikes
- Consistency: Homogeneous seeds produce tighter matches
- Uniqueness: Distinctive behaviors improve matching

SEED SELECTION GUIDANCE

BEST SEEDS FOR ACQUISITION
- Recent purchasers (last 90 days)
- High-LTV customers (top 20 percent)
- Multi-purchase customers (2 plus orders)
- High engagement (email openers, app users)

AVOID AS SEEDS
- One-time discount buyers (not representative)
- Very old customers (stale signals)
- Outliers (skew the model)
- Churned customers (wrong patterns)

EXPANSION THRESHOLDS

EXPANSION 1 PERCENT
- Highest similarity to seed
- Smallest reach
- Best for: High-margin products, limited budget
- Expected performance: 90-100 percent of seed performance

EXPANSION 1-3 PERCENT
- Very similar to seed
- Moderate reach
- Best for: Balanced campaigns
- Expected performance: 70-90 percent of seed performance

EXPANSION 3-5 PERCENT
- Similar to seed with some variance
- Good reach
- Best for: Scale campaigns
- Expected performance: 50-70 percent of seed performance

EXPANSION 5-10 PERCENT
- Broader similarity
- Large reach
- Best for: Awareness, top-of-funnel
- Expected performance: 30-50 percent of seed performance

EXPANSION ABOVE 10 PERCENT
- Diminishing similarity
- Very large reach
- Best for: Mass awareness only
- Expected performance: Approaching average population

PLATFORM-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE

META LOOKALIKES
- Uses broad signals including off-platform
- Refresh seed monthly for best results
- Value-based lookalikes outperform count-based
- Test 1 percent vs 3 percent vs 5 percent

GOOGLE SIMILAR AUDIENCES
- Based on search and browse behavior
- Requires 1,000 plus seed minimum
- Auto-refreshes with new converters
- Combine with in-market for intent

AMAZON AUDIENCES
- Based on shopping and browse behavior
- Strong purchase intent signals
- Best for retail and CPG
- Minimum 2,000 seed recommended

SECTION 6 - TARGETING FORMULAS
================================================================================

AUDIENCE SIZE CALCULATIONS

Addressable_Audience = Total_Population x Match_Rate x Targeting_Overlap
Effective_Reach = Addressable_Audience x Expected_Win_Rate
Required_Budget = Effective_Reach x Expected_CPM / 1000

OVERLAP CALCULATIONS

Overlap_Rate = Matched_in_Both / Smaller_Audience_Size
Incremental_Reach = Audience_B - (Audience_B x Overlap_Rate)
Combined_Reach = Audience_A + Incremental_Reach

FREQUENCY CALCULATIONS

Average_Frequency = Total_Impressions / Unique_Reach
Effective_Frequency = Impressions_at_Optimal_Level / Unique_Reach
Frequency_Distribution = Count_at_Each_Level / Total_Reached

EFFICIENCY CALCULATIONS

Audience_Efficiency = Conversions_from_Segment / Impressions_to_Segment
Targeting_Lift = Segment_CVR / Average_CVR
Cost_per_Reached = Total_Spend / Unique_Reach
