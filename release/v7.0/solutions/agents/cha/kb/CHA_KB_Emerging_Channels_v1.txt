PURPOSE

This document provides guidance on rapidly evolving media channels. Reference when users ask about CTV strategy, retail media networks, digital out-of-home, or other emerging platforms.

CONNECTED TV (CTV) ADVANCED

BUYING APPROACHES

Direct with Publishers:
- Negotiate directly with streaming services
- Premium inventory access
- Guaranteed placements
- Higher CPMs but quality assured
- Examples: Hulu direct, Peacock direct, Max direct

Programmatic CTV:
- Access through DSPs
- Real-time bidding on impressions
- Broader reach, variable quality
- Typical CPMs: 20-40 dollars
- Platforms: TTD, DV360, Amazon DSP

Platform-Direct:
- Buy through streaming platform interfaces
- Self-serve options available
- Targeting uses platform first-party data
- Examples: Roku OneView, Samsung Ads, LG Ads

Premium vs Long-Tail Inventory:
- Premium: Top 50 streaming apps, known content
- Mid-tier: Emerging apps, FAST channels
- Long-tail: Aggregators, unknown sources
- Recommendation: Start premium, test expansion

TARGETING CAPABILITIES

ACR (Automatic Content Recognition) Data:
- Tracks what content plays on smart TVs
- Enables targeting based on viewing habits
- Available from: Samsung, LG, Vizio, Roku
- Privacy considerations increasing

First-Party Data:
- Streaming service subscriber data
- Viewing history and preferences
- Demographic information
- Purchase behavior (where applicable)

Contextual Targeting:
- Target by content genre
- Target by content mood or theme
- Avoid adjacency to sensitive content
- Growing importance with privacy changes

Cross-Device Identity:
- Link CTV to mobile and desktop
- Enable retargeting from CTV exposure
- Providers: LiveRamp, TransUnion, Experian
- Accuracy varies, test match rates

MEASUREMENT CHALLENGES

Attribution Windows:
- CTV often awareness driver, not direct response
- Standard 7-day click window insufficient
- Recommend 14-30 day view-through window
- Consider full-funnel impact

View-Through Considerations:
- Most CTV impressions do not generate clicks
- View-through attribution essential
- Risk of over-attribution exists
- Use incrementality testing to validate

Incrementality Testing:
- Geo-experiments work well for CTV
- Holdout testing possible with some platforms
- Look for lift in search and direct traffic
- Measure brand lift as intermediate metric

FREQUENCY MANAGEMENT

Cross-Platform Deduplication:
- Same user watches multiple apps
- Without deduplication, frequency explodes
- Use identity solutions for capping
- Accept some over-delivery without solution

Household vs Individual:
- CTV targets household, not person
- Multiple viewers per device
- Frequency caps should account for this
- Typical recommendation: 3-5x per week per HH

MINIMUM BUDGETS AND SCALE

Platform Minimums:
- Hulu: 25,000 dollars minimum
- Peacock: 15,000 dollars minimum
