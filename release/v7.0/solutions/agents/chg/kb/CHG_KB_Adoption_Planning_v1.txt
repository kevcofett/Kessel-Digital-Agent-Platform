CHG KNOWLEDGE BASE - ADOPTION AND ROLLOUT PLANNING

OVERVIEW

Adoption planning transforms change initiatives from concepts into reality. This knowledge base covers the practical elements of deploying change across organizations including rollout strategy, training approaches, change network establishment, sustainment mechanisms, metrics, and risk mitigation.

ROLLOUT STRATEGY

Big Bang Versus Phased Rollout

Big Bang Approach
- Full deployment to entire organization at once
- All users transition on same date
- Single concentrated effort for implementation

When to Use Big Bang
- System dependencies require simultaneous cutover
- Change is relatively simple to implement
- Organization has strong change capability
- Risk of running parallel systems is high
- Urgency requires rapid deployment

Big Bang Benefits
- Clear single transition date
- No extended parallel operations
- Full resources focused on one event
- Consistent experience across organization
- Lower total cost in some scenarios

Big Bang Risks
- High stakes single event
- Limited opportunity to learn and adjust
- Resource surge requirements
- Greater impact if issues occur
- Stress concentration on support teams

Phased Approach
- Gradual deployment across groups or locations
- Sequential waves of implementation
- Learning from early phases informs later ones

When to Use Phased
- Change is complex with many variables
- Risk tolerance is low
- Resources are constrained
- Learning opportunity is valuable
- Political considerations favor gradualism

Phased Benefits
- Lower risk per deployment wave
- Opportunity to refine approach
- Earlier adopters support later ones
- Resource demand spread over time
- Ability to demonstrate success early

Phased Risks
- Extended timeline and fatigue
- Inconsistent state during transition
- Early phases may resist being guinea pigs
- Later phases may resist waiting
- Complexity managing multiple states

Pilot Selection Criteria

Characteristics of Good Pilots
- Representative of broader population
- Sufficient scale to generate meaningful data
- Leadership willing to participate
- Team capable of providing quality feedback
- Manageable complexity for initial deployment

Pilot Selection Factors
- Organizational readiness level
- Change champion presence
- Technical infrastructure readiness
- Business criticality and risk tolerance
- Geographic and functional diversity

Pilot Scope Considerations
- Large enough to test real scenarios
- Small enough to manage closely
- Duration sufficient to observe patterns
- Include edge cases and exceptions
- Enable meaningful measurement

Geographic Versus Functional Rollout

Geographic Sequencing
- Deploy by location or region
- Complete implementation in one area before next
- Useful when locations operate independently
- Enables local support concentration

Functional Sequencing
- Deploy by department or function
- Complete implementation across one function first
- Useful when functions have distinct needs
- Enables specialized support focus

Hybrid Approaches
- Combine geographic and functional dimensions
- Pilot with single function in single location
- Expand along one dimension then the other
- Adapt based on organizational structure

Timing Considerations

Calendar Factors
- Avoid peak business periods
- Consider fiscal calendar impacts
- Account for holiday and vacation patterns
- Align with organizational planning cycles

Dependency Factors
- Prerequisite changes completed first
- Related initiatives coordinated
- Resource availability across efforts
- External deadline requirements

Organizational Factors
- Leadership bandwidth and attention
- Change fatigue from other initiatives
- Political climate and priorities
- Morale and engagement levels

TRAINING APPROACH

Training Needs Assessment

Assessment Dimensions

- Format and timing recommendations
- Success criteria for training outcomes

Delivery Methods

Instructor-Led Training
- Facilitated sessions with expert trainers
- Interactive with real-time Q&A
- Hands-on exercises and practice
- Suitable for complex or sensitive content

When to Use Instructor-Led
- Content is complex requiring explanation
- Audience needs hands-on practice
- Questions and dialogue are valuable
- Building relationships is important
- Compliance requires documented attendance

Instructor-Led Considerations
- Higher cost per participant
- Scheduling coordination required
- Trainer capacity constraints
- Venue and logistics needs
- Travel for distributed audiences

E-Learning

- Large audience spread across locations
- Consistency of delivery is important
- Self-paced learning is appropriate
- Cost efficiency is priority

E-Learning Considerations
- Requires technology access
- Lower completion rates without enforcement
- Limited interaction and clarification
- Not suitable for all learning styles
- Development time and cost upfront

Blended Learning
- Combination of instructor-led and e-learning
- E-learning for foundation knowledge
- Instructor-led for application and practice
- Optimizes benefits of both approaches

Blended Design Principles
- Use e-learning for knowledge transfer
- Use instructor-led for skill application
- Sequence logically for learner experience
- Minimize redundancy across modalities
- Enable flexibility in completion path
