PROGRAMMATIC FACTORS

SUPPLY PATH COMPLEXITY
Longer supply paths with more intermediaries increase emissions. Each hop adds:
- Additional server processing
- Network transmission
- Data storage and retrieval

RESELLING AND DUPLICATION
Inventory resold multiple times multiplies emissions without adding value. Focus on direct publisher relationships.

BID VOLUME
High bid-to-win ratios waste energy on unsuccessful auctions. Optimize bidding efficiency to reduce speculative processing.

================================================================================
SECTION 4 - REDUCTION STRATEGIES
================================================================================

SUPPLY PATH OPTIMIZATION

DIRECT PUBLISHER RELATIONSHIPS
Prioritize direct paths to publishers over resold inventory. Reduces intermediary processing and associated emissions.

SPO FOR CARBON
Apply supply path optimization principles with carbon as key factor:
- Prefer SSPs with shorter paths to publishers
- Reduce number of bid requests sent
- Consolidate spend with efficient partners

TECH STACK EFFICIENCY
- Minimize number of platforms in execution chain
- Choose partners with renewable energy commitments
- Prefer data centers in low-carbon grid regions

MEDIA SELECTION OPTIMIZATION

CARBON-WEIGHTED PLANNING
Include emissions as factor in media selection alongside performance and cost.

Carbon_Adjusted_CPM = CPM x (1 + Carbon_Factor)

CHANNEL PRIORITIZATION
When performance equivalent, prioritize lower-emission channels:
- Text over rich media where appropriate
- Shorter video lengths when effective
- Static over animated formats

GEOGRAPHIC CONSIDERATIONS
Grid carbon intensity varies significantly by region. Where targeting allows, weight toward lower-carbon grids.

CREATIVE OPTIMIZATION

FILE SIZE REDUCTION
Smaller files require less energy to transmit and render:
- Optimize image compression
- Reduce video bitrates where quality maintained
- Minimize JavaScript payload

VIDEO EFFICIENCY
- Shorter video lengths reduce streaming emissions
- Lower resolution where appropriate for placement
- Efficient codecs reduce file sizes

DYNAMIC CREATIVE EFFICIENCY
- Minimize unnecessary personalization variations
- Cache commonly used components
- Reduce real-time rendering requirements
