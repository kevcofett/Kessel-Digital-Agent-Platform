SECTION 8 - FEE ANALYSIS FORMULAS
================================================================================

CORE CALCULATIONS

Working_Media_Ratio = Publisher_Payment / Total_Spend x 100
Fee_Stack_Total = 100 - Working_Media_Ratio
Effective_CPM = Total_Spend / (Impressions / 1000)
True_Publisher_CPM = Publisher_Payment / (Impressions / 1000)

LAYER-BY-LAYER ANALYSIS

Post_Agency = Total_Spend x (1 - Agency_Fee_Pct)
Post_DSP = Post_Agency x (1 - DSP_Fee_Pct)
Post_Data = Post_DSP - (Impressions / 1000 x Data_CPM)
Post_Verification = Post_Data - (Impressions / 1000 x Verification_CPM)
Publisher_Payment = Post_Verification x (1 - SSP_Fee_Pct)

EFFICIENCY METRICS

Fee_Efficiency_Index = Working_Media_Ratio / Industry_Average
Optimization_Potential = Target_Working_Media - Current_Working_Media
Annual_Savings = Optimization_Potential x Annual_Spend
