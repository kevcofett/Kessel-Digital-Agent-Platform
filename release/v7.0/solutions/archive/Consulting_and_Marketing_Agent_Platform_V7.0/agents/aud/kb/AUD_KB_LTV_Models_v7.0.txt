SECTION 1 - LTV FUNDAMENTALS
================================================================================

LTV DEFINITION

Customer Lifetime Value (LTV or CLV) represents the total net profit a business expects to earn from a customer relationship over its entire duration. LTV guides acquisition spending, retention investment, and customer prioritization.

LTV USE CASES

ACQUISITION EFFICIENCY
- Set maximum allowable CAC by customer segment
- Guide channel selection based on customer quality
- Optimize bidding strategies by predicted value

RETENTION PRIORITIZATION
- Identify customers worth saving
- Allocate retention budget by value tier
- Trigger proactive outreach for at-risk high-value

SEGMENTATION ENRICHMENT
- Add value dimension to behavioral segments
- Create value-based targeting tiers
- Prioritize audiences by expected return

BUSINESS PLANNING
- Forecast revenue from customer cohorts
- Value customer base for financial reporting
- Model impact of retention improvements

LTV COMPONENTS

AVERAGE ORDER VALUE (AOV)
Total Revenue / Number of Orders
Represents typical transaction size

PURCHASE FREQUENCY (F)
Number of Orders / Number of Customers (in period)
Represents purchase cadence

CUSTOMER LIFESPAN (L)
Average duration of active customer relationship
Typically measured in years

GROSS MARGIN (GM)
(Revenue - COGS) / Revenue
Represents profit contribution per dollar

================================================================================
SECTION 2 - DETERMINISTIC LTV MODELS
================================================================================

SIMPLE HISTORIC LTV

Formula: Historic_LTV = Total_Revenue_from_Customer

Use when:
- Customer relationship complete
- Historical analysis
- Simple cohort reporting

Limitations:
- No future prediction
- Biased toward older customers
- Cannot guide prospecting

AVERAGE LTV

Formula: Average_LTV = Total_Customer_Revenue / Total_Customers

Use when:
- Benchmarking across periods
- Simple business metrics
- Quick estimation

Limitations:
- Ignores customer heterogeneity
- Skewed by outliers
- No predictive power

SIMPLE PROJECTED LTV

Formula: Simple_LTV = AOV x Purchase_Frequency x Customer_Lifespan x Gross_Margin

Components:
- AOV: Average order value
- Purchase_Frequency: Orders per year
- Customer_Lifespan: Expected years active
- Gross_Margin: Profit margin percentage

Example calculation:
- AOV: $75
- Frequency: 4 purchases per year
- Lifespan: 3 years
- Margin: 40 percent
- LTV = $75 x 4 x 3 x 0.40 = $360

Use when:
- Quick estimation needed
- Limited data available
- Segment-level analysis

Limitations:
- Assumes constant behavior
- Ignores churn probability
- No confidence intervals

================================================================================
SECTION 3 - COHORT-BASED LTV
================================================================================

COHORT ANALYSIS APPROACH

Cohort LTV tracks customer groups acquired in the same period through their lifecycle to understand true value development.

COHORT DEFINITION
Group customers by acquisition period:
- Monthly cohorts for fast-cycle businesses
- Quarterly cohorts for longer purchase cycles
- Annual cohorts for major purchases

COHORT METRICS

COHORT SIZE
Number of customers acquired in period

COHORT REVENUE CURVE
Cumulative revenue by months since acquisition:
- Month 1: First purchase value
- Month 3: Second purchase included
- Month 6: Pattern emerging
- Month 12: Annual value clear
- Month 24: Long-term trajectory

COHORT RETENTION CURVE
Percentage still active by months since acquisition:
- Month 1: 100 percent (by definition)
- Month 3: Typically 60-80 percent
- Month 6: Typically 40-60 percent
- Month 12: Typically 30-50 percent
- Month 24: Typically 20-40 percent

COHORT LTV CALCULATION

LTV_at_Month_N = Cumulative_Revenue_N / Cohort_Size

For projection beyond observed data:
Projected_LTV = Observed_LTV x (1 + Expected_Future_Value_Percent)

COHORT COMPARISON

Compare cohorts to identify:
- Acquisition quality trends (improving or declining)
- Seasonality effects on customer value
- Impact of product or pricing changes
- Channel quality differences

================================================================================
SECTION 4 - PROBABILISTIC LTV MODELS
================================================================================

BG/NBD MODEL (BETA-GEOMETRIC/NEGATIVE BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION)

Purpose: Predict future purchase probability and frequency for non-contractual relationships.

MODEL ASSUMPTIONS
- Customers have latent purchase rate (lambda)
- Customers have latent dropout probability (p)
- Both parameters vary across population
- While active, purchases follow Poisson process

REQUIRED INPUTS
- Recency: Time since last purchase
- Frequency: Number of repeat purchases
- T: Time since first purchase
- Monetary: Average transaction value (for Gamma-Gamma extension)

MODEL OUTPUTS
- P(Alive): Probability customer is still active
- Expected Purchases: Predicted purchases in future period
- Expected Value: Predicted revenue (with Gamma-Gamma)

INTERPRETATION GUIDANCE
- P(Alive) greater than 0.8: Active, maintain engagement
- P(Alive) 0.5-0.8: At risk, reactivation priority
- P(Alive) less than 0.5: Likely churned, low-cost reactivation only

GAMMA-GAMMA MODEL

Purpose: Predict monetary value conditional on purchase.

MODEL ASSUMPTIONS
- Transaction values vary around customer mean
- Customer means vary across population
- Independent of purchase frequency

COMBINED MODEL
E(LTV) = E(Purchases) x E(Monetary Value per Purchase) x Gross_Margin

USE CASE GUIDANCE

USE BG/NBD PLUS GAMMA-GAMMA WHEN
- Non-contractual relationship (retail, e-commerce)
- Variable purchase timing
- Sufficient transaction history (3 plus purchases per customer average)
- Need individual-level predictions

DO NOT USE WHEN
- Subscription business (use survival models instead)
- Very new customers (insufficient history)
- Highly seasonal with limited data

================================================================================
SECTION 5 - LTV TO CAC ANALYSIS
================================================================================

LTV TO CAC RATIO

Definition: Relationship between customer lifetime value and customer acquisition cost.

Formula: LTV_CAC_Ratio = LTV / CAC

BENCHMARK INTERPRETATION

RATIO BELOW 1
- Losing money on customer acquisition
- Unsustainable without improvement
- Action: Reduce CAC or increase LTV immediately

RATIO 1 TO 2
- Marginal profitability
- Limited room for error
- Action: Optimize both LTV and CAC

RATIO 2 TO 3
- Healthy unit economics
- Sustainable growth possible
- Action: Maintain efficiency while scaling

RATIO 3 TO 5
- Strong unit economics
- May be under-investing in growth
- Action: Consider increasing acquisition spend

RATIO ABOVE 5
- Excellent efficiency or under-investment
- Growth opportunity being missed
- Action: Increase CAC tolerance to accelerate growth

SEGMENT-LEVEL LTV TO CAC

Calculate ratio by:
- Acquisition channel
- Customer segment
- Product category
- Geography

Use to:
- Reallocate budget to high-ratio channels
- Set segment-specific CAC targets
- Identify unprofitable customer types

PAYBACK PERIOD

Definition: Time to recover customer acquisition cost.

Formula: Payback_Months = CAC / (Monthly_Revenue x Gross_Margin)

BENCHMARK INTERPRETATION
- Under 6 months: Excellent, aggressive growth possible
- 6-12 months: Good, sustainable
- 12-18 months: Acceptable for high-LTV businesses
- Over 18 months: Concerning, requires strong retention

================================================================================

- CAC Tolerance: 1x average or below

PREDICTIVE VALUE TIERS

For new customers without history, predict tier using:
- Acquisition source (high-LTV channels)
- First purchase behavior (AOV, category)
- Engagement signals (email, app, account creation)
- Demographic indicators (if available and compliant)
