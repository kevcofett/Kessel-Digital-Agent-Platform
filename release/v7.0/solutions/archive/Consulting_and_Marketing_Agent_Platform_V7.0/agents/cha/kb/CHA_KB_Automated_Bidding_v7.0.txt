SECTION 1 - AUTOMATED BIDDING FUNDAMENTALS
================================================================================

OVERVIEW

Automated bidding, also called smart bidding, uses machine learning to optimize bids in real-time across digital advertising platforms. These systems analyze signals beyond human capability to set optimal bid amounts for each auction.

BIDDING EVOLUTION

MANUAL BIDDING
Advertiser sets specific bid amounts for keywords, audiences, or placements. Requires constant monitoring and adjustment. Limited by human capacity to process signals.

RULES-BASED BIDDING
Automated adjustments based on predefined rules. Examples include increasing bids by 20% during peak hours or reducing bids when above target CPA.

SMART BIDDING
Machine learning systems optimizing toward advertiser goals. Processes hundreds of signals per auction. Adapts in real-time to changing conditions.

VALUE-BASED BIDDING
Advanced smart bidding optimizing toward conversion value rather than volume. Prioritizes high-value conversions over maximizing conversion count.

SECTION 4 - PROGRAMMATIC BIDDING
================================================================================

DSP BIDDING MODES

MAXIMIZE PERFORMANCE
Algorithm optimizes toward conversion or engagement goals without cost constraints.

FIXED CPM
Advertiser sets specific CPM bid. Platform bids up to that amount.

DYNAMIC CPM
Algorithm adjusts bids within range based on expected performance.

OPTIMIZE FOR KPI
Algorithm bids based on predicted likelihood of achieving specified KPI.

BID SHADING

DEFINITION
Algorithm technique to bid optimal amount to win auction while avoiding overpayment.

FIRST-PRICE AUCTION CONTEXT
With shift to first-price auctions, bid shading prevents paying full bid when lower amounts would win.

SAVINGS CALCULATION
Shading_Savings = (Submitted_Bid - Clearing_Price) / Submitted_Bid

TYPICAL SAVINGS
15-30% savings compared to naive first-price bidding.

SUPPLY PATH OPTIMIZATION INTEGRATION

BID ADJUSTMENTS BY PATH
Higher bids for direct paths with better quality signals. Lower bids for longer paths with more uncertainty.

PATH QUALITY SIGNALS
- Viewability rates by path
- Fraud rates by path
- Win rate patterns
- Historic performance

================================================================================
SECTION 5 - VALUE-BASED BIDDING
================================================================================

CONCEPT OVERVIEW

VALUE VS VOLUME
Traditional bidding optimizes for conversion count. Value-based bidding optimizes for conversion worth. Same conversion count, higher total value.

VALUE SIGNALS

TRANSACTION VALUE
Actual purchase amount or contract value. Most direct signal.

PREDICTED LIFETIME VALUE
Modeled future customer value based on characteristics. More sophisticated signal.

LEAD SCORING
Predicted quality or close likelihood of lead. Applicable to lead generation.

MARGIN SIGNALS
Profit margin by product or category. Enables profit optimization.

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACHES

CONVERSION VALUE TRACKING
Track actual transaction values in conversion tag. Platform optimizes toward higher values.

ENHANCED CONVERSIONS FOR LEADS
Upload offline conversion data with values. Enables optimization for closed deals not just leads.

VALUE RULES
Apply multipliers based on audience characteristics:
- Geographic value differences
- Device value differences
- Audience segment value differences

CONVERSION VALUE RULES
Adjust reported values based on business knowledge:
- New vs returning customer value
- Category margin differences
- Promotional period adjustments

VALUE-BASED BIDDING SETUP

STEP 1 - VALUE IDENTIFICATION
Determine what makes conversions more valuable:
- Higher transaction amounts
- Better margin products
- Higher lifetime value segments

STEP 2 - VALUE TRACKING
Implement tracking of values:
- Dynamic transaction values
- Offline conversion imports
- Value rules configuration

STEP 3 - STRATEGY SELECTION
Choose appropriate bidding strategy:
- Target ROAS for efficiency focus
- Maximize conversion value for growth

STEP 4 - LEARNING PERIOD
Allow sufficient time for algorithm learning:
- 2-4 weeks typical
- 50+ conversions recommended
- Avoid major changes during learning

================================================================================
SECTION 6 - BIDDING STRATEGY SELECTION
================================================================================

DECISION FRAMEWORK

BY CONVERSION VOLUME

HIGH VOLUME (100+ conversions/month)
- Target ROAS appropriate
- Target CPA appropriate
- Full automation benefits realized

MEDIUM VOLUME (30-100 conversions/month)
- Target CPA generally safe
- Target ROAS may be viable
- Monitor learning status closely

LOW VOLUME (Under 30 conversions/month)
- Maximize Conversions safer choice
- Consider portfolio bidding
- Enhanced CPC alternative

BY BUSINESS OBJECTIVE

VOLUME GROWTH
Use Maximize Conversions or Maximize Value to prioritize scale over efficiency.

EFFICIENCY FOCUS
Use Target CPA or Target ROAS to maintain efficiency while scaling.

PROFITABILITY
Use Target ROAS with conservative targets or value-based bidding.

BY CONVERSION VALUE VARIABILITY

CONSISTENT VALUES
Target CPA works well. Same value per conversion means volume equals value.

VARIABLE VALUES
Target ROAS or value-based bidding. Prioritizing high-value conversions matters.

PLATFORM COMPARISON

================================================================================
SECTION 8 - PORTFOLIO BIDDING
================================================================================

CONCEPT

DEFINITION
Applying single bidding strategy across multiple campaigns for shared optimization.

BENEFITS
- Shared learning across campaigns
- Easier management at scale
- Smoothed performance variability
- Single target for related campaigns

STRUCTURE CONSIDERATIONS

GROUPING CRITERIA
- Similar business objectives
- Related products or services
- Comparable conversion values
- Same target audience

SEPARATION CRITERIA
- Different margin profiles
- Different target geographies
- Brand vs non-brand
- Different conversion types

PORTFOLIO EXAMPLES

EXAMPLE 1 - ECOMMERCE
Portfolio for all non-brand shopping campaigns targeting same ROAS. Shared learning across product categories.

EXAMPLE 2 - LEAD GENERATION
Portfolio for all regional campaigns targeting same CPA. Regional variations smooth out at portfolio level.

EXAMPLE 3 - BRAND VS NON-BRAND
Separate portfolios for brand and non-brand due to fundamentally different efficiency profiles.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

SETUP
1. Create portfolio with meaningful name
2. Add relevant campaigns
3. Set unified target
4. Monitor portfolio-level metrics

OPTIMIZATION
- Evaluate at portfolio level, not campaign
- Allow campaigns to vary individually
- Adjust portfolio target based on aggregate performance
- Add or remove campaigns thoughtfully

================================================================================
SECTION 9 - ADVANCED BIDDING TACTICS
================================================================================

SEASONALITY ADJUSTMENTS

PURPOSE
Account for expected performance changes during specific periods.

APPLICATION
- Product launches with expected lift
- Promotional periods
- Seasonal peaks
- External events

IMPLEMENTATION
- Set adjustment date range
- Specify expected conversion rate change
- Platform adjusts bidding temporarily
- Remove after period ends

DATA EXCLUSIONS

PURPOSE
Remove anomalous periods from algorithm learning.

USE CASES
- Site outages
- Tracking issues
- Atypical promotional periods
- External disruptions

IMPLEMENTATION
- Select date range to exclude
- Data removed from learning
- Use sparingly for true anomalies

BID ADJUSTMENTS WITH AUTOMATION

LIMITED APPLICATION
Most adjustments redundant with smart bidding. Algorithm already considers:
- Device performance
- Geographic performance
- Time of day patterns

VALID EXCEPTIONS
- Hard constraints (no mobile, specific geos)
- Business rules override algorithm
- Audience bid adjustments for observation

RECOMMENDATION
Remove most manual adjustments when using smart bidding. Let algorithm optimize.

MEASUREMENT
- Compare key metrics
- Account for volume differences
- Consider secondary metrics
- Evaluate holistically

ITERATION
- Implement winning strategy
- Continue testing alternatives
- Refine targets based on learnings
