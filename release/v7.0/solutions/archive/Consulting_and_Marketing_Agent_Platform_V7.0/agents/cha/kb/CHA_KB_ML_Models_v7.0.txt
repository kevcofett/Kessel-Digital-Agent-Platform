OVERVIEW

This document describes the machine learning models available to the Channel Agent for media mix modeling, reach and frequency optimization, and channel performance prediction.

AVAILABLE ML MODELS

MEDIA MIX MODEL
- Endpoint: kdap-media-mix
- Purpose: Quantify channel contribution and optimize allocation
- Model Type: Bayesian Marketing Mix Model with Ridge regression
- Input Features: Weekly spend by channel, sales/conversions, seasonality, external factors
- Output: Channel contribution percentages, ROI by channel, optimal mix recommendation
- When to Use: Annual planning, budget reallocation, channel justification
- Fallback: Use historical share-of-voice analysis

REACH AND FREQUENCY MODEL
- Endpoint: kdap-reach-freq
- Purpose: Optimize reach vs frequency tradeoffs
- Model Type: Beta-binomial reach curves with frequency capping
- Input Features: Impressions, unique reach, frequency distribution, channel type
- Output: Effective reach at target frequency, optimal frequency cap, waste estimates
- When to Use: Awareness campaigns, cross-channel planning
- Fallback: Use standard reach curves by channel

MEDIA MIX MODEL FEATURES

ADSTOCK TRANSFORMATION
- Models carryover effects of advertising
- Decay rates learned per channel
- Typical decay: TV 0.7, Digital 0.3, Print 0.5, OOH 0.6, Radio 0.4

SATURATION CURVES
- Models diminishing returns
- Inflection points identified per channel
- Useful for optimal spend level recommendations

SYNERGY EFFECTS
- Cross-channel interaction terms
- Identifies complementary channel pairs
- Common synergies: TV plus Digital, Social plus Search

DATA REQUIREMENTS

MEDIA MIX MODEL
- Minimum 104 weeks (2 years) spend and outcome data
- Weekly granularity preferred
- All major channels must have spend variation
- Outcome metric must have sufficient variance

REACH FREQUENCY MODEL
- Campaign-level impression and reach data
- Frequency distribution histogram
- Minimum 10 campaigns for reliable curves

INTERPRETATION GUIDANCE

CHANNEL CONTRIBUTION
- Represents incremental impact, not total correlation
- Base sales excluded from contribution calculation
- Sum of contributions equals total lift from media

ROI CALCULATION
- ROI equals incremental revenue divided by spend
- Includes both short-term and long-term effects (with adstock)
- Compare to marginal ROI for optimization decisions

OPTIMAL MIX RECOMMENDATION
- Based on marginal returns at current spend levels
- Constrained by practical minimums and maximums
- Assumes linear scaling within recommended range

---

COMMON USE CASES

ANNUAL PLANNING
- Run full MMM refresh with latest data
- Generate contribution percentages for budget justification
- Identify optimal allocation for target outcome

MID-FLIGHT OPTIMIZATION
- Use current period data to assess pacing
- Identify underperforming channels for reallocation
- Model scenarios for budget shifts

POST-CAMPAIGN ANALYSIS
- Measure actual vs expected contribution
- Identify learnings for future campaigns
- Update response curves with new data points
