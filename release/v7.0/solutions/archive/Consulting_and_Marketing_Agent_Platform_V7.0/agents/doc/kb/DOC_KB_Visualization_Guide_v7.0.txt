DOC DATA VISUALIZATION GUIDE v1

PURPOSE

This document provides guidance on effective data visualization for media planning documents. Reference when selecting chart types, designing dashboards, or presenting performance data.

VISUALIZATION PRINCIPLES

PRINCIPLE 1 - CLARITY OVER DECORATION

Every visual element should serve communication. Remove chartjunk, unnecessary gridlines, and decorative elements that do not aid understanding. The data is the story.

PRINCIPLE 2 - APPROPRIATE ENCODING

Match the visual encoding to the data type and message. Position encodes quantity most accurately, followed by length, angle, area, and color intensity in decreasing accuracy.

PRINCIPLE 3 - HONEST REPRESENTATION

Never manipulate scales, truncate axes, or use visual tricks that distort the data. Start bar charts at zero. Use consistent scales when comparing. Label clearly.

PRINCIPLE 4 - AUDIENCE AWARENESS

Adapt complexity to audience. Executives need simple, high-level visuals. Analysts can handle detailed, multi-dimensional views. Match the visual to the viewer.

CHART SELECTION GUIDE

COMPARISON CHARTS

Bar Chart:
- Use for comparing discrete categories
- Horizontal bars when labels are long
- Vertical bars when time is involved
- Always start axis at zero
- Best for: Channel performance comparison, budget allocation

Grouped Bar Chart:
- Use for comparing categories across groups
- Limit to 3-4 groups for readability
- Best for: Year-over-year channel comparison, scenario comparison

Bullet Chart:
- Use for showing performance against target
- Compact alternative to gauges
- Best for: KPI status versus goal

COMPOSITION CHARTS

Pie Chart:
- Use sparingly, only for part-to-whole with few categories
- Maximum 5-6 slices
- Order slices by size
- Best for: Simple budget allocation, channel mix overview

Stacked Bar Chart:
- Use for part-to-whole across categories
- Difficult to compare middle sections
- Best for: Channel mix over time, audience composition

Treemap:
- Use for hierarchical part-to-whole
- Good for many categories
- Best for: Detailed budget breakdown, taxonomy visualization

TREND CHARTS

Line Chart:
- Use for continuous data over time
- Multiple lines for comparison (limit to 4-5)
- Best for: Performance trends, pacing, forecasts

Area Chart:
- Use for cumulative trends or part-to-whole over time
- Stacked areas for composition trends
- Best for: Cumulative spend, reach build

Sparkline:
- Use for compact trend indication
- No axis labels, minimal detail
- Best for: Dashboard KPI trends, table embeds

DISTRIBUTION CHARTS

Histogram:
- Use for showing frequency distribution
- Best for: Conversion value distribution, engagement distribution

Box Plot:
- Use for showing distribution summary statistics
- Compare distributions across groups
- Best for: Performance distribution by channel, A/B test results

RELATIONSHIP CHARTS

Scatter Plot:
- Use for showing correlation between two variables
- Add trend line if relationship exists
- Best for: Spend vs conversions, CPM vs CTR analysis

Bubble Chart:
- Use for three-variable comparison
- Size encodes third variable
- Best for: Channel comparison (CPM, volume, efficiency)

MEDIA PLANNING SPECIFIC VISUALIZATIONS

BUDGET ALLOCATION

Recommended: Horizontal bar chart or treemap
- Show channel allocation as percentage and absolute
- Order by spend amount descending
- Include comparison to benchmark or prior period

Example structure:
- Paid Social: 35 percent ($350K)
- Paid Search: 30 percent ($300K)
- Programmatic: 20 percent ($200K)
- CTV: 15 percent ($150K)

CHANNEL MIX OVER TIME

Recommended: Stacked area chart or 100 percent stacked bar
- Show how mix evolves across campaign phases
- Highlight strategic shifts
- Include phase labels

FUNNEL VISUALIZATION

Recommended: Funnel chart or horizontal bar with conversion rates
- Show volume at each stage
- Include conversion rate between stages
- Highlight drop-off points

PERFORMANCE DASHBOARD

Core Metrics Section:
- Large KPI numbers with trend indicators
- Sparklines for context
- Red/yellow/green status versus target

Trend Section:
- Line chart for primary KPI over time
- Include forecast line if applicable
- Shade confidence intervals

Breakdown Section:
- Bar chart for channel contribution
- Table for detailed metrics
- Filter controls for drill-down

REACH AND FREQUENCY

Recommended: Combination chart
- Line for cumulative reach
- Bars for frequency distribution
- Secondary axis for frequency

FORECAST VISUALIZATION

Recommended: Line chart with confidence bands
- Solid line for forecast
- Shaded band for confidence interval
- Actual data as dots when available
- Clear distinction between historical and projected

COLOR USAGE

COLOR PRINCIPLES

Meaningful Color:
- Use color to encode meaning, not decoration
- Consistent color for consistent meaning
- Channel colors should persist across visuals

Accessibility:
- Ensure sufficient contrast
- Do not rely on color alone
- Test with colorblind simulation
- Provide text labels as backup

COLOR PALETTES

Sequential Palette:
- Use for ordered data (low to high)
- Single hue with varying intensity
- Example: Light blue to dark blue for performance tiers

Diverging Palette:
- Use for data with meaningful midpoint
- Two hues diverging from neutral
- Example: Red-white-green for versus target

Categorical Palette:
- Use for distinct categories
- Distinguishable, non-ordered colors
- Limit to 6-8 distinct colors maximum

RECOMMENDED CHANNEL COLORS

Consistent channel colors aid recognition:
- Paid Search: Blue tones
- Paid Social: Lighter blue or purple
- Display/Programmatic: Orange or amber
- Video/CTV: Red or coral
- Audio: Green tones
- Affiliate: Teal

Adapt to client brand guidelines when provided.

TABLE DESIGN

WHEN TO USE TABLES

Tables work best when:
- Exact values matter more than patterns
- Many metrics for few items
- Audience will look up specific values
- Comparisons need precision

TABLE BEST PRACTICES

Structure:
- Logical column ordering
- Right-align numbers
- Left-align text
- Consistent decimal places
- Include totals where appropriate

Formatting:
- Zebra striping for long tables
- Bold headers and totals
- Subtle gridlines or none
- Highlight key cells with background color

Conditional Formatting:
- Use sparingly and meaningfully
- Color scales for magnitude
- Icons for status (up/down arrows, checkmarks)
- Data bars for in-cell comparison

DASHBOARD DESIGN

LAYOUT PRINCIPLES

Information Hierarchy:
- Most important metrics top-left
- Summary before detail
- Logical flow top-to-bottom, left-to-right

Visual Balance:
- Align elements to grid
- Consistent spacing
- White space aids comprehension
- Group related elements

DASHBOARD TYPES

Executive Dashboard:
- 4-6 high-level KPIs
- Simple visualizations
- Green/yellow/red status
- Single page, no scrolling required

Operational Dashboard:
- Detailed metrics and trends
- Filter and drill-down capability
- Multiple pages acceptable
- Daily or weekly update cadence

Analytical Dashboard:
- Exploration-focused
- Interactive filtering
- Multiple dimensions
- Self-service for analysts

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

Chart Mistakes:
- 3D charts that distort perception
- Dual axes with mismatched scales
- Truncated axes that exaggerate change
- Too many categories or colors
- Missing labels or legends

Dashboard Mistakes:
- Too much information per screen
- Inconsistent formatting
- No clear hierarchy
- Decorative elements over data
- Poor mobile responsiveness
