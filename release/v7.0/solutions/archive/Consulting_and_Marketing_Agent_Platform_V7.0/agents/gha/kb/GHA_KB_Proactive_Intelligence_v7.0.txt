GHA PROACTIVE INTELLIGENCE v7.0
VERSION: 7.0
STATUS: Production Ready
COMPLIANCE: KDAP v7.0 Agent Standard

------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE

GHA implements proactive intelligence to surface critical growth issues and opportunities without waiting for user queries. Triggers are evaluated at each workflow step and surfaced according to priority and frequency limits.

------------------------------------------------------------

TRIGGER CATEGORIES

ALERTS - IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED

Critical issues that require immediate user attention:

- Lifecycle stage showing greater than 20 percent decline month over month
- CAC exceeding LTV threshold - acquisition economics unsustainable
- Referral rate below 5 percent baseline - viral mechanics failing
- Retention cliff detected at Day 7 or Day 30 milestone
- Activation rate dropped below 30 percent - onboarding crisis
- Revenue per user declining greater than 15 percent - monetization issue

WARNINGS - RISK MONITORING NEEDED

Risk patterns that should be monitored:

- Growth projection trending greater than 10 percent below target
- Channel saturation indicators - diminishing returns approaching
- Competitive threat in primary acquisition channel
- Regulatory risk identified in growth tactic
- Cohort performance divergence - segment instability
- North Star metric growth rate decelerating

OPPORTUNITIES - IMPROVEMENT POTENTIAL

Positive patterns that can be optimized:

- Activation rate improvement opportunity detected - low-hanging fruit
- Viral coefficient approaching 1.0 - accelerate referral investment
- Untapped referral segment identified - expand program reach
- Growth loop closure opportunity - connect lifecycle stages
- High-LTV segment underserved - increase acquisition investment
- Emerging channel showing strong early performance

RECOMMENDATIONS - PROACTIVE SUGGESTIONS

Actionable suggestions based on analysis:

- Experiment design based on current lifecycle stage weakness
- Tactic pivot based on underperformance data
- Channel reallocation opportunity based on efficiency gaps
- Behavioral trigger optimization based on conversion patterns
- Timing adjustment for retention interventions
- Segmentation refinement opportunity

------------------------------------------------------------

EVALUATION POINTS

TRIGGER EVALUATION AT EACH WORKFLOW STEP

Step 1 Growth Context:
- Evaluate business model risks
- Check for competitive threats
- Assess market timing issues

Step 2 North Star Definition:
- Validate metric selection against patterns
- Check for common North Star pitfalls
- Assess measurement feasibility

Step 3 Lifecycle Analysis:
- Evaluate all lifecycle stage health
- Identify cliff patterns and bottlenecks
- Compare to benchmark thresholds

Step 4 Audience Strategy:
- Check segment stability
- Identify underserved high-value segments
- Assess targeting precision

Step 5 Tactics:
- Evaluate tactic effectiveness patterns
- Check for over-reliance on single tactic
- Identify diminishing returns signals

Step 6 Channels:
- Evaluate channel efficiency
- Check for saturation indicators
- Identify emerging opportunities

Step 7 Projections:
- Compare projections to targets
- Identify risk scenarios
- Check assumption validity

Step 8 Documentation:
- Final opportunity synthesis
- Risk summary for handoff
- Recommendation prioritization

------------------------------------------------------------

TRIGGER THRESHOLDS

ALERT THRESHOLDS

These thresholds trigger ALERT category:

- Lifecycle decline: greater than 20 percent month over month
- CAC to LTV ratio: greater than 1.0
- Referral rate: less than 5 percent of baseline
- Retention cliff: greater than 30 percent drop at milestone
- Activation rate: less than 30 percent
- Revenue decline: greater than 15 percent month over month

WARNING THRESHOLDS

These thresholds trigger WARNING category:

- Projection gap: greater than 10 percent below target
- Channel efficiency decline: greater than 15 percent month over month
- Cohort variance: greater than 25 percent between segments
- Growth deceleration: greater than 5 percent rate reduction

OPPORTUNITY THRESHOLDS

These thresholds trigger OPPORTUNITY category:

- Viral coefficient: greater than 0.8 approaching 1.0
- Activation improvement: greater than 20 percent uplift potential
- Segment value gap: greater than 30 percent LTV difference
- Channel efficiency: greater than 150 percent of average

------------------------------------------------------------

FREQUENCY LIMITS

RESPONSE LIMITS

- Maximum 2 proactive items per response
- Prioritize ALERTS over WARNINGS over OPPORTUNITIES over RECOMMENDATIONS
- Do not repeat same trigger within session
- Space proactive items across workflow when multiple detected

SESSION LIMITS

- Maximum 6 proactive items per full workflow session
- Balance across categories when possible
- Suppress low-priority items if limit reached

REPETITION PREVENTION

Track triggered items in session context:
- Store trigger ID and timestamp
- Check before surfacing new trigger
- Allow re-trigger only if conditions significantly worsen

------------------------------------------------------------

PROACTIVE RESPONSE FORMAT

ALERT FORMAT

ALERT - Critical Growth Issue Detected

Issue: Clear statement of the problem
Impact: Quantified business impact
Evidence: Data supporting the alert
Recommended Action: Immediate next step
Priority: Address before continuing workflow

WARNING FORMAT

WARNING - Risk Pattern Identified

Risk: Clear statement of the risk
Indicator: Data pattern observed
Potential Impact: What could happen if unaddressed
Monitoring Recommendation: How to track this risk

OPPORTUNITY FORMAT

OPPORTUNITY - Growth Potential Identified

Opportunity: Clear statement of the opportunity
Potential Upside: Estimated improvement range
Evidence: Data supporting the opportunity
Recommended Experiment: How to capture this opportunity

RECOMMENDATION FORMAT

RECOMMENDATION - Proactive Suggestion

Suggestion: Clear actionable recommendation
Rationale: Why this is relevant now
Expected Outcome: What implementing would achieve
Effort Level: Relative implementation complexity

------------------------------------------------------------

TRIGGER SUPPRESSION

Do not surface triggers when:

- User explicitly requests focused analysis without interruption
- Trigger has already been surfaced this session
- Trigger threshold is borderline and not clearly exceeded
- Multiple higher-priority triggers need attention first
- User is in documentation step and triggers would disrupt flow

------------------------------------------------------------

INTEGRATION WITH OTHER CAPABILITIES

LEARNING EXTRACTION

When proactive intelligence reveals validated pattern:
- Flag for learning capture if meets criteria
- Document trigger effectiveness for future refinement

ERROR HANDLING

When specialist required for trigger validation:
- Follow graceful degradation if specialist unavailable
- Adjust trigger confidence level accordingly

DEEP RESEARCH MODE

When entering deep research:
- Evaluate triggers at research completion
- Consolidate findings with trigger assessment
