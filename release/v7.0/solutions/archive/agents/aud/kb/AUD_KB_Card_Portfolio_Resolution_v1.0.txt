SECTION 1 - CARD PORTFOLIO FUNDAMENTALS
================================================================================

OVERVIEW

Card portfolio resolution addresses the unique challenge of linking payment card activity to individual consumer identities and understanding the complete payment behavior across a cardholder portfolio. This capability is particularly valuable for financial services marketers and merchants seeking to understand customer lifetime value, wallet share, and cross-sell opportunities. The strategic importance of card-level identity resolution has grown as payment methods proliferate and consumers maintain multiple cards across issuers.

Payment card data provides unique identity signals that complement traditional identifiers. Transaction patterns reveal behavioral signatures, while card-on-file relationships create deterministic linkages across merchants. Understanding how to leverage these signals while respecting privacy and regulatory requirements is essential for effective audience development in financial services marketing.

CARD DATA SIGNAL TAXONOMY

Card-Level Identifiers
- Primary account number hash provides pseudonymous card linkage
- Bank identification number indicates issuer and card type
- Card network identifier distinguishes Mastercard Visa Amex Discover
- Token identifiers from network tokenization services
- Device account numbers from mobile wallet provisioning

Transaction-Level Signals
- Merchant category code indicates purchase type
- Transaction amount provides spend value signal
- Transaction timestamp enables temporal pattern analysis
- Authorization response indicates card validity
- Card present versus card not present flag

Cardholder Attributes
- Billing address from card registration
- Name as appears on card
- Issuer relationship attributes where available
- Credit limit and utilization indicators
- Account tenure and loyalty tier

CARD PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION

Multi-Card Consumer Patterns
- Average consumer maintains three to four payment cards
- Primary card receives sixty to seventy percent of spend
- Secondary cards used for specific categories or rewards optimization
- Credit versus debit allocation varies by income and credit access
- Prepaid and decoupled debit add complexity to portfolio view

Portfolio Evolution Dynamics
- New card acquisition signals life stage changes
- Card closure indicates dissatisfaction or consolidation
- Spend migration between cards reveals preference shifts
- Dormant card reactivation triggered by promotional offers
- Portfolio composition changes with economic conditions


================================================================================
SECTION 2 - CARDHOLDER IDENTITY LINKAGE
================================================================================

OVERVIEW

Linking payment cards to individual identities requires combining deterministic and probabilistic approaches that account for the unique characteristics of card data. The challenge is complicated by privacy restrictions on sharing cardholder PII and the prevalence of multiple cards per consumer.

DETERMINISTIC CARD LINKAGE

Card-on-File Linkage
- Same card used across multiple merchants creates direct linkage
- Tokenized card references enable cross-merchant identity
- Recurring payment relationships provide stable connections
- Subscription services create long-term card-merchant bonds
- Digital wallet card associations link cards to device identities

Authentication-Based Linkage
- Three-D Secure enrollment links card to identity record
- Issuer authentication events provide high-confidence matches
- Fraud alert contacts verify cardholder identity
- Dispute resolution processes confirm legitimate cardholders
- PIN verification provides additional identity confirmation

Address Verification Linkage
- AVS matches connect cards to physical addresses
- Billing address updates tracked over time
- Shipping address correlation for card-not-present
- Address normalization required for effective matching
- Multi-tenant addresses require additional disambiguation

PROBABILISTIC CARD LINKAGE

Behavioral Matching
- Spending pattern similarity across cards suggests same holder
- Merchant visitation overlap indicates shared identity
- Geographic spending patterns provide location signals
- Temporal patterns reveal daily and weekly routines
- Category preferences create behavioral fingerprints

Transaction Sequence Analysis
- Sequential transactions across cards suggest same consumer
- Time gaps between transactions indicate travel or task completion
- Complementary purchases suggest same shopping trip
- Recurring pattern alignment indicates household sharing
- Anomaly detection identifies potential card sharing

Device Association
- Digital wallet enrollment links card to device
- Browser card storage creates cookie linkage
- Mobile app card storage links to device identifiers
- Checkout session data provides temporary linkages
- IP address correlation supplements device signals

LINKAGE CONFIDENCE SCORING

Confidence Factor Weights
- Deterministic links from authentication receive highest weight
- Card-on-file links weighted by merchant category stability
- Behavioral similarity weighted by pattern distinctiveness
- Device associations weighted by identifier persistence
- Geographic alignment provides supporting weight

Score Calibration for Cards
- True match rate varies significantly by linkage type
- Household card sharing creates legitimate ambiguity
- Corporate card programs require special handling
- Authorized user cards share identity by design
- Gift card and prepaid complicate linkage scoring

Threshold Optimization
- Precision-focused thresholds for targeting decisions
- Recall-focused thresholds for suppression decisions
- Use-case-specific threshold selection
- Dynamic thresholds based on data freshness
- Segment-specific thresholds for heterogeneous populations
