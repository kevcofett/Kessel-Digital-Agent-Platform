AUD LOOKALIKE STRATEGY v1

PURPOSE

This document provides comprehensive guidance on lookalike audience strategy. Reference when users ask about seed audience creation, expansion rates, platform-specific approaches, or lookalike optimization.

LOOKALIKE FUNDAMENTALS

DEFINITION

Lookalike audiences are prospecting audiences built by finding new users who share characteristics with a seed audience of known valuable customers. The platform analyzes the seed to identify patterns and finds similar users who have not yet engaged with the brand.

HOW LOOKALIKES WORK

Platform modeling process:
- Analyze seed audience characteristics and behaviors
- Identify statistically significant patterns
- Score non-seed users on similarity
- Create ranked audience based on similarity scores
- Apply expansion rate to determine audience size

Model inputs vary by platform but typically include:
- Demographic attributes
- Interest signals and affinities
- Behavioral patterns
- Purchase history where available
- Engagement signals
- Device and platform usage

SEED AUDIENCE STRATEGY

SEED QUALITY PRINCIPLES

The seed determines the signal. A high-quality seed produces high-quality lookalikes. Quality factors include:

Outcome Clarity:
- Seeds should represent a clear, valuable outcome
- Purchasers outperform engagers as seeds
- High-LTV customers outperform all customers
- Recent converters outperform historical converters

Signal Strength:
- Seed must be large enough for pattern detection
- Seed must be distinct from general population
- Avoid overly broad seeds that dilute signal
- Avoid overly narrow seeds that limit patterns

MINIMUM SEED SIZES

Platform requirements and recommendations:

Meta:
- Minimum: 100 users
- Recommended: 1,000-50,000 users
- Optimal: 5,000-20,000 users
- Diminishing returns above 50,000

Google:
- Minimum: 100 users for Display
- Minimum: 1,000 users for Search
- Recommended: 5,000+ users
- Optimal quality around 10,000-30,000

TikTok:
- Minimum: 100 users
- Recommended: 1,000+ users
- Performs well with smaller seeds due to algorithm

LinkedIn:
- Minimum: 300 matched users
- Recommended: 1,000+ users
- Company-based seeds often outperform individual

Programmatic DSPs:
- Minimum: 1,000 users typically
- Recommended: 10,000+ for stable modeling
- Varies by DSP and data partner

SEED COMPOSITION RECOMMENDATIONS

Best seed types by objective:

For Customer Acquisition:
- High-LTV purchasers (top 20 percent by value)
- Multi-purchasers (2+ transactions)
- Recent purchasers (last 90 days)
- Full-price purchasers (not discount-driven)

For Lead Generation:
- Qualified leads that converted to customers
- High-engagement leads (multiple touchpoints)
- Recent qualified leads

For App Install:
- High-engagement users (DAU/MAU)
- Users who completed key actions
- Users with high session duration
- Paying users if freemium model

For Awareness:
- Brand engagers (video viewers, site visitors)
- Email subscribers with high engagement
- Social followers with engagement history

SEEDS TO AVOID

Poor seed choices that dilute quality:
- All website visitors (too broad)
- Single-page viewers (low intent)
- Bounced users (negative signal)
- Old data (outdated patterns)
- Mixed intent audiences
- Heavy discount buyers only

EXPANSION RATE STRATEGY

EXPANSION RATE FUNDAMENTALS

Expansion rate determines audience size relative to platform population. Lower expansion rates mean higher similarity to seed but smaller reach.

Trade-offs:
- Lower expansion: Higher precision, lower reach, higher CPM
- Higher expansion: Lower precision, higher reach, lower CPM

EXPANSION RATE RECOMMENDATIONS

By objective:

Prospecting for High-Value Customers:
- Start at 1 percent expansion
- Test 1 percent vs 2 percent vs 3 percent
- Rarely exceed 3 percent for value focus

Prospecting for Volume:
- Start at 3-5 percent expansion
- Test up to 10 percent
- Monitor efficiency closely at higher rates

Awareness Building:
- 5-10 percent expansion acceptable
- Prioritize reach over precision
- Expect lower efficiency metrics

PLATFORM-SPECIFIC EXPANSION GUIDANCE

Meta:
- 1 percent: Highest precision, smallest reach (~2M users in US)
- 1-3 percent: Best for performance campaigns
- 3-5 percent: Balanced prospecting
- 5-10 percent: Broad prospecting, expect efficiency loss
- Beyond 10 percent: Rarely recommended

Google:
- Similar Audiences are percentage-based
- Start with similar to converters segment
- Layer with bid modifiers for control
- Test expansion with Performance Max

TikTok:
- Algorithm is more aggressive
- Broader expansions often work
- 3-5 percent good starting point
- Creative quality matters more than precision

LinkedIn:
- Smaller professional population
- 1-3 percent recommended
- Company-based lookalikes often better
- Test individual vs company seeds

LAYERED EXPANSION TESTING

Recommended test structure:

Phase 1: Precision Testing
- Seed audience direct (if targetable)
- 1 percent lookalike
- 2 percent lookalike
- Measure CPA and LTV differences

Phase 2: Scale Testing
- Best performer from Phase 1
- 3 percent lookalike
- 5 percent lookalike
- Identify efficiency breakpoint

Phase 3: Efficiency Frontier
- Run winning expansion rates
- Layer with interest or behavioral targeting
- Test exclusions and suppressions

REFRESH AND MAINTENANCE

WHEN TO REFRESH SEEDS

Refresh triggers:
- Performance decline (20 percent+ CPA increase)
- Seed age exceeds 90 days
- Business model or product changes
- New high-value customer cohorts available
- Seasonal shifts in customer behavior

REFRESH CADENCE BY BUSINESS TYPE

E-commerce:
- Monthly refresh for high-velocity
- Quarterly refresh for standard
- Pre-season refresh for seasonal peaks

Subscription:
- Quarterly refresh typical
- Refresh when churn patterns change
- Separate seeds for acquisition vs retention

B2B:
- Quarterly to semi-annual refresh
- Refresh after major wins or losses
- Align with sales cycle changes

REFRESH BEST PRACTICES

Refresh process:
- Pull updated seed based on recent performance
- Compare new seed to previous seed overlap
- Gradual transition if overlap is low
- A/B test old vs new if significant change
- Document seed changes and rationale

ADVANCED LOOKALIKE STRATEGIES

VALUE-BASED LOOKALIKES

Create tiered lookalikes by customer value:
- Top 10 percent LTV seed for premium prospecting
- Top 25 percent LTV seed for standard prospecting
- Compare performance of value tiers
- Allocate budget by efficiency

EXCLUSION LAYERING

Improve efficiency with exclusions:
- Exclude existing customers
- Exclude recent site visitors (for net new)
- Exclude low-value behavioral patterns
- Exclude competitor employees if B2B

LOOKALIKE STACKING

Combine lookalikes strategically:
- Union of multiple value-based lookalikes
- Intersection of lookalike with interest targeting
- Sequential lookalikes through funnel

INTERNATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

Cross-border lookalikes:
- Source country seed vs target country seed
- Local seeds preferred when available
- Cultural and behavioral differences matter
- Platform modeling varies by region

PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT

KEY METRICS

Track for each lookalike:
- CPA vs seed audience CPA
- LTV of acquired customers
- Conversion rate by expansion rate
- Efficiency frontier (CPA vs scale)

BENCHMARKING

Expected performance patterns:
- 1 percent lookalike: 80-120 percent of seed CPA
- 3 percent lookalike: 100-150 percent of seed CPA
- 5 percent lookalike: 120-180 percent of seed CPA
- 10 percent lookalike: 150-250 percent of seed CPA

Performance varies significantly by vertical and platform.

DIAGNOSTIC SIGNALS

Lookalike issues to investigate:
- Lookalike underperforming broad targeting: Seed quality issue
- Rapid performance decay: Audience saturation
- High CPM with low conversion: Wrong expansion rate
- Performance flat across expansions: Weak seed signal
