AVAILABLE ML MODELS

PROPENSITY SCORING MODEL
- Endpoint: kdap-propensity
- Purpose: Predict likelihood of user conversion
- Model Type: XGBoost Classifier
- Input Features: Visit frequency, engagement metrics, purchase history, email behavior, loyalty status
- Output: Conversion probability (0-1), risk tier (low/medium/high)
- When to Use: Audience targeting, bid optimization, personalization
- Fallback: Use rule-based scoring if ML unavailable

CHURN PREDICTION MODEL
- Endpoint: kdap-churn-predictor
- Purpose: Identify customers at risk of churning
- Model Type: Random Forest Classifier
- Input Features: Recency, frequency, monetary value, engagement trends, support interactions
- Output: Churn probability, days to predicted churn, intervention recommendations
- When to Use: Retention campaigns, proactive outreach
- Fallback: Use RFM-based risk scoring

LOOKALIKE MODELING
- Endpoint: kdap-lookalike
- Purpose: Find audiences similar to seed list
- Model Type: Gradient Boosting with similarity scoring
- Input Features: Seed audience attributes, target pool attributes
- Output: Similarity scores, ranked audience list, attribute importance
- When to Use: Audience expansion, prospecting campaigns
- Fallback: Use attribute matching heuristics

SEGMENTATION MODEL
- Endpoint: kdap-segmentation
- Purpose: Cluster audiences into actionable segments
- Model Type: K-Means with silhouette optimization
- Input Features: Behavioral, demographic, and transactional attributes
- Output: Segment assignments, cluster centroids, segment profiles
- When to Use: Campaign personalization, journey design
- Fallback: Use rule-based segmentation

DATA REQUIREMENTS

MINIMUM DATA VOLUME
- Propensity: 1,000+ users with conversion labels
- Churn: 6 months behavioral history
- Lookalike: 500+ seed users minimum
- Segmentation: 5,000+ users for stable clusters

DATA QUALITY CHECKS
- User IDs must be unique
- Timestamps in consistent timezone
- No negative values for counts/amounts
- Missing values handled via imputation

---

PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS

ML models operate on aggregated or anonymized data only. Never pass:
- Raw PII (names, emails, phone numbers)
- Precise location data
- Financial account numbers
- Health information

Always use hashed identifiers and aggregated behavioral signals.
