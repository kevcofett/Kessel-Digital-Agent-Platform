SECTION 1 - RFM SEGMENTATION FRAMEWORK
================================================================================

RFM FUNDAMENTALS

RFM analysis segments customers by three behavioral dimensions that predict future value and engagement. Each dimension receives a score from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).

RECENCY - WHEN DID THEY LAST ENGAGE

Recency measures time since last meaningful interaction (purchase, engagement, visit). Recent customers are more likely to respond to marketing.

SCORING THRESHOLDS (ADJUST BY BUSINESS)
- Score 5: Within last 30 days
- Score 4: 31-60 days ago
- Score 3: 61-90 days ago
- Score 2: 91-180 days ago
- Score 1: Over 180 days ago

FREQUENCY - HOW OFTEN DO THEY ENGAGE

Frequency measures interaction count within a defined period. Frequent customers demonstrate habit and loyalty.

SCORING THRESHOLDS (12-MONTH PERIOD)
- Score 5: 10 or more interactions
- Score 4: 6-9 interactions
- Score 3: 3-5 interactions
- Score 2: 2 interactions
- Score 1: 1 interaction

MONETARY - HOW MUCH DO THEY SPEND

Monetary measures total value contributed. High-monetary customers justify higher acquisition and retention investment.

SCORING THRESHOLDS (PERCENTILE-BASED)
- Score 5: Top 20 percent (80th percentile and above)
- Score 4: 60th-80th percentile
- Score 3: 40th-60th percentile
- Score 2: 20th-40th percentile
- Score 1: Bottom 20 percent

SECTION 5 - SEGMENTATION FORMULAS
================================================================================

RFM CALCULATIONS

RFM_Score = Recency_Score concatenate Frequency_Score concatenate Monetary_Score
Combined_RFM = (Recency_Score x R_Weight) + (Frequency_Score x F_Weight) + (Monetary_Score x M_Weight)
Default weights: R = 0.35, F = 0.35, M = 0.30

SEGMENT SIZE CALCULATIONS

Segment_Size = Count of customers in segment
Segment_Percent = Segment_Size / Total_Customers x 100
Value_Concentration = Segment_Revenue / Total_Revenue x 100

SEGMENT VALUE CALCULATIONS

Segment_AOV = Segment_Revenue / Segment_Orders
Segment_Frequency = Segment_Orders / Segment_Customers
Segment_LTV = Segment_AOV x Segment_Frequency x Expected_Lifespan
Value_Index = Segment_LTV / Average_Customer_LTV
