DOC EXECUTIVE SUMMARIES v1

PURPOSE

This document provides guidance on creating effective executive summaries for media planning documents. Reference when preparing C-suite communications, board presentations, or leadership reviews.

EXECUTIVE COMMUNICATION PRINCIPLES

PRINCIPLE 1 - LEAD WITH THE ANSWER

Executives read for decisions, not discovery. State the recommendation or conclusion first. Support with rationale second. Details third or in appendix. This inverted pyramid structure respects busy schedules and enables quick decision-making.

PRINCIPLE 2 - BUSINESS OUTCOMES OVER TACTICS

Frame everything in business terms. Revenue impact, customer acquisition cost, market share, competitive position. Translate media metrics into business metrics. CPM means nothing; cost per acquired customer means everything.

PRINCIPLE 3 - CONFIDENCE AND CAVEATS

Be direct about what you know and what you do not. Executives respect honest uncertainty more than false precision. State confidence levels. Note key assumptions. Identify risks and mitigations.

PRINCIPLE 4 - ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS

Every executive summary should answer: What do you want me to do? Approve this plan. Allocate this budget. Make this decision. Be explicit about the ask and the timeline.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY STRUCTURE

STANDARD STRUCTURE

One Page Maximum:
- Opening statement (2-3 sentences)
- Key recommendation (1-2 sentences)
- Supporting rationale (3-4 bullet points)
- Investment summary (1 table or 2-3 lines)
- Expected outcomes (3-4 metrics)
- Risk and mitigation (2-3 points)
- Next steps and timeline (2-3 items)
- Decision requested (1 sentence)

OPENING STATEMENT

The opening must accomplish three things:
- Establish context (what is this about)
- State the situation (why are we here)
- Preview the recommendation (where are we going)

Example opening:
This media plan supports the Q2 product launch targeting enterprise decision-makers. Based on competitive analysis and historical performance, we recommend a digital-first approach with CTV reinforcement. The plan projects 15,000 qualified leads at $85 cost per lead, representing a 20 percent efficiency improvement over Q1.

KEY RECOMMENDATION

State the recommendation clearly and directly:
- What specific action you recommend
- At what investment level
- Over what timeframe
- With what expected outcome

Example recommendation:
We recommend approving the $1.2M Q2 media investment focused on LinkedIn, programmatic display, and CTV, projected to deliver 15,000 MQLs and contribute $4.5M to pipeline.

SUPPORTING RATIONALE

Provide 3-4 compelling reasons, prioritized by importance:

Strategic Alignment:
- How does this support business objectives
- Why is this the right approach for current market conditions
- What competitive advantage does this create

Evidence Base:
- What data supports this recommendation
- How did similar approaches perform previously
- What benchmarks indicate expected performance

Risk-Reward Balance:
- What is the upside potential
- What are the downside risks
- Why is the risk acceptable

INVESTMENT SUMMARY

Present investment clearly and simply:

Format Option 1 - Single Line:
Total Investment: $1,200,000 over 12 weeks (Q2 2026)

Format Option 2 - Simple Table:
Channel allocation: LinkedIn 40 percent, Programmatic 35 percent, CTV 25 percent
Monthly pacing: April $350K, May $450K, June $400K

Include comparison to prior period or benchmark if relevant.

EXPECTED OUTCOMES

Frame outcomes in business terms with confidence levels:

Primary Outcomes:
- 15,000 marketing qualified leads (HIGH confidence)
- $4.5M attributed pipeline (MEDIUM confidence)
- 12 percent improvement in cost per lead versus Q1 (MEDIUM confidence)

Secondary Outcomes:
- 85 percent target account reach (HIGH confidence)
- 15 percent lift in brand awareness among IT decision-makers (LOW confidence, based on prior studies)

RISK AND MITIGATION

Acknowledge top risks and how you will address them:

Example risks:
- Competitive spend increase may raise CPMs by 10-15 percent. Mitigation: Locked rates with key publishers, flexible budget reserve.
- Economic uncertainty may extend sales cycles. Mitigation: Lead nurture program, retargeting budget allocation.
- Platform policy changes may impact targeting. Mitigation: First-party data strategy, diversified channel mix.

NEXT STEPS AND TIMELINE

Specify concrete actions with owners and dates:

Immediate (This Week):
- Approve media plan and budget allocation
- Finalize creative brief for agency

Near-Term (Next 2 Weeks):
- Complete audience build and trafficking
- Launch Phase 1 campaigns

Ongoing:
- Weekly performance reviews
- Monthly optimization recommendations

DECISION REQUESTED

Be explicit about what you need:

Examples:
- Please approve the $1.2M Q2 media investment as presented.
- We request budget approval by Friday to meet launch timeline.
- Decision needed: Proceed with recommended plan or explore alternative scenarios.
