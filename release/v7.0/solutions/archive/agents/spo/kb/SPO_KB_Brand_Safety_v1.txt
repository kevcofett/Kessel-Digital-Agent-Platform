SPO BRAND SAFETY v1

PURPOSE

This document provides guidance on brand safety within programmatic supply paths. Reference when users ask about safety configurations, verification vendors, or suitability strategies.

BRAND SAFETY FUNDAMENTALS

SAFETY VS SUITABILITY

Brand Safety:
- Avoiding content universally harmful to brands

- Higher for custom categories
- Volume discounts available
- Reduces wasted impressions

Post-Bid Measurement Only:
- Typically 0.02-0.05 dollars CPM
- Lower cost, reactive approach
- Good for monitoring
- Does not prevent violations

Bundled Verification:
- Viewability plus safety plus fraud
- Typically 0.10-0.20 dollars CPM
- Efficient for full protection
- Negotiate package pricing

PRE-BID VS POST-BID

Pre-Bid Advantages:
- Prevents violations before they happen
- No wasted impressions on unsafe content
- Proactive brand protection
- Higher value per impression served

Pre-Bid Limitations:
- Reduces available inventory
- May miss false positives
- Classification lag for new content
- Higher cost than post-bid

Post-Bid Advantages:
- Lower cost
- Full impression coverage
- Identifies violations for reporting
- Vendor dispute leverage

Post-Bid Limitations:
- Reactive, damage already done
- Brand already associated with content
- Requires manual remediation
- Violation already counted

Recommendation:
Use pre-bid for high-risk categories and premium placements. Use post-bid for monitoring and lower-risk campaigns. Combine both for comprehensive protection.

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACHES

DSP Integration:
- Most DSPs integrate major vendors
- Enable at campaign or account level
- Set thresholds for blocking
- Monitor impact on delivery

Tag-Based:
- Verification tags in creative
- Measure all impressions
- Works across platforms
- No pre-bid blocking capability

Reporting and Optimization:
- Review violation reports weekly
- Identify problem publishers
- Add to blocklists
- Adjust category settings

MADE-FOR-ADVERTISING (MFA) SITES

DEFINITION AND IDENTIFICATION

What is MFA:
- Sites designed to arbitrage ad revenue
- Content exists to generate pageviews
- Low-quality, often AI-generated content
- Aggressive ad loading, poor experience
- Clicks often accidental or incentivized

MFA Characteristics:
- High ad-to-content ratio
- Slideshow and gallery formats
- Clickbait headlines
- Content farms and aggregators
- Unknown publishers with high volume

Detection Approaches:
- Manual review of top spend domains
- Verification vendor MFA scoring
- Attention metrics analysis
- Session quality indicators
- Publisher transparency research

IMPACT ON CAMPAIGNS

Attention Metrics:
- MFA sites have very low attention
- Ads may load but not be seen
- Viewability may technically pass
- Actual human attention near zero

Waste Calculation:
MFA Waste = MFA Spend x (1 - Attention Factor)
Example: 100,000 dollars MFA spend, 10% attention
Waste = 100,000 x 0.90 = 90,000 dollars wasted

Hidden Costs Beyond CPM:
- Brand reputation risk
- False performance signals
- Wasted creative effort
- Opportunity cost of real media

AVOIDANCE STRATEGIES

Inclusion Lists:
- Only buy from approved publishers
- Highest protection, limited scale
- Good for premium campaigns
- Requires list maintenance

Quality Floors:
- Set minimum quality thresholds
- Use verification vendor scores
- Balance protection with scale
- Test threshold impact on delivery

Verification Tools:
- DV MFA detection
- IAS quality scoring
- MOAT attention metrics
- Multiple signals recommended

Publisher Transparency:
- Research unfamiliar publishers
- Check ads.txt and sellers.json
- Review site content quality
- Trust but verify supply paths

INCLUSION VS EXCLUSION STRATEGIES

BLOCKLIST MANAGEMENT

Standard Categories:
- Start with GARM floor categories
- Add industry-specific exclusions
- Review quarterly for updates
- Monitor for over-blocking

Custom Lists:
- Brand-specific blocked domains
- Competitor exclusions
- Problem publisher additions
- Requires ongoing maintenance

Maintenance Requirements:
- Review violation reports monthly
- Add new problem domains
- Remove false positives
- Update for URL changes

Blocklist Limitations:
- Cannot block what you do not know
- New domains appear constantly
- Sophisticated actors rotate domains
- Reactive by nature

INCLUSION LIST BENEFITS

Quality Control:
- Know exactly where ads appear
- Highest brand safety possible
- Transparent to stakeholders
- Premium inventory access

Transparency:
- Full visibility into placements
- Easier reporting and governance
- Builds trust with leadership
- Simplifies compliance

TRADE-OFFS WITH SCALE

Scale Impact:
- Inclusion lists reduce reach
- May limit targeting effectiveness
- Higher CPMs for premium inventory
- Requires balance with goals

Minimum Viable List:
- 500-1000 domains for broad reach
- 100-200 domains for premium focus
- Expand based on performance
- Monitor reach impact

HYBRID APPROACHES

Premium Tier Plus Verified Open:
- Tier 1: Inclusion list only
- Tier 2: Open with pre-bid filtering
- Allocate budget by tier
- Test and optimize allocation

Testing Framework:
- Run A/B tests by safety level
- Compare performance and safety
- Optimize allocation over time
- Document findings for benchmarks

CONTEXTUAL SAFETY

KEYWORD BLOCKING

How It Works:
- Block pages containing keywords
- Simple but blunt approach
- High false positive rate
- Example: blocking gun blocks Super Bowl shotgun formation

Limitations:
- Context not considered
- News blocked inappropriately
- Over-blocking harms publishers
- Reduces inventory unnecessarily

Best Practices:
- Use sparingly for extreme terms
- Combine with contextual targeting
- Review blocked content samples
- Refine lists based on findings

SEMANTIC VS KEYWORD

Keyword Blocking:
- Matches exact words
- No understanding of meaning
- High false positive rate
- Simple to implement

Semantic Analysis:
- Understands page meaning
- Classifies content intent
- Lower false positive rate
- More sophisticated technology

Recommendation:
Prefer semantic classification over keyword blocking. Reserve keywords for terms that are universally problematic regardless of context.

CONTEXTUAL TARGETING

Positive Targeting for Safety:
- Target safe content categories
- Sports, entertainment, lifestyle
- Known-safe publishers
- Proactive rather than reactive

AI-Powered Classification:
- Machine learning content analysis
- Image and video recognition
- Real-time classification
- Improving accuracy over time

NEWS ADJACENCY

Challenge:
- News covers inherently sensitive topics
- Blocking news hurts quality publishers
- Important information for advertisers
- Brand adjacency concerns real

Responsible News Support:
- Support quality journalism
- Block specific articles, not outlets
- Use sentiment analysis
- Consider NEWS exception lists

Nuanced Blocking:
- Block only negative sentiment
- Allow neutral and positive coverage
- Topic-level rather than outlet-level
- Review false positive impact

SAFETY BY CHANNEL
