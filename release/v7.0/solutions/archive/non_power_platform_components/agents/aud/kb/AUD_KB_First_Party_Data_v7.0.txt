AUD FIRST-PARTY DATA STRATEGY v1

PURPOSE

This document provides guidance on first-party data activation, customer data platform integration, clean room collaboration, and privacy-compliant audience strategies. Reference this document when users discuss CDP implementation, data partnerships, identity resolution, or privacy requirements.

FIRST-PARTY DATA FUNDAMENTALS

DEFINITION AND VALUE

First-party data is information collected directly from customers through owned touchpoints including websites, apps, CRM, transactions, email, loyalty programs, and customer service interactions.

Value Hierarchy:
- First-party: Highest quality, directly collected, full consent
- Second-party: Partner shared, contractual access
- Third-party: Aggregated, purchased, declining utility

Strategic Importance:
- Cookie deprecation makes first-party data essential
- Higher match rates than third-party segments
- Better personalization through direct relationship
- Compliance advantages with known consent
- Competitive moat when properly activated

DATA COLLECTION TOUCHPOINTS

Website and App:
- Authenticated user behavior
- Product browsing and search
- Cart and wishlist activity
- Content consumption patterns
- Feature usage and preferences

Transactional:
- Purchase history and frequency
- Order value and product mix
- Payment methods
- Shipping preferences
- Return behavior

CRM and Service:
- Support interactions
- Satisfaction scores
- Communication preferences
- Account updates
- Feedback and reviews

Marketing Engagement:
- Email opens and clicks
- SMS responses
- Ad interactions
- Survey responses
- Loyalty program activity

CUSTOMER DATA PLATFORM INTEGRATION

CDP ARCHITECTURE

A Customer Data Platform unifies first-party data from multiple sources into persistent customer profiles for activation across channels.

Core CDP Functions:
- Data ingestion from all touchpoints
- Identity resolution across devices and channels
- Profile unification and enrichment
- Segment creation and management
- Activation to marketing platforms
- Measurement and attribution

CDP Selection Criteria:
- Integration breadth with existing martech
- Identity resolution capabilities
- Real-time vs batch processing needs
- Activation connector library
- Privacy and consent management
- Total cost of ownership

Leading CDP Platforms:
- Segment: Developer-friendly, strong integrations
- mParticle: Mobile-first, real-time focus
- Treasure Data: Enterprise scale, AI features
- Tealium: Tag management heritage
- Adobe Real-Time CDP: Adobe ecosystem integration
- Salesforce CDP: Salesforce ecosystem integration

IDENTITY RESOLUTION

Identity resolution connects customer touchpoints across devices, channels, and sessions into unified profiles.

Deterministic Matching:
- Email address (primary key)
- Phone number
- Loyalty ID
- Account login
- Payment identifier
Match Rate: 60-80% of known customers
Accuracy: 95%+ when matched

Probabilistic Matching:
- Device fingerprinting
- IP address patterns
- Behavioral signals
- Location patterns
Match Rate: Extends reach 20-40%
Accuracy: 70-85% depending on signals

Identity Graph Providers:
- LiveRamp: Largest deterministic graph
- The Trade Desk UID2: Open-source alternative
- Experian: Consumer data heritage
- TransUnion TruAudience: Credit data foundation

Best Practices:
- Prioritize deterministic over probabilistic
- Validate match quality regularly
- Maintain consent for all identifiers
- Plan for identifier deprecation

ACTIVATION STRATEGIES

Audience Activation Patterns:
- Suppression: Exclude existing customers from acquisition
- Lookalike: Find prospects similar to best customers
- Retargeting: Re-engage known visitors
- Personalization: Tailor creative by segment
- Sequential: Progress through message sequence

Platform Activation:
- Meta Custom Audiences: Email/phone match
- Google Customer Match: Email/phone/address
- Amazon Advertiser Audiences: Email match
- The Trade Desk: UID2 and LiveRamp
- LinkedIn Matched Audiences: Email/company

Match Rate Expectations:
- Meta: 50-70% for consumer email
- Google: 40-60% for consumer email
- LinkedIn: 60-80% for business email
- Amazon: 30-50% for consumer email

Improving Match Rates:
- Hash emails consistently (lowercase, trim)
- Include phone numbers when available
- Add postal addresses for Google
- Use multiple identifiers together
- Clean and validate data regularly

CLEAN ROOM DATA COLLABORATION

CLEAN ROOM FUNDAMENTALS

Data clean rooms enable secure data collaboration between parties without exposing raw customer data.

Use Cases:
- Retailer and brand collaboration
- Publisher and advertiser matching
- Cross-brand audience analysis
- Measurement and attribution
- Competitive insights (aggregated)

Clean Room Providers:
- AWS Clean Rooms: AWS native integration
- Snowflake Data Clean Room: Data cloud users
- Google Ads Data Hub: Google measurement
- InfoSum: Decentralized approach
- LiveRamp Safe Haven: Identity focus
- Habu: Multi-cloud flexibility

RETAILER COLLABORATION

Retailer clean rooms enable brands to match their data with retailer purchase data for targeting and measurement.

Available Collaborations:
- Amazon Marketing Cloud: Full-funnel measurement
- Walmart Luminate: Purchase behavior insights
- Kroger 84.51: Grocery and CPG focus
- Target Roundel: Premium audience access
- CVS Media Exchange: Health and beauty

Typical Analysis:
- Customer overlap and incrementality
- Purchase lift from media exposure
- Cross-category affinity
- Loyalty driver identification
- Campaign optimization signals

PUBLISHER COLLABORATION

Publisher clean rooms enable advertisers to match audiences for targeting and measurement.

Common Applications:
- Audience matching for targeting
- Reach and frequency analysis
- Attribution and conversion measurement
- Content affinity analysis
- Cross-publisher deduplication

Best Practices:
- Define clear use cases before engagement
