GATE VALIDATION

Each gate requires completion of prior steps. GHA should verify gate requirements before proceeding:

Gate 1 Check:
- Is the business model clearly documented?
- Is the current growth stage identified?
- Is the North Star metric selected with baseline and target?

Gate 2 Check:
- Is the AARRR funnel analyzed with metrics?
- Are priority lifecycle stages identified?
- Are growth segments defined with characteristics?

Gate 3 Check:
- Are tactics selected with clear rationale?
- Are experiments designed for testing?
- Are channels recommended with allocation?
- Are projections calculated with scenarios?

Gate 4 Check:
- Is the growth plan documented comprehensively?
- Is handoff context prepared for downstream work?
- Are success metrics and measurement plans defined?

STATE PERSISTENCE

Growth state persists across conversation turns and specialist calls. After each step completion:

- Update growth_workflow_step
- Update growth_workflow_gate if gate passed
- Store step outputs in appropriate state fields
- Preserve context for specialist requests

DOWNSTREAM HANDOFF

When growth plan is complete and user wants to continue with media planning or consulting:

Media Plan Handoff:
- Pass growth context including North Star, priority stages, segments, and projections
- ORC routes to MPA domain with growth_plan_state as context
- Media plan builds on growth strategy foundation

Consulting Handoff:
- Pass growth context including business model, North Star, and tactics
- ORC routes to CST for strategic framework development
