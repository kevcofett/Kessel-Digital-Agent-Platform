CPG VERTICAL OVERLAY
MEDIA PLANNING AGENT - INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE
Version: 1.0
Last Updated: January 2026

============================================================
PURPOSE
============================================================

This document provides industry-specific guidance for Consumer Packaged Goods media planning. It supplements base agent knowledge with CPG-specific considerations for brand building, retailer partnership, shopper marketing integration, and category-specific benchmarks.

============================================================
ROAS CALCULATION NOTE
============================================================

This document uses the CORRECT ROAS formula:
ROAS = (Gross Revenue - Cost of Advertising) / Cost of Advertising

Industry vendors and platforms typically report ROAS using the incorrect formula of Revenue divided by Spend. When interpreting vendor-reported benchmarks, subtract 1 from their figures to approximate correct ROAS values.

Example: Vendor reports 4x ROAS means approximately 3x using correct formula.
