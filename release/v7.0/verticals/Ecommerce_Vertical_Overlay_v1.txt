Version: 1.0
Last Updated: January 2026

============================================================
PURPOSE
============================================================

This document provides industry-specific guidance for Ecommerce and Direct-to-Consumer media planning. It supplements base agent knowledge with ecommerce-specific considerations for efficiency optimization, shopping campaigns, promotional calendar alignment, and conversion rate improvement.

============================================================
ECOMMERCE MARKET CHARACTERISTICS
============================================================

PURCHASE BEHAVIOR PATTERNS

Ecommerce purchases exhibit distinct characteristics:

- Average consideration window ranges from impulse to 2 weeks for most categories
- Mobile traffic exceeds desktop but desktop maintains higher conversion rates
- Cart abandonment rates average 70% across categories
- Peak shopping hours occur between 8pm and 10pm local time
- Weekend traffic lower but often higher conversion intent

CUSTOMER VALUE DISTRIBUTION

Ecommerce customer bases follow predictable patterns:

- Top 10% of customers generate 40% to 60% of revenue
- First-time purchasers have 20% to 30% repurchase probability
- Second-time purchasers have 40% to 50% repurchase probability
- Email subscribers convert at 3x to 5x higher rate than non-subscribers
- Loyalty program members deliver 2x to 3x higher lifetime value

SEASONALITY FACTORS

Ecommerce experiences significant seasonal variation:

- Q4 represents 30% to 50% of annual revenue for most retailers
- Black Friday through Cyber Monday drives 15% to 25% of Q4 revenue
- January sees significant traffic from gift card redemption
- Category-specific peaks require advance planning
- Inventory availability constrains media scaling during peak periods

============================================================
ROAS CALCULATION - CORRECT FORMULA
============================================================

CRITICAL DEFINITION

ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) measures actual return, not revenue ratio.

CORRECT FORMULA
ROAS = (Gross Revenue - Cost of Advertising) / Cost of Advertising

This formula calculates the NET RETURN per dollar of advertising investment.

IMPORTANT: Almost all vendors and practitioners use the incorrect formula of Revenue divided by Spend. The correct formula subtracts advertising cost from revenue before dividing, yielding true return on investment.

EXAMPLE CALCULATION - CORRECT METHOD
- Advertising spend: 10,000 USD
- Gross revenue generated: 40,000 USD
- ROAS = (40,000 - 10,000) / 10,000 = 3.0

Interpretation: For every dollar spent on advertising, you receive 3 dollars in net return after recovering your advertising cost.

COMPARISON TO INCORRECT METHOD
- Incorrect formula: 40,000 / 10,000 = 4.0x
- Correct formula: (40,000 - 10,000) / 10,000 = 3.0

The incorrect method overstates performance by 1.0 because it fails to account for the advertising cost itself.

ROAS BREAKEVEN POINT
- Correct formula breakeven: ROAS = 0 (revenue equals ad spend, no net return)
- Incorrect formula breakeven: ROAS = 1.0x (misleading)

When using the correct formula, any positive ROAS indicates profit after recovering advertising costs.

============================================================
TARGET ROAS CALCULATION
============================================================

Establish ROAS targets based on unit economics:

CONTRIBUTION MARGIN METHOD
- Calculate gross margin after product cost
- Subtract variable fulfillment and shipping costs
- Subtract customer service and returns allocation
- Remaining margin sets maximum allowable acquisition cost
- ROAS target derived from margin structure

EXAMPLE CALCULATION
- Product price: 100 USD
- Product cost: 40 USD (40% COGS)
- Shipping and fulfillment: 10 USD
- Returns and service: 5 USD
- Contribution margin: 45 USD
- Target CAC: 30 USD (allowing 15 USD profit per order)
- At 30 USD ad spend generating 100 USD revenue:
- ROAS = (100 - 30) / 30 = 2.33

This means you need a ROAS of at least 2.33 to achieve target profitability.

ROAS BY FUNNEL STAGE

Different campaign types require different ROAS expectations:

PROSPECTING CAMPAIGNS
- Target ROAS: 1.0 to 2.5 depending on margin structure
- Focus: customer acquisition and list building
- Attribution: first-click or linear models
- Optimization: cost per new customer acquired

RETARGETING CAMPAIGNS
- Target ROAS: 4.0 to 8.0 typical range
- Focus: cart abandonment and browse recovery
- Attribution: last-click or position-based models
- Optimization: return rate and frequency capping

BRAND CAMPAIGNS
- Target ROAS: 0 to 1.0 or brand lift metrics
- Focus: awareness and consideration among new audiences
- Attribution: view-through and cross-device
- Optimization: reach and brand search lift

============================================================
SHOPPING CAMPAIGN STRATEGY
============================================================

GOOGLE SHOPPING STRUCTURE

Organize shopping campaigns for control and optimization:

PRIORITY CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE
- High Priority: new customer acquisition and high-margin products
- Medium Priority: standard catalog coverage and remarketing
- Low Priority: catch-all for comprehensive coverage

PRODUCT SEGMENTATION
- Segment by margin tier to apply appropriate ROAS targets
- Segment by category for budget control and optimization
- Segment by brand for competitive positioning
- Segment by price point for audience alignment
- Segment by inventory status to prevent wasted spend

PERFORMANCE MAX CONSIDERATIONS

Performance Max campaigns require specific management:

- Asset groups should align to product categories or customer segments
- Audience signals should include customer lists and in-market segments
- Search themes should supplement automated targeting
- Negative keywords not available but brand exclusions possible
- Budget pacing less controllable than standard shopping
- Incremental reach versus standard shopping requires testing

META ADVANTAGE SHOPPING

Meta shopping campaign optimization:

- Advantage Plus Shopping Campaigns provide automated optimization
- Catalog sales campaigns enable product-level targeting
- Dynamic product ads require feed quality maintenance
- Conversion API implementation critical for signal quality
- Audience segmentation through custom audiences and lookalikes

============================================================
PROMOTIONAL CALENDAR ALIGNMENT
============================================================

============================================================
CART ABANDONMENT STRATEGY
============================================================

ABANDONMENT RECOVERY CHANNELS

Multi-channel approach to cart recovery:

EMAIL SEQUENCES
- First email: 1 hour after abandonment with cart contents
- Second email: 24 hours with social proof or urgency
- Third email: 72 hours with incentive if appropriate
- Average recovery rate: 5% to 15% of abandoners

RETARGETING ADS
- Facebook and Instagram dynamic product ads
- Google display remarketing with cart products
- Connected TV for high-value abandonments
- Frequency cap: 3 to 5 impressions per day maximum

SMS RECOVERY
- Immediate notification if SMS consent exists
- Recovery rate often higher than email
- Use sparingly to avoid opt-out fatigue
- Include direct link to checkout

ABANDONMENT SEGMENTATION

Treat abandoners differently based on behavior:

- First-time visitor abandoners need trust building
- Repeat visitor abandoners may need incentive
- Logged-in user abandoners can receive saved cart reminders
- High-value cart abandoners justify phone outreach
- Mobile abandoners may need simplified checkout options

============================================================
REMARKETING WINDOWS
============================================================

OPTIMAL WINDOW DURATION

Match remarketing window to purchase cycle:

IMPULSE CATEGORIES
- Window: 3 to 7 days
- Examples: apparel basics, accessories, beauty
- Frequency: higher acceptable due to short cycle
- Urgency messaging effective

CONSIDERED CATEGORIES
- Window: 14 to 30 days
- Examples: electronics, furniture, appliances
- Frequency: moderate to avoid fatigue
- Educational and comparison content valuable

HIGH-TICKET CATEGORIES
- Window: 30 to 90 days
- Examples: luxury goods, major appliances, travel
- Frequency: lower with longer gaps between impressions
- Trust and validation content important

AUDIENCE TIERING

Create remarketing tiers by engagement level:

- Tier 1: cart abandoners within 7 days - highest bid
- Tier 2: product page viewers within 14 days
- Tier 3: category page viewers within 21 days
- Tier 4: any site visitor within 30 days
- Tier 5: email subscribers not recently engaged
