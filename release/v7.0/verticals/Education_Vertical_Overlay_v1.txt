SECTION 2 - KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
================================================================================

ENROLLMENT METRICS

INQUIRIES
Initial contact or information request.
Cost per inquiry target: $10-50

APPLICATIONS
Submitted application for enrollment.
Cost per application: $50-300 (varies by program)

ENROLLMENTS
Confirmed enrollment and deposit.
Cost per enrollment: $200-2,000+

YIELD RATE
Percentage of admits who enroll.
Typical range: 20-50% depending on selectivity.

MELT RATE
Percentage of deposits who do not start.
Target: Under 10%.

ENGAGEMENT METRICS

CAMPUS VISITS
Physical or virtual visit completions.
High conversion indicator.

CONTENT ENGAGEMENT
Program pages, virtual tours, webinars.
Early funnel signals.

APPLICATION PROGRESS
Started vs completed applications.
Identify friction points.

LIFETIME VALUE METRICS

STUDENT LIFETIME VALUE
Total tuition and fees over enrollment period.

CALCULATION
LTV = Years_Enrolled x Annual_Tuition x Retention_Rate

EXAMPLE
- Annual tuition: $20,000
- Average years: 3.5
- Retention rate: 85%
- LTV = 3.5 x $20,000 x 0.85 = $59,500

ALUMNI VALUE
Long-term giving, referrals, graduate programs.
Often not included in marketing ROI but significant.

ROAS CALCULATION

EDUCATION ROAS
ROAS = (Enrollment_Revenue - Marketing_Spend) / Marketing_Spend

Where Enrollment_Revenue = Enrollments x LTV

EXAMPLE
- Marketing spend: $500,000
- Enrollments: 100
- LTV: $50,000
- Revenue: 100 x $50,000 = $5,000,000
- ROAS = ($5,000,000 - $500,000) / $500,000 = 9.0

Note: This is true ROAS accounting for cost recovery.
