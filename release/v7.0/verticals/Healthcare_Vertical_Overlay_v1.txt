Last Updated: January 2026

============================================================
PURPOSE
============================================================

This document provides industry-specific guidance for Healthcare media planning. It supplements base agent knowledge with healthcare-specific considerations including HIPAA compliance, HCP versus DTC targeting, condition-based restrictions, and pharmacy awareness.

============================================================
HEALTHCARE MARKET CHARACTERISTICS
============================================================

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT

Healthcare marketing operates under strict oversight:

- FDA regulates pharmaceutical and device marketing claims
- FTC enforces truth in advertising for health products
- HIPAA protects patient health information
- State-level regulations add additional requirements
- Platform policies further restrict health-related advertising

AUDIENCE SEGMENTS

Healthcare marketing targets distinct populations:

HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS (HCP)
- Physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and clinical staff
- Information needs focus on efficacy and safety data
- Professional channels and contexts preferred
- Peer endorsement and clinical evidence valued

PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS (DTC)
- Direct-to-consumer messaging for prescription awareness
- Condition education and disease state awareness
- Treatment option exploration and advocacy
- Caregiver support and information needs

PAYERS AND INSTITUTIONS
- Insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers
- Hospital systems and healthcare networks
- Employer health benefits decision makers
- Value and outcomes data requirements

DECISION COMPLEXITY

Healthcare decisions involve multiple stakeholders:

- Patients identify symptoms and seek information
- Physicians diagnose and prescribe treatment
- Pharmacists dispense and provide counseling
- Insurers determine coverage and cost sharing
- Caregivers support adherence and management

============================================================
HIPAA COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS
============================================================

PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION

Avoid targeting using PHI elements:

PROHIBITED IDENTIFIERS
- Names and contact information tied to health data
- Medical record numbers and health plan IDs
- Social security numbers and account numbers
- Biometric identifiers and photographs
- Any unique identifying number or code

COMPLIANT TARGETING APPROACHES
- Contextual targeting by content consumption
- Interest-based targeting without health data
- Demographic targeting for condition prevalence
- Geographic targeting by region not individual
- Aggregated and anonymized audience segments

DATA HANDLING REQUIREMENTS

Maintain compliance in data practices:

- Avoid collecting individual health information
- Use aggregate and modeled audiences only
- Work with verified compliant data partners
- Implement proper consent mechanisms
- Document compliance processes and audits

============================================================
HCP TARGETING STRATEGIES
============================================================

PROFESSIONAL TARGETING CHANNELS

Reach healthcare professionals effectively:

MEDICAL PUBLISHER NETWORKS
- Endemic medical journals and publications
- Continuing medical education platforms
- Medical reference and database sites
- Professional association properties

PROFESSIONAL NETWORKS
- LinkedIn professional targeting by specialty
- Doximity physician network advertising
- Medical society member programs
- Conference and event sponsorship

VERIFIED DATA PARTNERS
- NPI-validated audience segments
- Specialty and practice type targeting
- Prescriber behavior and volume data
- Geographic and facility affiliation

HCP CONTENT REQUIREMENTS

Message appropriately for professional audiences:

- Clinical data and study results emphasis
- Safety information and prescribing details
- Mechanism of action explanation
- Dosing and administration guidance
- Comparative effectiveness where supported

HCP MEDIA BENCHMARKS

Healthcare professional campaign expectations:

- CPM range: 50 to 200 USD for verified HCP targeting
- Email open rates: 15% to 25% for relevant content
- Video completion: 70% to 90% for educational content
- Content engagement: 2% to 5% interaction rate

============================================================
DTC ADVERTISING GUIDELINES
============================================================

FDA REQUIREMENTS FOR DTC

Pharmaceutical DTC advertising requirements:

FAIR BALANCE
- Risk information must balance benefit claims
- Major side effects must be disclosed
- Adequate provision for full prescribing information
- Black box warnings require specific handling

CLAIM SUBSTANTIATION
- All claims must have adequate clinical support
- Comparative claims require head-to-head data
- Superlative claims require documented proof
- Patient testimonials must reflect typical experience

FORMAT REQUIREMENTS
- Broadcast requires major statement of risks
- Print requires brief summary of prescribing info
- Digital requires accessible risk information
- Social requires modified approaches for space limits

DTC TARGETING CONSIDERATIONS

Patient targeting within compliance boundaries:

CONDITION AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS
- Target by condition-related content consumption
- Use modeled audiences based on behaviors
- Contextual placement in health content
- Interest-based targeting for related topics

UNBRANDED DISEASE EDUCATION
- More flexibility in messaging approach
- Focus on symptom recognition and doctor discussion
- Drive diagnosis and treatment seeking
- Build condition category awareness

============================================================
CONDITION-BASED RESTRICTIONS
============================================================

PLATFORM POLICY VARIATIONS

Each platform restricts health advertising differently:

GOOGLE AND YOUTUBE
- Certification required for pharmaceutical advertising
- Restrictions by country and product category
- Remarketing prohibited for healthcare
- Condition targeting limited to approved contexts

META PLATFORMS
- Personal health targeting removed
- Interest-based targeting still available
- Pharmaceutical advertising requires authorization
- Special ad category designation may apply

PROGRAMMATIC DISPLAY
- Publisher and exchange policies vary
- Healthcare-specific private marketplaces available
- Data targeting restrictions apply
- Brand safety considerations paramount

SENSITIVE CONDITION HANDLING

Additional caution required for certain conditions:

- Mental health conditions require careful messaging
- Reproductive health varies by region and platform
- Addiction and substance use have restrictions
- Sexual health advertising limited on many platforms
- Weight management faces increased scrutiny

============================================================
PHARMACY AND FORMULARY AWARENESS
============================================================

PAYER LANDSCAPE CONSIDERATIONS

Understand coverage dynamics in planning:

FORMULARY STATUS
- Preferred tier placement affects patient cost
- Non-preferred status creates access barriers
- Step therapy requirements delay treatment
- Prior authorization adds process burden

- Commercial versus government restrictions

PHARMACY MEDIA OPPORTUNITIES

Leverage pharmacy touchpoints:

============================================================
HEALTHCARE MEASUREMENT
============================================================

PRESCRIPTION METRICS

- Adherence and persistence rates

HEALTHCARE ATTRIBUTION

Navigate measurement complexity:
