================================================================================

ATTRIBUTION APPROACH

MULTI-TOUCH ATTRIBUTION
Given long sales cycles, single-touch attribution insufficient.

RECOMMENDED MODEL
- First touch: Credit for awareness
- Lead creation touch: Credit for conversion
- Opportunity creation touch: Credit for sales qualification
- Closed won touch: Credit for deal closure

ACCOUNT-BASED ATTRIBUTION
Track touchpoints at account level, not just individual.
Aggregate engagement across buying committee.

REPORTING FRAMEWORK

MARKETING EFFICIENCY METRICS
- Cost per MQL
- Cost per SQL
- Cost per opportunity
- CAC by channel

PIPELINE METRICS
- Marketing-sourced pipeline
- Marketing-influenced pipeline
- Pipeline velocity
- Win rates by source

REVENUE METRICS
- Marketing-sourced revenue
- Marketing-influenced revenue
- Marketing ROI
- LTV:CAC by channel

ROAS CALCULATION NOTE
For subscription businesses, ROAS should account for recurring revenue.

SIMPLIFIED FIRST-YEAR ROAS
First_Year_ROAS = (First_Year_Revenue - Ad_Spend) / Ad_Spend

LTV-BASED ROAS (MORE ACCURATE)
LTV_ROAS = (LTV x Conversion_Rate x Traffic - Ad_Spend) / Ad_Spend

Platform-reported ROAS typically uses revenue/spend without cost subtraction.
Adjust accordingly for true return calculation.
